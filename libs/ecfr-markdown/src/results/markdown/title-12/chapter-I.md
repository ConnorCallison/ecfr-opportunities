  PART 1—INVESTMENT SECURITIES

### Part 1

**Authority:** Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1  24 (Seventh), and 93a.

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 63982, Dec. 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

    Interpretations

      § 1.100   Indirect general obligations.

#### § § 1.100

      (a)  Pursuant to § 1.2(b), an obligation issued by an obligor not possessing general powers of taxation qualifies as a general obligation of a State or political subdivision for the purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), if a party possessing general powers of taxation unconditionally promises to make sufficient funds available for all required payments in connection with the obligation.

      (b)  The indirect commitment of the full faith and credit of a State or political subdivision (that possesses general powers of taxation) in support of an obligation may be demonstrated by any of the following methods, alone or in combination, when the State or political subdivision pledges its full faith and credit in support of the obligation.

      (1)  The lease agreement must be valid and binding on the State or the political subdivision, and the State or political subdivision must unconditionally promise to pay rentals that, together with any other available funds, are sufficient for the timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation. These lease/rental agreement may, for instance, provide support for obligations financing the acquisition or operation of public projects in the areas of education, medical care, transportation, recreation, public buildings, and facilities.

      (2)  The agreement must be valid and binding on the State or the political subdivision, and the State or political subdivision must unconditionally promise in the agreement to make payments for services or resources provided through or by the issuer of the obligation. These payments, together with any other available funds, must be sufficient for the timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation. An agreement to purchase municipal sewer, water, waste disposal, or electric services may, for instance, provide support for obligations financing the construction or acquisition of facilities supplying those services.

      (3)  The reserve fund must at least equal the amount necessary to meet the annual payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation as required by applicable law. The maintenance of a refillable reserve fund may be provided, for instance, by statutory direction for an appropriation, or by statutory automatic apportionment and payment from the State funds of amounts necessary to restore the fund to the required level.

      (4)  A statutory provision or agreement must unconditionally commit the State or the political subdivision to provide funds which, together with other available funds, are sufficient for the timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation. Those funds may, for instance, be supplied in the form of annual grants or may be advanced whenever the other available revenues are not sufficient for the payment of principal and interest.

      § 1.110   Taxing powers of a State or political subdivision.

#### § § 1.110

      (a) An obligation is considered supported by the full faith and credit of a State or political subdivision possessing general powers of taxation when the promise or other commitment of the State or the political subdivision will produce funds, which (together with any other funds available for the purpose) will be sufficient to provide for all required payments on the obligation. In order to evaluate whether a commitment of a State or political subdivision is likely to generate sufficient funds, a bank shall consider the impact of any possible limitations regarding the State's or political subdivision's taxing powers, as well as the availability of funds in view of the projected revenues and expenditures. Quantitative restrictions on the general powers of taxation of the State or political subdivision do not necessarily mean that an obligation is not supported by the full faith and credit of the State or political subdivision. In such case, the bank shall determine the eligibility of obligations by reviewing, on a case-by-case basis, whether tax revenues available under the limited taxing powers are sufficient for the full and timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation. The bank shall use current and reasonable financial projections in calculating the availability of the revenues. An obligation expressly or implicitly dependent upon voter or legislative authorization of appropriations may be considered supported by the full faith and credit of a State or political subdivision if the bank determines, on the basis of past actions by the voters or legislative body in similar situations involving similar types of projects, that it is reasonably probable that the obligor will obtain all necessary appropriations.

      (b) An obligation supported exclusively by excise taxes or license fees is not a general obligation for the purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh). Nevertheless, an obligation that is primarily payable from a fund consisting of excise taxes or other pledged revenues qualifies as a “general obligation,” if, in the event of a deficiency of those revenues, the obligation is also supported by the general revenues of a State or a political subdivision possessing general powers of taxation.

      § 1.120   Prerefunded or escrowed bonds and obligations secured by Type I securities.

#### § § 1.120

      (a) An obligation qualifies as a Type I security if it is secured by an escrow fund consisting of obligations of the United States or general obligations of a State or a political subdivision, and the escrowed obligations produce interest earnings sufficient for the full and timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation.

      (b) If the interest earnings from the escrowed Type I securities alone are not sufficient to guarantee the full repayment of an obligation, a promise of a State or a political subdivision possessing general powers of taxation to maintain a reserve fund for the timely payment of interest on, and principal of, the obligation may further support a guarantee of the full repayment of an obligation.

      (c) An obligation issued to refund an indirect general obligation may be supported in a number of ways that, in combination, are sufficient at all times to support the obligation with the full faith and credit of the United States or a State or a political subdivision possessing general powers of taxation. During the period following its issuance, the proceeds of the refunding obligation may be invested in U.S. obligations or municipal general obligations that will produce sufficient interest income for payment of principal and interest. Upon the retirement of the outstanding indirect general obligation bonds, the same indirect commitment, such as a lease agreement or a reserve fund, that supported the prior issue, may support the refunding obligation.

      § 1.130   Type II securities; guidelines for obligations issued for university and housing purposes.

#### § § 1.130

      (a)  An obligation issued for housing, university, or dormitory purposes is a Type II security only if it:

      (1) Qualifies as an investment security, as defined in § 1.2(e); and

      (2) Is issued for the appropriate purpose and by a qualifying issuer.

      (b)  (1) An obligation issued by a State or political subdivision or agency of a State or political subdivision for the purpose of financing the construction or improvement of facilities at or used by a university or a degree-granting college-level institution, or financing loans for studies at such institutions, qualifies as a Type II security. Facilities financed in this manner may include student buildings, classrooms, university utility buildings, cafeterias, stadiums, and university parking lots.

      (2) An obligation that finances the construction or improvement of facilities used by a hospital may be eligible as a Type II security, if the hospital is a department or a division of a university, or otherwise provides a nexus with university purposes, such as an affiliation agreement between the university and the hospital, faculty positions of the hospital staff, and training of medical students, interns, residents, and nurses ( a “teaching hospital”).

      (c)  An obligation issued for housing purposes may qualify as a Type II security if the security otherwise meets the criteria for a Type II security.

    § 1.1   Authority, purpose, scope, and reservation of authority.

#### § § 1.1

    (a)  This part is issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1  12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), and 12 U.S.C. 93a.

    (b)  This part prescribes standards under which national banks may purchase, sell, deal in, underwrite, and hold securities, consistent with the authority contained in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) and safe and sound banking practices.

    (c)  The standards set forth in this part apply to national banks and Federal branches of foreign banks. Further, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 335, State banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are subject to the same limitations and conditions that apply to national banks in connection with purchasing, selling, dealing in, and underwriting securities and stock. In addition to activities authorized under this part, foreign branches of national banks are authorized to conduct international activities and invest in securities pursuant to 12 CFR part 211.

    (d)  The OCC may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that a national bank may acquire an investment security other than an investment security of a type set forth in this part, provided the OCC determines that the bank's investment is consistent with 12 U.S.C. section 24 (Seventh) and with safe and sound banking practices. The OCC will consider all relevant factors, including the risk characteristics of the particular investment in comparison with the risk characteristics of investments that the OCC has previously authorized, and the bank's ability effectively to manage such risks. The OCC may impose limits or conditions in connection with approval of an investment security under this subsection. Investment securities that the OCC determines are permissible in accordance with this paragraph constitute eligible investments for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24.

    § 1.3   Limitations on dealing in, underwriting, and purchase and sale of securities.

#### § § 1.3

    (a)  A national bank may deal in, underwrite, purchase, and sell Type I securities for its own account. The amount of Type I securities that the bank may deal in, underwrite, purchase, and sell is not limited to a specified percentage of the bank's capital and surplus.

    (b)  A national bank may deal in, underwrite, purchase, and sell Type II securities for its own account, provided the aggregate par value of Type II securities issued by any one obligor held by the bank does not exceed 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus. In applying this limitation, a national bank shall take account of Type II securities that the bank is legally committed to purchase or to sell in addition to the bank's existing holdings.

    (c)  A national bank may purchase and sell Type III securities for its own account, provided the aggregate par value of Type III securities issued by any one obligor held by the bank does not exceed 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus. In applying this limitation, a national bank shall take account of Type III securities that the bank is legally committed to purchase or to sell in addition to the bank's existing holdings.

    (d)  A national bank may not hold Type II and III securities issued by any one obligor with an aggregate par value exceeding 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus. However, if the proceeds of each issue are to be used to acquire and lease real estate and related facilities to economically and legally separate industrial tenants, and if each issue is payable solely from and secured by a first lien on the revenues to be derived from rentals paid by the lessee under net noncancellable leases, the bank may apply the 10 percent investment limitation separately to each issue of a single obligor.

    (e)  A national bank may purchase and sell Type IV securities for its own account. The amount of the Type IV securities that a bank may purchase and sell is not limited to a specified percentage of the bank's capital and surplus.

    (f)  A national bank may purchase and sell Type V securities for its own account provided that the aggregate par value of Type V securities issued by any one issuer held by the bank does not exceed 25 percent of the bank's capital and surplus. In applying this limitation, a national bank shall take account of Type V securities that the bank is legally committed to purchase or to sell in addition to the bank's existing holdings.

    (g)  A national bank may securitize and sell assets that it holds, as a part of its banking business. The amount of securitized loans and obligations that a bank may sell is not limited to a specified percentage of the bank's capital and surplus.

    (h) —(1)  A national bank may purchase and sell for its own account investment company shares provided that:

    (i) The portfolio of the investment company consists exclusively of assets that the national bank may purchase and sell for its own account; and

    (ii) The bank's holdings of investment company shares do not exceed the limitations in § 1.4(e).

    (2)  The OCC may determine that a national bank may invest in an entity that is exempt from registration as an investment company under section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, provided that the portfolio of the entity consists exclusively of assets that a national bank may purchase and sell for its own account.

    (3) Investments made under this paragraph (h) must comply with § 1.5 of this part, conform with applicable published OCC precedent, and must be:

    (i) Marketable and investment grade, or

    (ii) Satisfy the requirements of § 1.3(i).

    (i)  (1) Notwithstanding § 1.2(d) and (e), a national bank may treat a debt security as an investment security for purposes of this part if the security is marketable and the bank concludes, on the basis of estimates that the bank reasonably believes are reliable, that the obligor will be able to satisfy its obligations under that security.

    (2) The aggregate par value of securities treated as investment securities under paragraph (i)(1) of this section may not exceed 5 percent of the bank's capital and surplus.

> [61 FR 63982, Dec. 2, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 60098, Nov. 4, 1999; 73 FR 22235, Apr. 24, 2008; 77 FR 35257, June 13, 2012]

    § 1.4   Calculation of limits.

#### § § 1.4

    (a)  For purposes of determining compliance with 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) and this part, a bank shall determine its investment limitations as of the most recent of the following dates:

    (1) The last day of the preceding calendar quarter; or

    (2) The date on which there is a change in the bank's capital category for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.3.

    (b)  (1) A bank's investment limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be effective on the earlier of the following dates:

    (i) The date on which the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) is submitted; or

    (ii) The date on which the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income is required to be submitted.

    (2) A bank's investment limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be effective on the date that the limit is to be calculated.

    (c)  If the OCC determines for safety and soundness reasons that a bank should calculate its investment limits more frequently than required by paragraph (a) of this section, the OCC may provide written notice to the bank directing the bank to calculate its investment limitations at a more frequent interval. The bank shall thereafter calculate its investment limits at that interval until further notice.

    (d) —(1)  In calculating the amount of its investment in Type III or Type V securities issued by any one obligor, a bank shall aggregate:

    (i) Obligations issued by obligors that are related directly or indirectly through common control; and

    (ii) Securities that are credit enhanced by the same entity.

    (2)  The aggregation requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies separately to the Type III and Type V securities held by a bank.

    (e) —(1)  In calculating the amount of its investment in investment company shares under this part, a bank shall use reasonable efforts to calculate and combine its pro rata share of a particular security in the portfolio of each investment company with the bank's direct holdings of that security. The bank's direct holdings of the particular security and the bank's pro rata interest in the same security in the investment company's portfolio may not, in the aggregate, exceed the investment limitation that would apply to that security.

    (2)  A national bank may elect not to combine its pro rata interest in a particular security in an investment company with the bank's direct holdings of that security if:

    (i) The investment company's holdings of the securities of any one issuer do not exceed 5 percent of its total portfolio; and

    (ii) The bank's total holdings of the investment company's shares do not exceed the most stringent investment limitation that would apply to any of the securities in the company's portfolio if those securities were purchased directly by the bank.

    § 1.5   Safe and sound banking practices; credit information required.

#### § § 1.5

    (a) A national bank shall adhere to safe and sound banking practices and the specific requirements of this part in conducting the activities described in § 1.3. The bank shall consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit, liquidity, price, foreign exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic, and reputation risks presented by a proposed activity, and the particular activities undertaken by the bank must be appropriate for that bank.

    (b) In conducting these activities, the bank shall determine that there is adequate evidence that an obligor possesses resources sufficient to provide for all required payments on its obligations, or, in the case of securities deemed to be investment securities on the basis of reliable estimates of an obligor's performance, that the bank reasonably believes that the obligor will be able to satisfy the obligation.

    (c) Each bank shall maintain records available for examination purposes adequate to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of this part. The bank may store the information in any manner that can be readily retrieved and reproduced in a readable form.

    § 1.6   Convertible securities.

#### § § 1.6

    A national bank may not purchase securities convertible into stock at the option of the issuer.

    § 1.7   Securities held in satisfaction of debts previously contracted; holding period; disposal; accounting treatment; non-speculative purpose.

#### § § 1.7

    (a)  The restrictions and limitations of this part, other than those set forth in paragraphs (b),(c), and (d) of this section, do not apply to securities acquired:

    (1) Through foreclosure on collateral;

    (2) In good faith by way of compromise of a doubtful claim; or

    (3) To avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted.

    (b)  A national bank holding securities pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may do so for a period not to exceed five years from the date that ownership of the securities was originally transferred to the bank. The OCC may extend the holding period for up to an additional five years if a bank provides a clearly convincing demonstration as to why an additional holding period is needed.

    (c)  A bank shall account for securities held pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

    (d)  A bank may not hold securities pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section for speculative purposes.

    § 1.8   Nonconforming investments.

#### § § 1.8

    (a) A national bank's investment in securities that no longer conform to this part but conformed when made will not be deemed in violation but instead will be treated as nonconforming if the reason why the investment no longer conforms to this part is because:

    (1) The bank's capital declines;

    (2) Issuers, obligors, or credit-enhancers merge;

    (3) Issuers become related directly or indirectly through common control;

    (4) The investment securities rules change;

    (5) The security no longer qualifies as an investment security; or

    (6) Other events identified by the OCC occur.

    (b) A bank shall exercise reasonable efforts to bring an investment that is nonconforming as a result of events described in paragraph (a) of this section into conformity with this part unless to do so would be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.

  PART 2—SALES OF CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE

### Part 2

**Authority:** Authority: 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 93a, and 1818(n).

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 51781, Oct. 4, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

    § 2.1   Authority, purpose, and scope.

#### § § 2.1

    (a)  A national bank may provide credit life insurance to loan customers pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh).

    (b)  The purpose of this part is to set forth the principles and standards that apply to a national bank's provision of credit life insurance and the limitations that apply to the receipt of income from those sales by certain individuals and entities associated with the bank.

    (c)  This part applies to the provision of credit life insurance by any national bank employee, officer, director, or principal shareholder, and certain entities in which such persons own an interest of more than ten percent.

    § 2.2   Definitions.

#### § § 2.2

    (a)  means a national banking association.

    (b)  means credit life, health, and accident insurance, sometimes referred to as credit life and disability insurance, and mortgage life and disability insurance.

    (c)  includes:

    (1) Ownership through a spouse or minor child;

    (2) Ownership through a broker, nominee, or other agent; or

    (3) Ownership through any corporation, partnership, association, joint venture, or proprietorship, that is controlled by the director, officer, employee, or principal shareholder of the bank.

    § 2.3   Distribution of credit life insurance income.

#### § § 2.3

    (a) Distribution of credit life insurance income by a national bank must be consistent with the requirements and principles of this section.

    (b) It is an unsafe and unsound practice for any director, officer, employee, or principal shareholder of a national bank (including any entity in which this person owns an interest of more than ten percent), who is involved in the sale of credit life insurance to loan customers of the national bank, to take advantage of that business opportunity for personal profit. Recommendations to customers to buy insurance should be based on the benefits of the policy, not the commissions received from the sale.

    (c) Except as provided in §§ 2.4 and 2.5(b), and paragraph (d) of this section, a director, officer, employee, or principal shareholder of a national bank, or an entity in which such person owns an interest of more than ten percent, may not retain commissions or other income from the sale of credit life insurance in connection with any loan made by that bank, and income from credit life insurance sales to loan customers must be credited to the income accounts of the bank.

    (d) The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to a director, officer, employee, or principal shareholder if:

    (1) The person is employed by a third party that has contracted with the bank on an arm's-length basis to sell financial products on bank premises; and

    (2) The person is not involved in the bank's credit decision process.

    § 2.4   Bonus and incentive plans.

      § 3.1   Purpose, applicability, reservations of authority, and timing.

#### § § 3.1

      (a)  This part establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for national banks and Federal savings associations. This part does not apply to Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. This part includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part.

      (b)  Nothing in this part shall be read to limit the authority of the OCC to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

      (c)  Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section:

      (1)  Each national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.

      (2)  Each national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.

      (3)  (i) Each national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk national bank or Federal savings association) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.

      (ii) Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of this part for a market risk national bank or Federal savings association) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.

      (4)  (i) Except for an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.

      (ii) Each market risk national bank or Federal savings association must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.

      (iii) Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must make the public disclosures described in subpart E of this part.

      (d) —(1)  The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit, market, operational, or other risks.

      (2)  (i) If the OCC determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.

      (ii) Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments set forth in subpart C of this part, the OCC may find that a capital element may be included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with § 3.20(e).

      (3)  If the OCC determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the national bank or Federal savings association for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.

      (4)  If the OCC determines that the total leverage exposure, or the amount reflected in the national bank's or Federal savings association's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by a national bank or Federal savings association under § 3.10 is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.

      (5)  The OCC may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the national bank or Federal savings association to the entity. Upon making this determination, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the national bank or Federal savings association for purposes of determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The OCC will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the OCC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.

      (6)  With respect to any deduction or limitation required under this part, the OCC may require a different deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.

      (e)  In making a determination under this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner as the notice and response procedures in § 3.404.

      (f)  (1) Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of this part, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that is not a savings and loan holding company must:

      (i) Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, beginning on January 1, 2014, calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart E and, if applicable, subpart F of this part and, beginning on January 1, 2015, calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D and, if applicable, subpart F of this part;

#### § § 3.3

      For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets under subparts D and E of this part:

      (a)  In order to recognize certain exposures as cleared transactions pursuant to paragraphs (1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of the definition of “cleared transaction” in § 3.2, the exposures must meet the applicable requirements set forth in this paragraph (a).

      (1) The offsetting transaction must be identified by the CCP as a transaction for the clearing member client.

      (2) The collateral supporting the transaction must be held in a manner that prevents the national bank or Federal savings association from facing any loss due to an event of default, including from a liquidation, receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding of either the clearing member or the clearing member's other clients. Omnibus accounts established under 17 CFR parts 190 and 300 satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a).

      (3) The national bank or Federal savings association must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from a default or receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions.

      (4) The offsetting transaction with a clearing member must be transferable under the transaction documents and applicable laws in the relevant jurisdiction(s) to another clearing member should the clearing member default, become insolvent, or enter receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceedings.

      (b)  In order to recognize an exposure as an eligible margin loan as defined in § 3.2, a national bank or Federal savings association must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:

      (1) Meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of eligible margin loan in § 3.2, and

      (2) Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.

      (c)  In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying cross-product master netting agreement as defined in § 3.101, a national bank or Federal savings association must obtain a written legal opinion verifying the validity and enforceability of the agreement under applicable law of the relevant jurisdictions if the counterparty fails to perform upon an event of default, including upon receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

      (d)  In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying master netting agreement as defined in § 3.2, a national bank or Federal savings association must:

      (1) Conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that:

      (i) The agreement meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of the definition of qualifying master netting agreement in § 3.2; and

      (ii) In the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; and

      (2) Establish and maintain written procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the agreement continues to satisfy the requirements of the definition of qualifying master netting agreement in § 3.2.

      (e)  In order to recognize an exposure as a repo-style transaction as defined in § 3.2, a national bank or Federal savings association must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:

      (1) Meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of the definition of repo-style transaction in § 3.2, and

      (2) Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.

      (f)  If a national bank or Federal savings association determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP in § 3.2, the national bank or Federal savings association may continue to treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to three months following the determination. If the CCP fails to remedy the relevant deficiency within three months after the initial determination, or the CCP fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP continuously for a three-month period after remedying the relevant deficiency, a national bank or Federal savings association may not treat the CCP as a QCCP for the purposes of this part until after the national bank or Federal savings association has determined that the CCP has satisfied the requirements in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP for three continuous months.

    Subpart B—Capital Ratio Requirements and Buffers

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 62157, 62273, Oct. 11, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 3.10   Minimum capital requirements.

#### § § 3.10

      (a)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

      (i) A common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent.

      (ii) A tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent.

      (iii) A total capital ratio of 8 percent.

      (iv) A leverage ratio of 4 percent.

      (v) For advanced approaches national banks or Federal savings associations or, for Category III OCC-regulated institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent.

      (vi) For Federal savings associations, a tangible capital ratio of 1.5 percent.

      (2) A qualifying community banking organization (as defined in § 3.12), that is subject to the community bank leverage ratio framework (as defined in § 3.12), is considered to have met the minimum capital requirements in this paragraph (a).

      (b)  Other than as provided in paragraph (c) of this section:

      (1)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets;

      (2)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets;

      (3)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital ratio is the ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and

      (4)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's leverage ratio is the ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital to the national bank's or Federal savings association's average total consolidated assets as reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report minus amounts deducted from tier 1 capital under § 3.22(a), (c) and (d).

      (5)  A Federal savings association's tangible capital ratio is the ratio of the Federal savings association's core capital (tier 1 capital) to average total assets as calculated under this subpart B. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), the term “total assets” means “total assets” as defined in part 6, subpart A of this chapter, subject to subpart G of this part.

      (c)  (1) A Category III national bank or Federal savings association or advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must determine its supplementary leverage ratio in accordance with this paragraph, beginning with the calendar quarter immediately following the quarter in which the national bank or Federal savings association is identified as a Category III national bank or Federal savings association. An advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's or a Category III national bank's or Federal savings association's supplementary leverage ratio is the ratio of its tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, the latter of which is calculated as the sum of:

      (i) The mean of the on-balance sheet assets calculated as of each day of the reporting quarter; and

      (ii) The mean of the off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each of the most recent three months, minus the applicable deductions under § 3.22(a), (c), and (d).

      (2) For purposes of this part,  means the sum of the items described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section for a clearing member national bank and Federal savings association and paragraph (c)(2)(x) of this section for a custody bank:

      (i) The balance sheet carrying value of all of the national bank or Federal savings association's on-balance sheet assets,  the value of securities sold under a repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under GAAP,  amounts deducted from tier 1 capital under § 3.22(a), (c), and (d), and  the value of securities received in security-for-security repo-style transactions, where the national bank or Federal savings association acts as a securities lender and includes the securities received in its on-balance sheet assets but has not sold or re-hypothecated the securities received, and, for a national bank or Federal savings association that uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk under § 3.132(c) for its standardized risk-weighted assets,  the fair value of any derivative contracts;

      (ii)(A) For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses the current exposure methodology under § 3.34(b) for its standardized risk-weighted assets, the potential future credit exposure (PFE) for each derivative contract or each single-product netting set of derivative contracts (including a cleared transaction except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section and, at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association, excluding a forward agreement treated as a derivative contract that is part of a repurchase or reverse repurchase or a securities borrowing or lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under GAAP), to which the national bank or Federal savings association is a counterparty as determined under § 3.34, but without regard to § 3.34(c), provided that:

      () A national bank or Federal savings association may choose to exclude the PFE of all credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection when calculating the PFE under § 3.34, but without regard to § 3.34(c), provided that it does not adjust the net-to-gross ratio (NGR); and

      () A national bank or Federal savings association that chooses to exclude the PFE of credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection pursuant to this paragraph (c)(_2_)(ii)(A) must do so consistently over time for the calculation of the PFE for all such instruments; or

      (B)() For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk under section § 3.__1__32(c) for its standardized risk-weighted assets, the PFE for each netting set to which the national bank or Federal savings association is a counterparty (including cleared transactions except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section and, at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association, excluding a forward agreement treated as a derivative contract that is part of a repurchase or reverse repurchase or a securities borrowing or lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under GAAP), as determined under § 3.132(c)(7), in which the term C in § 3.132(c)(7)(i) equals zero, and, for any counterparty that is not a commercial end-user, multiplied by 1.4. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(), a national bank or Federal savings association may set the value of the term C in § 3.132(c)(7)(i) equal to the amount of collateral posted by a clearing member client of the national bank or Federal savings association in connection with the client-facing derivative transactions within the netting set; and

      () A national bank or Federal savings association may choose to exclude the PFE of all credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection when calculating the PFE under § 3.13_2_(c), provided that it does so consistently over time for the calculation of the PFE for all such instruments;

      (iii)(A)() For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses the current exposure methodology under § 3.34(b) for its standardized risk-weighted assets, the amount of cash collateral that is received from a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has offset the mark-to-fair value of the derivative asset, or cash collateral that is posted to a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has reduced the national bank or Federal savings association's on-balance sheet assets, unless such cash collateral is all or part of variation margin that satisfies the conditions in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(C) through (G) of this section; and

      () The variation margin is used to reduce the current credit exposure of the derivative contract, calculated as described in § 3.34(b), and not the PFE; and

      () For the purpose of the calculation of the NGR described in § _3_.34(b)(_2_)(ii)(B), variation margin described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section may not reduce the net current credit exposure or the gross current credit exposure; or

      (B)() For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk under § 3._1_32(c) for its standardized risk-weighted assets, the replacement cost of each derivative contract or single product netting set of derivative contracts to which the national bank or Federal savings association is a counterparty, calculated according to the following formula, and, for any counterparty that is not a commercial end-user, multiplied by 1.4:

      () Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(_2_)(iii)(B)() of this section, where multiple netting sets are subject to a single variation margin agreement, a national bank or Federal savings association must apply the formula for replacement cost provided in § 3._1_32(c)(10)(i), in which the term C may only include cash collateral that satisfies the conditions in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(C) through (G) of this section; and

      () For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(), a national bank or Federal savings association must treat a derivative contract that references an index as if it were multiple derivative contracts each referencing one component of the index if the national bank or Federal savings association elected to treat the derivative contract as multiple derivative contracts under § _3_._1_32(c)(5)(vi);

      (C) For derivative contracts that are not cleared through a QCCP, the cash collateral received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated (by law, regulation, or an agreement with the counterparty);

      (D) Variation margin is calculated and transferred on a daily basis based on the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract;

      (E) The variation margin transferred under the derivative contract or the governing rules of the CCP or QCCP for a cleared transaction is the full amount that is necessary to fully extinguish the net current credit exposure to the counterparty of the derivative contracts, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty under the terms of the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction;

      (F) The variation margin is in the form of cash in the same currency as the currency of settlement set forth in the derivative contract, provided that for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(F), currency of settlement means any currency for settlement specified in the governing qualifying master netting agreement and the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement, or in the governing rules for a cleared transaction; and

      (G) The derivative contract and the variation margin are governed by a qualifying master netting agreement between the legal entities that are the counterparties to the derivative contract or by the governing rules for a cleared transaction, and the qualifying master netting agreement or the governing rules for a cleared transaction must explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to settle any payment obligations on a net basis, taking into account any variation margin received or provided under the contract if a credit event involving either counterparty occurs;

      (iv) The effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the derivative contract) of a credit derivative, or other similar instrument, through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, provided that:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the amount of any reduction in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative if the reduction is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital;

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative or other similar instrument, provided that the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection and that:

      () With respect to a credit derivative that references a single exposure, the reference exposure of the purchased credit derivative is to the same legal entity and ranks  with, or is junior to, the reference exposure of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection; or

      () With respect to a credit derivative that references multiple exposures, the reference exposures of the purchased credit derivative are to the same legal entities and rank  with the reference exposures of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, and the level of seniority of the purchased credit derivative ranks  to the level of seniority of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection;

      () Where a national bank or Federal savings association has reduced the effective notional amount of a credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must also reduce the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative used to offset the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, by the amount of any increase in the mark-to-fair value of the purchased credit derivative that is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital; and

      () Where the national bank or Federal savings association purchases credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on a credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in net income, but does not record offsetting deterioration in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in net income (either through reductions in fair value or by additions to reserves), the national bank or Federal savings association may not use the purchased credit protection to offset the effective notional principal amount of the related credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection;

      (v) Where a national bank or Federal savings association acting as a principal has more than one repo-style transaction with the same counterparty and has offset the gross value of receivables due from a counterparty under reverse repurchase transactions by the gross value of payables under repurchase transactions due to the same counterparty, the gross value of receivables associated with the repo-style transactions  any on-balance sheet receivables amount associated with these repo-style transactions included under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, un_less_ the following criteria are met:

      (A) The offsetting transactions have the same explicit final settlement date under their governing agreements;

      (B) The right to offset the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding; and

      (C) Under the governing agreements, the counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or settle according to a process that is the functional equivalent of net settlement, (that is, the cash flows of the transactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on the settlement date), where both transactions are settled through the same settlement system, the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both transactions will occur by the end of the business day, and the settlement of the underlying securities does not interfere with the net cash settlement;

      (vi) The counterparty credit risk of a repo-style transaction, including where the national bank or Federal savings association acts as an agent for a repo-style transaction and indemnifies the customer with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty in an amount limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, calculated as follows:

      (A) If the transact**_i_**on is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) for transactions with a counterparty must be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis, such that each transaction  is treated as its own netting set, in accordance with the following formula, where E is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or provided as collateral to the counterparty, and C is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or received as collateral from the counterparty:

      (B) If the transact**i**on is subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) must be calculated as the greater of zero and the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase or provided as collateral to a counterparty for all transactions included in the qualifying master netting agreement (ΣE),  the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association borrowed, purchased subject to resale or received as collateral from the counterparty for those transactions (ΣC), in accordance with the following formula:

      (vii) If a national bank or Federal savings association acting as an agent for a repo-style transaction provides a guarantee to a customer of the security or cash its customer has lent or borrowed with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty and the guarantee is not limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, the amount of the guarantee that is greater than the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has provided;

      (viii) The credit equivalent amount of all off-balance sheet exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association, excluding repo-style transactions, repurchase or reverse repurchase or securities borrowing or lending transactions that qualify for sales treatment under GAAP, and derivative transactions, determined using the applicable credit conversion factor under § 3.33(b), provided, however, that the minimum credit conversion factor that may be assigned to an off-balance sheet exposure under this paragraph is 10 percent; and

      (ix) For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member:

      (A) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that guarantees the performance of a clearing member client with respect to a cleared transaction must treat its exposure to the clearing member client as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;

      (B) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that guarantees the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client must treat its exposure to the CCP as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;

      (C) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that does not guarantee the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client may exclude its exposure to the CCP for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;

      (D) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member may exclude from its total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit protection sold through a credit derivative contract, or other similar instrument, that it clears on behalf of a clearing member client through a CCP as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section; and

      (E) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2)(ix)(A) through (C) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may exclude from its total leverage exposure a clearing member's exposure to a clearing member client for a derivative contract, if the clearing member client and the clearing member are affiliates and consolidated for financial reporting purposes on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet.

      (x) A custodial bank shall exclude from its total leverage exposure the lesser of:

      (A) The amount of funds that the custody bank has on deposit at a qualifying central bank; and

      (B) The amount of funds that the custody bank's clients have on deposit at the custody bank that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), a deposit account is linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account if the deposit account is provided to a client that maintains a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account with the custody bank, and the deposit account is used to facilitate the administration of the fiduciary or custody and safekeeping account.

      (d)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d) must determine its regulatory capital ratios as described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.

      (1)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital ratio is the lower of:

      (i) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and

      (ii) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital to advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.

      (2)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital ratio is the lower of:

      (i) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and

      (ii) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital to advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.

      (3)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital ratio is the lower of:

      (i) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital to standardized total risk-weighted assets; and

      (ii) The ratio of the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced-approaches-adjusted total capital to advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets. A national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced-approaches-adjusted total capital is the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital after being adjusted as follows:

      (A) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from its total capital any allowance for loan and lease losses or adjusted allowance for credit losses, as applicable, included in its tier 2 capital in accordance with § 3.20(d)(3); and

      (B) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must add to its total capital any eligible credit reserves that exceed the national bank's or Federal savings association's total expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserve amount does not exceed 0.6 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit risk-weighted assets.

      (4)  A Federal savings association's tangible capital ratio is the ratio of the Federal savings association's core capital (tier 1 capital) to average total assets as calculated under this subpart B. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), the term “total assets” means “total assets” as defined in part 6, subpart A of this chapter, subject to subpart G of this part.

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding the minimum requirements in this part, a national bank or Federal savings association must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the national bank or Federal savings association is exposed. The supervisory evaluation of a national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy is based on an individual assessment of numerous factors, including those listed at this section (national banks), 12 CFR 167.3(c) (Federal savings associations).

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.

      § 3.11   Capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer amount.

#### § § 3.11

      (a) —(1)  The capital conservation buffer is composed solely of common equity tier 1 capital.

      (2)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      (i)  The eligible retained income of a national bank or Federal savings association is the greater of:

      (A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's net income, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report, for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income; and

      (B) The average of the national bank's or Federal savings association's net income, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report, for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter.

      (ii)  The maximum payout ratio is the percentage of eligible retained income that a national bank or Federal savings association can pay out in the form of distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter. The maximum payout ratio is based on the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, as set forth in Table 1 to § 3.11.

      (iii)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's maximum payout amount for the current calendar quarter is equal to the national bank's or Federal savings association's eligible retained income, multiplied by the applicable maximum payout ratio, as set forth in Table 1 to § 3.11.

      (iv)  Private sector credit exposure means an exposure to a company or an individual that is not an exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, the International Monetary Fund, a MDB, a PSE, or a GSE.

      (3)  (i) A national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer is equal to the lowest of the following ratios, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital ratio minus the national bank or Federal savings association 's minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 3.10;

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital ratio minus the national bank or Federal savings association's minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 3.10; and

      (C) The national bank or Federal savings association's total capital ratio minus the national bank or Federal savings association's minimum total capital ratio requirement under § 3.10; or

      (ii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A)-(C) of this section, if the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio is less than or equal to the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio requirement under § 3.10, respectively, the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer is zero.

      (4)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association shall not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments or create an obligation to make such distributions or payments during the current calendar quarter that, in the aggregate, exceed the maximum payout amount.

      (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association with a capital conservation buffer that is greater than 2.5 percent plus 100 percent of its applicable countercyclical capital buffer, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, is not subject to a maximum payout amount under this section.

      (iii)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter if the national bank's or Federal savings association's:

      (A) Eligible retained income is negative; and

      (B) Capital conservation buffer was less than 2.5 percent as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.

      (iv)  Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, the OCC may permit a national bank or Federal savings association to make a distribution or discretionary bonus payment upon a request of the national bank or Federal savings association, if the OCC determines that the distribution or discretionary bonus payment would not be contrary to the purposes of this section, or to the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association. In making such a determination, the OCC will consider the nature and extent of the request and the particular circumstances giving rise to the request.

      (v)  Additional limitations on distributions may apply to a national bank or Federal savings association under subparts H and I of this part; 12 CFR 5.46, 12 CFR part 5, subpart E; 12 CFR part 6.

      (b) —(1)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, and a Category III national bank or Federal savings association, must calculate a countercyclical capital buffer amount in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for purposes of determining its maximum payout ratio under Table 1 to this section.

      (i)  The countercyclical capital buffer amount is an extension of the capital conservation buffer as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, and a Category III national bank or Federal savings association, has a countercyclical capital buffer amount determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer amounts established for the national jurisdictions where the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures are located, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.

      (iii)  The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures. The methodology a national bank or Federal savings association uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under § 3.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under § 3.210 multiplied by 12.5.

      (iv)  (A) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the location of a private sector credit exposure is the national jurisdiction where the borrower is located (that is, where it is incorporated, chartered, or similarly established or, if the borrower is an individual, where the borrower resides).

      (B) If, in accordance with subparts D or E of this part, the national bank or Federal savings association has assigned to a private sector credit exposure a risk weight associated with a protection provider on a guarantee or credit derivative, the location of the exposure is the national jurisdiction where the protection provider is located.

      (C) The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying exposures, or, if the underlying exposures are located in more than one national jurisdiction, the national jurisdiction where the underlying exposures with the largest aggregate unpaid principal balance are located. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the location of an underlying exposure shall be the location of the borrower, determined consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  The initial countercyclical capital buffer amount in the United States is zero.

      (ii)  The OCC will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for credit exposures in the United States in accordance with applicable law.

      (iii)  The OCC will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for credit exposures in the United States between zero percent and 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.

      (iv)  The OCC will base its decision to adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount under this section on a range of macroeconomic, financial, and supervisory information indicating an increase in systemic risk including, but not limited to, the ratio of credit to gross domestic product, a variety of asset prices, other factors indicative of relative credit and liquidity expansion or contraction, funding spreads, credit condition surveys, indices based on credit default swap spreads, options implied volatility, and measures of systemic risk.

      (v) —(A)  A determination by the OCC under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to increase the countercyclical capital buffer amount will be effective 12 months from the date of announcement, unless the OCC establishes an earlier effective date and includes a statement articulating the reasons for the earlier effective date.

      (B)  A determination by the OCC to decrease the established countercyclical capital buffer amount under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be effective on the day following announcement of the final determination or the earliest date permissible under applicable law or regulation, whichever is later.

      (vi)  The countercyclical capital buffer amount will return to zero percent 12 months after the effective date that the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount is announced, unless the OCC announces a decision to maintain the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount or adjust it again before the expiration of the 12-month period.

      (3)  The OCC will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for private sector credit exposures to reflect decisions made by foreign jurisdictions consistent with due process requirements described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      § 3.12   Community bank leverage ratio framework.

#### § § 3.12

      (a)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a qualifying community banking organization that has made an election to use the community bank leverage ratio framework under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements under § 3.10, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized capital category under § 6.4(b)(1) of this chapter, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying community banking organization is subject, if it has a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a qualifying community banking organization means a national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association and that satisfies all of the following criteria:

      (i) Has a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent;

      (ii) Has total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, calculated in accordance with the reporting instructions to the Call Report as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter;

      (iii) Has off-balance sheet exposures of 25 percent or less of its total consolidated assets as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter, calculated as the sum of the notional amounts of the exposures listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) through (I) of this section, divided by total consolidated assets, each as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter:

      (A) The unused portion of commitments (except for unconditionally cancellable commitments);

      (B) Self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods;

      (C) Transaction-related contingent items, including performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, and performance standby letters of credit;

      (D) Sold credit protection through

      () Guarantees; and

      () Credit derivatives;

      (E) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties;

      (F) Securities lent and borrowed, calculated in accordance with the reporting instructions to the Call Report;

      (G) Financial standby letters of credit;

      (H) Forward agreements that are not derivative contracts; and

      (I) Off-balance sheet securitization exposures; and

      (iv) Has total trading assets plus trading liabilities, calculated in accordance with the reporting instructions to the Call Report of 5 percent or less of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total consolidated assets, each as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.

      (3)(i) A qualifying community banking organization may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework if it makes an opt-in election under this paragraph (a)(3).

      (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), a qualifying community banking organization makes an election to use the community bank leverage ratio framework by completing the applicable reporting requirements of its Call Report.

      (iii)(A) A qualifying community banking organization that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework may opt out of the community bank leverage ratio framework by completing the applicable risk-based and leverage ratio reporting requirements necessary to demonstrate compliance with § 3.10(a)(1) in its Call Report or by otherwise providing this information to the OCC.

      (B) A qualifying community banking organization that opts out of the community bank leverage ratio framework pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section must comply with § 3.10(a)(1) immediately.

      (4)(i)  From December 2, 2020 through December 31, 2021, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the total consolidated assets of a national bank or Federal savings association for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be the lesser of:

      (A) The total consolidated assets reported by the national bank or Federal savings association in its Call Report as of December 31, 2019; and

      (B) The total consolidated assets of the national bank or Federal savings association calculated in accordance with the reporting instructions to the Call Report as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.

      (ii)  The temporary relief provided under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to a national bank or Federal savings association if the OCC determines that permitting the institution to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk posed by the institution. When making this determination, the OCC will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the national bank or Federal savings association since December 31, 2019; the causes of this growth, including whether this growth occurred as a result of a merger or acquisition; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the national bank or Federal savings association has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; and the type of assets held by the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC will notify a national bank or Federal savings association of a determination under this paragraph. A national bank or Federal savings association may, not later than 30 days after the date of a determination by the OCC, inform the OCC, in writing, of why the national bank or Federal savings association should be eligible for the temporary relief. The OCC will make a final determination after reviewing any response.

      (b)  A qualifying community banking organization's leverage ratio is calculated in accordance with § 3.10(b)(4), except that a qualifying community banking organization is not required to:

      (1) Make adjustments and deductions from tier 2 capital for purposes of § 3.22(c); or

      (2) Calculate and deduct from tier 1 capital an amount resulting from insufficient tier 2 capital under § 3.22(f).

      (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, if a national bank or Federal savings association ceases to meet the definition of a qualifying community banking organization, the national bank or Federal savings association has two reporting periods under its Call Report (grace period) to either satisfy the requirements to be a qualifying community banking organization or to comply with § 3.10(a)(1) and report the required capital measures under § 3.10(a)(1) on its Call Report.

      (2) The grace period begins as of the end of the calendar quarter in which the national bank or Federal savings association ceases to satisfy the criteria to be a qualifying community banking organization provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The grace period ends on the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter following the beginning of the grace period.

      (3) During the grace period, the national bank or Federal savings association continues to be treated as a qualifying community banking organization for the purpose of this part and must continue calculating and reporting its leverage ratio under this section unless the national bank or Federal savings association has opted out of using the community bank leverage ratio framework under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (4) During the grace period, the qualifying community banking organization continues to be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements under § 3.10(a)(1), the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized capital category under § 6.4(b)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this chapter, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying community banking organization is subject, and must continue calculating and reporting its leverage ratio under this section.

      (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that no longer meets the definition of a qualifying community banking organization as a result of a merger or acquisition has no grace period and immediately ceases to be a qualifying community banking organization. Such a national bank or Federal savings association must comply with the minimum capital requirements under § 3.10(a)(1) and must report the required capital measures under § 3.10(a)(1) for the quarter in which it ceases to be a qualifying community banking organization.

      (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that has a leverage ratio of 8 percent or less does not have a grace period and must comply with the minimum capital requirements under § 3.10(a)(1) and must report the required capital measures under § 3.10(a)(1) for the quarter in which it reports a leverage ratio of 8 percent or less.

    Subpart C—Definition of Capital

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 62157, 62273, Oct. 11, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 3.20   Capital components and eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.

#### § § 3.20

      (a)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's regulatory capital components are:

      (1) Common equity tier 1 capital;

      (2) Additional tier 1 capital; and

      (3) Tier 2 capital.

      (b)  Common equity tier 1 capital is the sum of the common equity tier 1 capital elements in this paragraph (b), minus regulatory adjustments and deductions in § 3.22. The common equity tier 1 capital elements are:

      (1) Any common stock instruments (plus any related surplus) issued by the national bank or Federal savings association, net of treasury stock, and any capital instruments issued by mutual banking organizations, that meet all the following criteria:

      (i) The instrument is paid-in, issued directly by the national bank or Federal savings association, and represents the most subordinated claim in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (ii) The holder of the instrument is entitled to a claim on the residual assets of the national bank or Federal savings association that is proportional with the holder's share of the national bank's or Federal savings association's issued capital after all senior claims have been satisfied in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

      (iii) The instrument has no maturity date, can only be redeemed via discretionary repurchases with the prior approval of the OCC, and does not contain any term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem;

      (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association did not create at issuance of the instrument through any action or communication an expectation that it will buy back, cancel, or redeem the instrument, and the instrument does not include any term or feature that might give rise to such an expectation;

      (v) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the national bank's or Federal savings association's net income or retained earnings and are not subject to a limit imposed by the contractual terms governing the instrument.

      (vi) The national bank or Federal savings association has full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends and making any other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of any other restrictions on the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (vii) Dividend payments and any other distributions on the instrument may be paid only after all legal and contractual obligations of the national bank or Federal savings association have been satisfied, including payments due on more senior claims;

      (viii) The holders of the instrument bear losses as they occur equally, proportionately, and simultaneously with the holders of all other common stock instruments before any losses are borne by holders of claims on the national bank or Federal savings association with greater priority in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

      (ix) The paid-in amount is classified as equity under GAAP;

      (x) The national bank or Federal savings association, or an entity that the national bank or Federal savings association controls, did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument;

      (xi) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the national bank or Federal savings association or of an affiliate of the national bank or Federal savings association, and is not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument;

      (xii) The instrument has been issued in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and

      (xiii) The instrument is reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's regulatory financial statements separately from other capital instruments.

      (2) Retained earnings.

      (3) Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as reported under GAAP.

      (4) Any common equity tier 1 minority interest, subject to the limitations in § 3.21.

      (5) Notwithstanding the criteria for common stock instruments referenced above, a national bank's or Federal savings association's common stock issued and held in trust for the benefit of its employees as part of an employee stock ownership plan does not violate any of the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(iii), paragraph (b)(1)(iv) or paragraph (b)(1)(xi) of this section, provided that any repurchase of the stock is required solely by virtue of ERISA for an instrument of a national bank or Federal savings association that is not publicly-traded. In addition, an instrument issued by a national bank or Federal savings association to its employee stock ownership plan does not violate the criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this section.

      (c)  Additional tier 1 capital is the sum of additional tier 1 capital elements and any related surplus, minus the regulatory adjustments and deductions in § 3.22. Additional tier 1 capital elements are:

      (1) Instruments (plus any related surplus) that meet the following criteria:

      (i) The instrument is issued and paid-in;

      (ii) The instrument is subordinated to depositors, general creditors, and subordinated debt holders of the national bank or Federal savings association in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

      (iii) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the national bank or Federal savings association or of an affiliate of the national bank or Federal savings association, and not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument;

      (iv) The instrument has no maturity date and does not contain a dividend step-up or any other term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem; and

      (v) If callable by its terms, the instrument may be called by the national bank or Federal savings association only after a minimum of five years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a regulatory event that precludes the instrument from being included in additional tier 1 capital, a tax event, or if the issuing entity is required to register as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 ). In addition:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association must receive prior approval from the OCC to exercise a call option on the instrument.

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association does not create at issuance of the instrument, through any action or communication, an expectation that the call option will be exercised.

      (C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the national bank or Federal savings association must either: Replace the instrument to be called with an equal amount of instruments that meet the criteria under paragraph (b) of this section or this paragraph (c);   or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that following redemption, the national bank or Federal savings association will continue to hold capital commensurate with its risk.

      (vi) Redemption or repurchase of the instrument requires prior approval from the OCC.

      (vii) The national bank or Federal savings association has full discretion at all times to cancel dividends or other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of other restrictions on the national bank or Federal savings association except in relation to any distributions to holders of common stock or instruments that are pari passu with the instrument.

      (viii) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the national bank's or Federal savings association's net income or retained earnings.

      (ix) The instrument does not have a credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit quality, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit quality, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments.

      (x) The paid-in amount is classified as equity under GAAP.

      (xi) The national bank or Federal savings association, or an entity that the national bank or Federal savings association controls, did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument.

      (xii) The instrument does not have any features that would limit or discourage additional issuance of capital by the national bank or Federal savings association, such as provisions that require the national bank or Federal savings association to compensate holders of the instrument if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a specified time frame.

      (xiii) If the instrument is not issued directly by the national bank or Federal savings association or by a subsidiary of the national bank or Federal savings association that is an operating entity, the only asset of the issuing entity is its investment in the capital of the national bank or Federal savings association, and proceeds must be immediately available without limitation to the national bank or Federal savings association or to the national bank's or Federal savings association's top-tier holding company in a form which meets or exceeds all of the other criteria for additional tier 1 capital instruments.

      (xiv) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, the governing agreement, offering circular, or prospectus of an instrument issued after the date upon which the national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to this part as set forth in § 3.1(f) must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the national bank or Federal savings association enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

      (2) Tier 1 minority interest, subject to the limitations in § 3.21, that is not included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital.

      (4) Notwithstanding the criteria for additional tier 1 capital instruments referenced above:

      (i) An instrument issued by a national bank or Federal savings association and held in trust for the benefit of its employees as part of an employee stock ownership plan does not violate any of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, provided that any repurchase is required solely by virtue of ERISA for an instrument of a national bank or Federal savings association that is not publicly-traded. In addition, an instrument issued by a national bank or Federal savings association to its employee stock ownership plan does not violate the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(v) or paragraph (c)(1)(xi) of this section; and

      (ii) An instrument with terms that provide that the instrument may be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a rating agency event does not violate the criterion in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section provided that the instrument was issued and included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital prior to January 1, 2014, and that such instrument satisfies all other criteria under this § 3.20(c).

      (d)  Tier 2 capital is the sum of tier 2 capital elements and any related surplus, minus regulatory adjustments and deductions in § 3.22. Tier 2 capital elements are:

      (iv) The instrument has a minimum original maturity of at least five years. At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included in tier 2 capital is reduced by 20 percent of the original amount of the instrument (net of redemptions) and is excluded from regulatory capital when the remaining maturity is less than one year. In addition, the instrument must not have any terms or features that require, or create significant incentives for, the national bank or Federal savings association to redeem the instrument prior to maturity;   and

      (v) The instrument, by its terms, may be called by the national bank or Federal savings association only after a minimum of five years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called sooner upon the occurrence of an event that would preclude the instrument from being included in tier 2 capital, a tax event, or if the issuing entity is required to register as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 ). In addition:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association must receive the prior approval of the OCC to exercise a call option on the instrument.

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association does not create at issuance, through action or communication, an expectation the call option will be exercised.

      (C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the national bank or Federal savings association must either: Replace any amount called with an equivalent amount of an instrument that meets the criteria for regulatory capital under this section;   or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that following redemption, the national bank or Federal savings association would continue to hold an amount of capital that is commensurate with its risk.

      (vi) The holder of the instrument must have no contractual right to accelerate payment of principal or interest on the instrument, except in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (vii) The instrument has no credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend or interest rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit standing, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit standing, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments.

      (viii) The national bank or Federal savings association, or an entity that the national bank or Federal savings association controls, has not purchased and has not directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.

      (ix) If the instrument is not issued directly by the national bank or Federal savings association or by a subsidiary of the national bank or Federal savings association that is an operating entity, the only asset of the issuing entity is its investment in the capital of the national bank or Federal savings association, and proceeds must be immediately available without limitation to the national bank or Federal savings association or the national bank's or Federal savings association's top-tier holding company in a form that meets or exceeds all the other criteria for tier 2 capital instruments under this section.

      (x) Redemption of the instrument prior to maturity or repurchase requires the prior approval of the OCC.

      (xi) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, the governing agreement, offering circular, or prospectus of an instrument issued after the date on which the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to this part under § 3.1(f) must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the national bank or Federal savings association enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

      (2) Total capital minority interest, subject to the limitations set forth in § 3.21, that is not included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital.

      (3) ALLL or AACL, as applicable, up to 1.25 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's standardized total risk-weighted assets not including any amount of the ALLL or AACL, as applicable (and excluding in the case of a market risk national bank or Federal savings association, its standardized market risk-weighted assets).

      (4)(i) Any instrument that qualified as tier 2 capital under the OCC's general risk-based capital rules under appendix A to this part, 12 CFR part 167 as then in effect, that were issued under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010,  or prior to October 4, 2010, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

      (ii) Any debt instruments issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Emergency Capital Investment Program pursuant to section 104A of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

      (5) For a national bank or Federal savings association that makes an AOCI opt-out election (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of § 3.22), 45 percent of pretax net unrealized gains on available-for-sale preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP and available-for-sale equity exposures.

      (6) Notwithstanding the criteria for tier 2 capital instruments referenced above, an instrument with terms that provide that the instrument may be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a rating agency event does not violate the criterion in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section provided that the instrument was issued and included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to January 1, 2014, and that such instrument satisfies all other criteria under this paragraph (d).

      (e)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must receive OCC prior approval to include a capital element (as listed in this section) in its common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital unless the element:

      (i) Was included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in accordance with the OCC's risk-based capital rules that were effective as of that date and the underlying instrument may continue to be included under the criteria set forth in this section; or

      (ii) Is equivalent, in terms of capital quality and ability to absorb losses with respect to all material terms, to a regulatory capital element the OCC determined may be included in regulatory capital pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (2) When considering whether a national bank or Federal savings association may include a regulatory capital element in its common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, the OCC will consult with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board.

      (3) After determining that a regulatory capital element may be included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, the OCC will make its decision publicly available, including a brief description of the material terms of the regulatory capital element and the rationale for the determination.

      § 3.22   Regulatory capital adjustments and deductions.

#### § § 3.22

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from the sum of its common equity tier 1 capital elements the items set forth in this paragraph (a):

      (1)(i) Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; and

      (ii) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, goodwill that is embedded in the valuation of a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock (and that is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association), in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;

      (2) Intangible assets, other than MSAs, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

      (3) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

      (4) Any gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure;

      (5)(i) Any defined benefit pension fund net asset, net of any associated DTL in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, held by a depository institution holding company. With the prior approval of the OCC, this deduction is not required for any defined benefit pension fund net asset to the extent the depository institution holding company has unrestricted and unfettered access to the assets in that fund.

      (ii) For an insured depository institution, no deduction is required.

      (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight any portion of the defined benefit pension fund asset that is not deducted under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section as if the national bank or Federal savings association directly holds a proportional ownership share of each exposure in the defined benefit pension fund.

      (6) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d), the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds its eligible credit reserves; and

      (7) With respect to a financial subsidiary, the aggregate amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's outstanding equity investment, including retained earnings, in its financial subsidiaries (as defined in [12 CFR 5.39 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.77 (Board))]. A national bank or Federal savings association must not consolidate the assets and liabilities of a financial subsidiary with those of the parent bank, and no other deduction is required under paragraph (c) of this section for investments in the capital instruments of financial subsidiaries.

      (8)(i) A Federal savings association must deduct the aggregate amount of its outstanding investments (both equity and debt) in, and extensions of credit to, subsidiaries that are not includable subsidiaries as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section and may not consolidate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary with those of the Federal savings association. Any such deductions shall be deducted from assets and common equity tier 1 except as provided in paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      (ii) If a Federal savings association has any investments (both debt and equity) in, or extensions or credit to, one or more subsidiaries engaged in any activity that would not fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section may engage, it must deduct such investments and extensions of credit from assets and, thus, common equity tier 1 in accordance with paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section.

      (iii) If a Federal savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, the OCC may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount of common equity tier 1 that would be required would be higher if the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the parent Federal savings association than the amount that would be required if the parent Federal savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section, consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent Federal savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent Federal savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section.

      (iv) For purposes of this section, the term includable subsidiary means a subsidiary of a Federal savings association that:

      (A) Is engaged solely in activities not impermissible for a national bank;

      (B) Is engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank, but only if acting solely as agent for its customers and such agency position is clearly documented in the Federal savings association's files;

      (C) Is engaged solely in mortgage-banking activities;

      (D)() Is itself an insured depository institution or a company the sole investment of which is an insured depository institution; and

      () Was acquired by the parent Federal savings association prior to May 1, 1989; or

      (E) Was a subsidiary of any Federal savings association existing as a Federal savings association on August 9, 1989:

      () That was chartered prior to October _1_5, 1982, as a savings bank or a cooperative bank under state law; or

      () That acquired its principal assets from an association that was chartered prior to October 15, 198_2_, as a savings bank or a cooperative bank under state law.

      (b)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the sum of common equity tier 1 capital elements pursuant to the requirements set forth in this paragraph (b). Such adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital must be made net of the associated deferred tax effects.

      (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that makes an AOCI opt-out election (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), must make the adjustments required under § 3.22(b)(2)(i).

      (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, and a national bank or Federal savings association that has not made an AOCI opt-out election (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), must deduct any accumulated net gains and add any accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

      (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct any net gain and add any net loss related to changes in the fair value of liabilities that are due to changes in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own credit risk. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct the difference between its credit spread premium and the risk-free rate for derivatives that are liabilities as part of this adjustment.

      (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may make a one-time election to opt out of the requirement to include all components of AOCI (with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not fair-valued on the balance sheet) in common equity tier 1 capital (AOCI opt-out election). A national bank or Federal savings association that makes an AOCI opt-out election in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2) must adjust common equity tier 1 capital as follows:

      (A) Subtract any net unrealized gains and add any net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities;

      (B) Subtract any net unrealized losses on available-for-sale preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP and available-for-sale equity exposures;

      (C) Subtract any accumulated net gains and add any accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges;

      (D) Subtract any amounts recorded in AOCI attributed to defined benefit postretirement plans resulting from the initial and subsequent application of the relevant GAAP standards that pertain to such plans (excluding, at the national bank's or Federal savings association's option, the portion relating to pension assets deducted under paragraph (a)(5) of this section); and

      (E) Subtract any net unrealized gains and add any net unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities that are included in AOCI.

      (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must make its AOCI opt-out election in the Call Report:

      (A) If the national bank or Federal savings association is a Category III national bank or Federal savings association, during the first reporting period after the national bank or Federal savings association meets the definition of a Category III national bank or Federal savings association in § 3.2; or

      (B) If the national bank or Federal savings association is not a Category III national bank or Federal savings association, during the first reporting period after the national bank or Federal savings association is required to comply with subpart A of this part as set forth in § 3.1(f).

      (iii) With respect to a national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, each of its subsidiary banking organizations that is subject to regulatory capital requirements issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency   must elect the same option as the national bank or Federal savings association pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2).

      (iv) With prior notice to the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association resulting from a merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction and that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may change its AOCI opt-out election in its Call Report filed for the first reporting period after the date required for such national bank or Federal savings association to comply with subpart A of this part as set forth in § 3.1(f) if:

      (A) Other than as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, the merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction involved the acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of either the assets or voting stock of another banking organization that is subject to regulatory capital requirements issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;

      (B) Prior to the merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction, only one of the banking organizations involved in the transaction made an AOCI opt-out election under this section; and

      (C) A national bank or Federal savings association may, with the prior approval of the OCC, change its AOCI opt-out election under this paragraph (b) in the case of a merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction that meets the requirements set forth at paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, but does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A). In making such a determination, the OCC may consider the terms of the merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction, as well as the extent of any changes to the risk profile, complexity, and scope of operations of the national bank or Federal savings association resulting from the merger, acquisition, or purchase transaction.

      (c)   —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instruments, as follows:

      (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own common stock instruments from its common equity tier 1 capital elements to the extent such instruments are not excluded from regulatory capital under § 3.20(b)(1);

      (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own additional tier 1 capital instruments from its additional tier 1 capital elements; and

      (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own tier 2 capital instruments from its tier 2 capital elements.

      (2)  For purposes of subpart C of this part, the corresponding deduction approach is the methodology used for the deductions from regulatory capital related to reciprocal cross holdings (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section), investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions for a national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association (as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions for an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), and non-common stock significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions for an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association (as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section). Under the corresponding deduction approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must make deductions from the component of capital for which the underlying instrument would qualify if it were issued by the national bank or Federal savings association itself, as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the national bank or Federal savings association does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must be deducted according to paragraph (f) of this section.

      (i) If an investment is in the form of an instrument issued by a financial institution that is not a regulated financial institution, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the instrument as:

      (A) A common equity tier 1 capital instrument if it is common stock or represents the most subordinated claim in a liquidation of the financial institution; and

      (B) An additional tier 1 capital instrument if it is subordinated to all creditors of the financial institution and is senior in liquidation only to common shareholders.

      (ii) If an investment is in the form of an instrument issued by a regulated financial institution and the instrument does not meet the criteria for common equity tier 1, additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments under § 3.20, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the instrument as:

      (A) A common equity tier 1 capital instrument if it is common stock included in GAAP equity or represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the financial institution;

      (B) An additional tier 1 capital instrument if it is included in GAAP equity, subordinated to all creditors of the financial institution, and senior in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding only to common shareholders;

      (C) A tier 2 capital instrument if it is not included in GAAP equity but considered regulatory capital by the primary supervisor of the financial institution; and

      (D) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, a tier 2 capital instrument if it is a covered debt instrument.

      (iii) If an investment is in the form of a non-qualifying capital instrument (as defined in § 3.300(c)), the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the instrument as:

      (A) An additional tier 1 capital instrument if such instrument was included in the issuer's tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010; or

      (B) A tier 2 capital instrument if such instrument was included in the issuer's tier 2 capital (but not includable in tier 1 capital) prior to May 19, 2010.

      (3)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in the capital of other financial institutions that it holds reciprocally with another financial institution, where such reciprocal cross holdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital instruments, by applying the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (ii) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct an investment in any covered debt instrument that the institution holds reciprocally with another financial institution, where such reciprocal cross holdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital or covered debt instruments, by applying the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (4)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct its investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (as defined in § 3.2) that exceed 25 percent of the sum of the national bank or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements minus all deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section by applying the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  The deductions described in this section are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, with the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association that underwrites a failed underwriting, for the period of time stipulated by the OCC, is not required to deduct an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution pursuant to this paragraph (c) to the extent the investment is related to the failed underwriting.

      (5)  (i) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct its non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (as defined in § 3.2) that, in the aggregate and together with any investment in a covered debt instrument (as defined in § 3.2) issued by a financial institution in which the national bank or Federal savings association does not have a significant investment in the capital of the unconsolidated financial institution (as defined in § 3.2), exceeds 10 percent of the sum of the advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements minus all deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section (the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments) by applying the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  The deductions described in this paragraph are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, with the prior written approval of the OCC, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that underwrites a failed underwriting, for the period of time stipulated by the OCC, is not required to deduct from capital a non-significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution or an investment in a covered debt instrument pursuant to this paragraph (c)(5) to the extent the investment is related to the failed underwriting.  For any calculation under this paragraph (c)(5)(i), an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may exclude the amount of an investment in a covered debt instrument under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) or (iv) of this section, as applicable.

      (ii) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, the amount to be deducted under this paragraph (c)(5) from a specific capital component is equal to:

      (A) The advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate non-significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution and, if applicable, any investments in a covered debt instrument subject to deduction under this paragraph (c)(5), exceeding the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments, multiplied by

      (B) The ratio of the advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate non-significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution (in the form of such capital component) to the national bank's or Federal savings association's total non-significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, with an investment in a covered debt instrument being treated as tier 2 capital for this purpose.

      (iii) For purposes of applying the deduction under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that is not a subsidiary of a global systemically important banking organization, as defined in 12 CFR 252.2, may exclude from the deduction the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's gross long position, in accordance with § 3.22(h)(2), in investments in covered debt instruments issued by financial institutions in which the national bank or Federal savings association does not have a significant investment in the capital of the unconsolidated financial institutions up to an amount equal to 5 percent of the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements minus all deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (iv) Prior to applying the deduction under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section:

      (A) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as defined in 12 CFR 252.2, may designate any investment in a covered debt instrument as an excluded covered debt instrument, as defined in § 3.2.

      (B) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as defined in 12 CFR 252.2, must deduct according to the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, its gross long position, calculated in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, in a covered debt instrument that was originally designated as an excluded covered debt instrument, in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, but no longer qualifies as an excluded covered debt instrument.

      (C) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as defined in 12 CFR 252.2, must deduct according to the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the amount of its gross long position, calculated in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, in a direct or indirect investment in a covered debt instrument that was originally designated as an excluded covered debt instrument, in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, and has been held for more than thirty business days.

      (D) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as defined in 12 CFR 252.2, must deduct according to the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section its gross long position, calculated in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, of its aggregate investment in excluded covered debt instruments that exceeds 5 percent of the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements minus all deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (6)  If an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association has a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from capital any such investment issued by the unconsolidated financial institution that is held by the national bank or Federal savings association other than an investment in the form of common stock, as well as any investment in a covered debt instrument issued by the unconsolidated financial institution, by applying the corresponding deduction approach in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  The deductions described in this section are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, with the prior written approval of the OCC, for the period of time stipulated by the OCC, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that underwrites a failed underwriting is not required to deduct the significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution or an investment in a covered debt instrument pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6) if such investment is related to such failed underwriting.

      (d)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must make deductions from regulatory capital as described in this paragraph (d)(1).

      (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the amount of each of the items set forth in this paragraph (d)(1) that, individually, exceeds 25 percent of the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements, less adjustments to and deductions from common equity tier 1 capital required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section (the 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold).

      (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the amount of DTAs arising from temporary differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. A national bank or Federal savings association is not required to deduct from the sum of its common equity tier 1 capital elements DTAs (net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs, in accordance with § 3.22(e)) arising from timing differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could realize through net operating loss carrybacks. The national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight these assets at 100 percent. For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a member of a consolidated group for tax purposes, the amount of DTAs that could be realized through net operating loss carrybacks may not exceed the amount that the national bank or Federal savings association could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent holding company.

      (iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the amount of MSAs net of associated DTLs, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (iv) For purposes of calculating the amount of DTAs subject to deduction pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may exclude DTAs and DTLs relating to adjustments made to common equity tier 1 capital under paragraph (b) of this section. A national bank or Federal savings association that elects to exclude DTAs relating to adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section also must exclude DTLs and must do so consistently in all future calculations. A national bank or Federal savings association may change its exclusion preference only after obtaining the prior approval of the OCC.

      (2) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must make deductions from regulatory capital as described in this paragraph (d)(2).

      (i) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the amount of each of the items set forth in this paragraph (d)(2) that, individually, exceeds 10 percent of the sum of the advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements, less adjustments to and deductions from common equity tier 1 capital required under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section (the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold).

      (A) DTAs arising from temporary differences that the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association is not required to deduct from the sum of its common equity tier 1 capital elements DTAs (net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs, in accordance with § 3.22(e)) arising from timing differences that the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association could realize through net operating loss carrybacks. The advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight these assets at 100 percent. For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a member of a consolidated group for tax purposes, the amount of DTAs that could be realized through net operating loss carrybacks may not exceed the amount that the national bank or Federal savings association could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent holding company.

      (B) MSAs net of associated DTLs, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (C) Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.  Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock subject to the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold may be reduced by any goodwill embedded in the valuation of such investments deducted by the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, with the prior written approval of the OCC, for the period of time stipulated by the OCC, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that underwrites a failed underwriting is not required to deduct a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2) if such investment is related to such failed underwriting.

      (ii) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the items listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that are not deducted as a result of the application of the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold, and that, in aggregate, exceed 17.65 percent of the sum of the advanced approaches national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital elements, minus adjustments to and deductions from common equity tier 1 capital required under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, minus the items listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section (the 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold). Any goodwill that has been deducted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section can be excluded from the significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock.

      (iii) For purposes of calculating the amount of DTAs subject to the 10 and 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction thresholds, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may exclude DTAs and DTLs relating to adjustments made to common equity tier 1 capital under paragraph (b) of this section. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that elects to exclude DTAs relating to adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section also must exclude DTLs and must do so consistently in all future calculations. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may change its exclusion preference only after obtaining the prior approval of the OCC.

      (e)  (1) Except as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, netting of DTLs against assets that are subject to deduction under this section is permitted, but not required, if the following conditions are met:

      (i) The DTL is associated with the asset; and

      (ii) The DTL would be extinguished if the associated asset becomes impaired or is derecognized under GAAP.

      (2) A DTL may only be netted against a single asset.

      (3) For purposes of calculating the amount of DTAs subject to the threshold deduction in paragraph (d) of this section, the amount of DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances, and of DTAs arising from temporary differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances, may be offset by DTLs (that have not been netted against assets subject to deduction pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section) subject to the conditions set forth in this paragraph (e).

      (i) Only the DTAs and DTLs that relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and that are eligible for offsetting by that authority may be offset for purposes of this deduction.

      (ii) The amount of DTLs that the national bank or Federal savings association nets against DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances, and against DTAs arising from temporary differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances, must be allocated in proportion to the amount of DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuation allowances, but before any offsetting of DTLs) and of DTAs arising from temporary differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks (net of any related valuation allowances, but before any offsetting of DTLs), respectively.

      (4) A national bank or Federal savings association may offset DTLs embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease portfolio acquired in a business combination that are not recognized under GAAP against DTAs that are subject to paragraph (d) of this section in accordance with this paragraph (e).

      (5) A national bank or Federal savings association must net DTLs against assets subject to deduction under this section in a consistent manner from reporting period to reporting period. A national bank or Federal savings association may change its preference regarding the manner in which it nets DTLs against specific assets subject to deduction under this section only after obtaining the prior approval of the OCC.

      (f)  Under the corresponding deduction approach, if a national bank or Federal savings association does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the full amount of any deduction from capital required under paragraph (d) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must deduct the shortfall amount from the next higher (that is, more subordinated) component of regulatory capital. Any investment by an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association in a covered debt instrument must be treated as an investment in the tier 2 capital for purposes of this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a qualifying community banking organization (as defined in § 3.12) that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework pursuant to § 3.12 is not required to deduct any shortfall of tier 2 capital from its additional tier 1 capital or common equity tier 1 capital.

      (g)  A national bank or Federal savings association must exclude from standardized total risk-weighted assets and, as applicable, advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets any item that is required to be deducted from regulatory capital.

      (h) —(1)  For purposes of calculating the amount of a national bank's or Federal savings association's investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instrument, investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, and investment in a covered debt instrument under this section, the institution's net long position is the gross long position in the underlying instrument determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, as adjusted to recognize any short position by the national bank or Federal savings association in the same instrument subject to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

      (2)  A gross long position is determined as follows:

      (i) For an equity exposure that is held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association, the adjusted carrying value of the exposure as that term is defined in § 3.51(b);

      (ii) For an exposure that is held directly and that is not an equity exposure or a securitization exposure, the exposure amount as that term is defined in § 3.2;

      (iii) For each indirect exposure, the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of its investment in an investment fund or, alternatively:

      (A) A national bank or Federal savings association may, with the prior approval of the OCC, use a conservative estimate of the amount of its indirect investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instruments, its indirect investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, or its indirect investment in a covered debt instrument held through a position in an index, as applicable; or

      (B) A national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the gross long position for an indirect exposure to the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital the capital in an unconsolidated financial institution, or a covered debt instrument by multiplying the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of its investment in the investment fund by either:

      () The highest stated investment limit (in percent) for an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instruments, an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, or an investment in a covered debt instrument, as applicable, as stated in the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract defining permissible investments of the investment fund; or

      () The investment fund's actual holdings (in percent) of the investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instruments, investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, or investment in a covered debt instrument, as applicable; and

      (iv) For a synthetic exposure, the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's loss on the exposure if the reference capital instrument or covered debt instrument were to have a value of zero.

      (3)  In order to adjust the gross long position to recognize a short position in the same instrument under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the following criteria must be met:

      (i) The maturity of the short position must match the maturity of the long position, or the short position must have a residual maturity of at least one year (maturity requirement); or

      (ii) For a position that is a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report, if the national bank or Federal savings association has a contractual right or obligation to sell the long position at a specific point in time and the counterparty to the contract has an obligation to purchase the long position if the national bank or Federal savings association exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated as the maturity of the long position such that the maturity of the long position and short position are deemed to match for purposes of the maturity requirement, even if the maturity of the short position is less than one year; and

      (iii) For an investment in a national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instrument under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution under paragraphs (c)(4) through (6) and (d) of this section (as applicable), and an investment in a covered debt instrument under paragraphs (c)(1), (5), and (6) of this section:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association may only net a short position against a long position in an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instrument under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the short position involves no counterparty credit risk;

      (B) A gross long position in an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instrument, an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution, or an investment in a covered debt instrument due to a position in an index may be netted against a short position in the same index;

      (C) Long and short positions in the same index without maturity dates are considered to have matching maturities; and

      (D) A short position in an index that is hedging a long cash or synthetic position in an investment in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own capital instrument, an investment in the capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution, or an investment in a covered debt instrument can be decomposed to provide recognition of the hedge. More specifically, the portion of the index that is composed of the same underlying instrument that is being hedged may be used to offset the long position if both the long position being hedged and the short position in the index are reported as a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet) on the national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report, and the hedge is deemed effective by the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal control processes, which have not been found to be inadequate by the OCC.

      Risk-Weighted Assets For General Credit Risk

        § 3.31   Mechanics for calculating risk-weighted assets for general credit risk.

#### § § 3.31

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must apply risk weights to its exposures as follows:

        (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of each on-balance sheet exposure, each OTC derivative contract, and each off-balance sheet commitment, trade and transaction-related contingency, guarantee, repo-style transaction, financial standby letter of credit, forward agreement, or other similar transaction that is not:

        (i) An unsettled transaction subject to § 3.38;

        (ii) A cleared transaction subject to § 3.35;

        (iii) A default fund contribution subject to § 3.35;

        (iv) A securitization exposure subject to §§ 3.41 through 3.45; or

        (v) An equity exposure (other than an equity OTC derivative contract) subject to §§ 3.51 through 3.53.

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must multiply each exposure amount by the risk weight appropriate to the exposure based on the exposure type or counterparty, eligible guarantor, or financial collateral to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure.

        (b) Total risk-weighted assets for general credit risk equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts calculated under this section.

        § 3.32   General risk weights.

#### § § 3.32

        (a) —(1)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirement in this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a zero percent risk weight to:

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a zero percent risk weight to a Paycheck Protection Program covered loan as defined in section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)).

        (2)  In accordance with Table 1 to § 3.32, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight to a sovereign exposure based on the CRC applicable to the sovereign or the sovereign's OECD membership status if there is no CRC applicable to the sovereign.

        (3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign to a sovereign exposure a risk weight that is lower than the applicable risk weight in Table 1 to § 3.32 if:

        (i) The exposure is denominated in the sovereign's currency;

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association has at least an equivalent amount of liabilities in that currency; and

        (iii) The risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that the home country supervisor allows national banks or Federal savings associations under its jurisdiction to assign to the same exposures to the sovereign.

        (4)  Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 100 percent risk weight to an exposure to a sovereign if the sovereign does not have a CRC.

        (5)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 0 percent risk weight to an exposure to a sovereign that is a member of the OECD if the sovereign does not have a CRC.

        (6)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 150 percent risk weight to a sovereign exposure immediately upon determining that an event of sovereign default has occurred, or if an event of sovereign default has occurred during the previous five years.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a zero percent risk weight to an exposure to the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, or an MDB.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 100 percent risk weight to preferred stock issued by a GSE.

        (d) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 20 percent risk weight to an exposure to a depository institution or credit union that is organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, except as otherwise provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (2)  (i) Except as otherwise provided under paragraphs (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(v), and (d)(3) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank, in accordance with Table 2 to § 3.32, based on the CRC that corresponds to the foreign bank's home country or the OECD membership status of the foreign bank's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the foreign bank's home country.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 20 percent risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank whose home country is a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 20 percent risk-weight to an exposure that is a self-liquidating, trade-related contingent item that arises from the movement of goods and that has a maturity of three months or less to a foreign bank whose home country has a CRC of 0, 1, 2, or 3, or is an OECD member with no CRC.

        (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 100 percent risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank whose home country is not a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC, with the exception of self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods, and that have a maturity of three months or less, which may be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a lower risk weight than would otherwise apply under Tables 3 or 4 to § 3.32 to an exposure to a foreign PSE if:

        (i) The PSE's home country supervisor allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign a lower risk weight to such exposures; and

        (ii) The risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that corresponds to the PSE's home country in accordance with Table 1 to § 3.32.

        § 3.33   Off-balance sheet exposures.

#### § § 3.33

        (a)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet exposure using the credit conversion factors (CCFs) in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) Where a national bank or Federal savings association commits to provide a commitment, the national bank or Federal savings association may apply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.

        (3) Where a national bank or Federal savings association provides a commitment structured as a syndication or participation, the national bank or Federal savings association is only required to calculate the exposure amount for its pro rata share of the commitment.

        (4) Where a national bank or Federal savings association provides a commitment, enters into a repurchase agreement, or provides a credit-enhancing representation and warranty, and such commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty is not a securitization exposure, the exposure amount shall be no greater than the maximum contractual amount of the commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty, as applicable.

        (b) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a zero percent CCF to the unused portion of a commitment that is unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association.

        (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 20 percent CCF to the amount of:

        (i) Commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association; and

        (ii) Self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods, with an original maturity of one year or less.

        (3)  A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 50 percent CCF to the amount of:

        (i) Commitments with an original maturity of more than one year that are not unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association; and

        (ii) Transaction-related contingent items, including performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, and performance standby letters of credit.

        (4)  A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 100 percent CCF to the amount of the following off-balance-sheet items and other similar transactions:

        (i) Guarantees;

        (ii) Repurchase agreements (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the national bank or Federal savings association has sold subject to repurchase);

        (iii) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties that are not securitization exposures;

        (iv) Off-balance sheet securities lending transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the national bank or Federal savings association has lent under the transaction);

        (v) Off-balance sheet securities borrowing transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all non-cash positions the national bank or Federal savings association has posted as collateral under the transaction);

        (vi) Financial standby letters of credit; and

        (vii) Forward agreements.

        § 3.34   Derivative contracts.

#### § § 3.34

        (a) —(1)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must use the current exposure methodology (CEM) described in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate the exposure amount for all its OTC derivative contracts, unless the national bank or Federal savings association makes the election provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may elect to calculate the exposure amount for all its OTC derivative contracts under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) in § 3.132(c) by notifying the OCC, rather than calculating the exposure amount for all its derivative contracts using CEM. A national bank or Federal savings association that elects under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) to calculate the exposure amount for its OTC derivative contracts under SA-CCR must apply the treatment of cleared transactions under § 3.133 to its derivative contracts that are cleared transactions and to all default fund contributions associated with such derivative contracts, rather than applying § 3.35. A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must use the same methodology to calculate the exposure amount for all its derivative contracts and, if a national bank or Federal savings association has elected to use SA-CCR under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), the national bank or Federal savings association may change its election only with prior approval of the OCC.

        (2)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the exposure amount for all its derivative contracts using SA-CCR in § 3.132(c) for purposes of standardized total risk-weighted assets. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must apply the treatment of cleared transactions under § 3.133 to its derivative contracts that are cleared transactions and to all default fund contributions associated with such derivative contracts for purposes of standardized total risk-weighted assets.

        (b) —(1)  Except as modified by paragraph (c) of this section, the exposure amount for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the OTC derivative contract.

        (i)  The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the fair value of the OTC derivative contract or zero.

        (ii)  (A) The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the OTC derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 to this section.

        (B) For purposes of calculating either the PFE under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or the gross PFE under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency.

        (C) For an OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 1 to this section, the PFE must be calculated using the appropriate “other” conversion factor.

        (D) A national bank or Federal savings association must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE.

        (E) The PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.

        (2)  Except as modified by paragraph (c) of this section, the exposure amount for multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE amounts for all OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.

        (i)  The net current credit exposure is the greater of the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of the individual OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement or zero.

        (ii)  The adjusted sum of the PFE amounts, Anet, is calculated as Anet = (0.4 × Agross) + (0.6 × NGR × Agross), where:

        (A) Agross = the gross PFE (that is, the sum of the PFE amounts as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for each individual derivative contract subject to the qualifying master netting agreement); and

        (B) Net-to-gross Ratio (NGR) = the ratio of the net current credit exposure to the gross current credit exposure. In calculating the NGR, the gross current credit exposure equals the sum of the positive current credit exposures (as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) of all individual derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.

        (c)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association using CEM under paragraph (b) of this section may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by using the simple approach in § 3.37(b).

        (2) As an alternative to the simple approach, a national bank or Federal savings association using CEM under paragraph (b) of this section may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set if the financial collateral is marked-to-fair value on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by applying a risk weight to the uncollateralized portion of the exposure, after adjusting the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section using the collateral haircut approach in § 3.37(c). The national bank or Federal savings association must substitute the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for ΣE in the equation in § 3.37(c)(2).

        (d) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under § 3.36 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this subpart provided that the national bank or Federal savings association does so consistently for all such credit derivatives. The national bank or Federal savings association must either include all or exclude all such credit derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.

        (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that is the protection provider under a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as an exposure to the underlying reference asset. The national bank or Federal savings association is not required to compute a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this subpart, provided that this treatment is applied consistently for all such credit derivatives. The national bank or Federal savings association must either include all or exclude all such credit derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.

        (ii) The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) apply to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the national bank or Federal savings association must compute a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section.

        (e)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 3.51 through 3.53 (unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part).

        (2) In addition, the national bank or Federal savings association must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section if the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part.

        (3) If the national bank or Federal savings association risk weights the contract under the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 3.52, the national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of the equity derivative contract, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a national bank or Federal savings association using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.

        (f)  The exposure amount of a clearing member national bank or Federal savings association using CEM under paragraph (b) of this section for a client-facing derivative transaction or netting set of client-facing derivative transactions equals the exposure amount calculated according to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section multiplied by the scaling factor of the square root of   (which equals 0.707107). If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a longer period is appropriate, the national bank or Federal savings association must use a larger scaling factor to adjust for a longer holding period as follows:

        (B) 4 percent if the requirements of § 3.35(b)(3)(A) are not met.

        (ii) For a cleared transaction with a CCP that is not a QCCP, a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association must apply the risk weight appropriate for the CCP according to this subpart D.

        (4)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirements in this section, collateral posted by a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association that is held by a custodian (in its capacity as custodian) in a manner that is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, clearing member, and other clearing member clients of the clearing member, is not subject to a capital requirement under this section.

        (ii) A clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member, or custodian in connection with a cleared transaction in accordance with the requirements under this subpart D.

        () For option derivative contracts that are cleared transactions, the PFE described in § 3.34(a)(1)(ii) must be adjusted by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 to § 3.34 and the absolute value of the option's delta, that is, the ratio of the change in the value of the derivative contract to the corresponding change in the price of the underlying asset.

        () For repo-style transactions, when applying § _3_.37(c)(2), the national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodology in § 3.37(c)(3);

        (B) VM = any collateral posted by clear*i*ng member i to the QCCP that it is entitled to receive from the QCCP, but has not yet received, and any collateral that the QCCP has actually received from clearing member i;

        (C) IM = the collateral posted as *i*nitial margin by clearing member i to the QCCP;

        (D) DF = the funded port*i*on of clearing member i's default fund contribution that will be applied to reduce the QCCP's loss upon a default by clearing member i;

        (E) RW = 20 percent, except when the OCC has determined that a higher risk weight is more appropriate based on the specific characteristics of the QCCP and its clearing members; and

        (F) Where a Q**CCP** has provided its K, a national bank or Federal savings association must rely on such disclosed figure instead of calculating K under this paragraph (d), unless the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a more conservative figure is appropriate based on the nature, structure, or characteristics of the QCCP.

        (ii) For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member of a QCCP with a default fund supported by funded commitments, K equals:

        Subscripts 1 and 2 denote the clearing members with the two largest A values. For purposes of this paragraph (d), for derivatives A is defined in § 3.34(a)(2)(ii) and for repo-style transactions, A means the exposure amount as defined in § 3.37(c)(2) using the methodology in § 3.37(c)(3);

        (B) N = the number of clearing members in the QCCP;

        (C) DF = the Q*CCP*'s own funds and other financial resources that would be used to cover its losses before clearing members' default fund contributions are used to cover losses;

        (D) DF = funded default fund contributions from all clearing members and any other clearing member contributed financial resources that are available to absorb mutualized QCCP losses;

        (E) DF = DF + DF (that is, the total funded default fund contribution);

        () DF = the nat*i*onal bank's or Federal savings association's unfunded commitment to the default fund;

        () DF = the total of all clearing members' unfunded commitment to the default fund; and

        ()  as defined in paragraph (d)(_3_)(ii) of this section.

        (B) For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member of a QCCP with a default fund supported by unfunded commitments and is unable to calculate K using the methodology described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, K equals:

        () IM = the nat*i*onal bank's or Federal savings association's initial margin posted to the QCCP;

        () IM = the total of initial margin posted to the QCCP; and

        () as defined in paragraph (d)(_3_)(ii) of this section.

        (iv)  A clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for its default fund contribution to a QCCP, RWA, equals:

        (A) TE = the national bank's or Federal savings association's trade exposure amount to the QCCP, calculated according to section 35(c)(2);

        (B) DF = the funded portion of the national bank's or Federal savings association's default fund contribution to the QCCP.

        (4)  Total risk-weighted assets for default fund contributions is the sum of a clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted assets for all of its default fund contributions to all CCPs of which the national bank or Federal savings association is a clearing member.

        § 3.36   Guarantees and credit derivatives: substitution treatment.

#### § § 3.36

        (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to an exposure, as provided under this section.

        (2) This section applies to exposures for which:

        (i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or

        (ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the national bank or Federal savings association and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.

        (3) Exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) generally are securitization exposures subject to §§ 3.41 through 3.45.

        (4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:

        (i) The reference exposure ranks  with, or is subordinated to, the hedged exposure; and

        (ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to ensure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligated party of the hedged exposure fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.

        (c) —(1)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure by substituting the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider under this subpart D for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.

        (2)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.

        (i) The national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the protected exposure under this subpart D, where the applicable risk weight is the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the unprotected exposure under this subpart D, where the applicable risk weight is that of the unprotected portion of the hedged exposure.

        (iii) The treatment provided in this section is applicable when the credit risk of an exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis and may be applicable when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.

        (d)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.

        (2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).

        (3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligated party of the hedged exposure is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the hedged exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the national bank or Federal savings association to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.

        (4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.

        (5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant: Pm = E × (t − 0.25) / (T − 0.25), where:

        (i) Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;

        (ii) E = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant;

        (iii) t = the lesser of T or the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant, expressed in years; and

        (iv) T = the lesser of five or the residual maturity of the hedged exposure, expressed in years.

        (e)  If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit derivative: Pr = Pm × 0.60, where:

        (1) Pr = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for lack of restructuring event (and maturity mismatch, if applicable); and

        (2) Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch, if applicable).

        (f)  (1) If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative: Pc = Pr × (1−H), where:

        (i) Pc = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);

        (ii) Pr = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and

        (iii) H = haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must set H equal to eight percent unless it qualifies for the use of and uses its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility based on a ten-business-day holding period. A national bank or Federal savings association qualifies for the use of its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility if it qualifies for the use of its own-estimates haircuts in § 3.37(c)(4).

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust H calculated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section upward if the national bank or Federal savings association revalues the guarantee or credit derivative less frequently than once every 10 business days using the following square root of time formula:

        § 3.37   Collateralized transactions.

#### § § 3.37

        (a)  (1) To recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral, a national bank or Federal savings association may use:

        (i) The simple approach in paragraph (b) of this section for any exposure; or

        (ii) The collateral haircut approach in paragraph (c) of this section for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized derivative contracts, and single-product netting sets of such transactions.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association may use any approach described in this section that is valid for a particular type of exposure or transaction; however, it must use the same approach for similar exposures or transactions.

        (b) —(1)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures any exposure.

        (ii) To qualify for the simple approach, the financial collateral must meet the following requirements:

        (A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;

        (B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and

        (C) The collateral (other than gold) and the exposure must be denominated in the same currency.

        (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral under this subpart D. For repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions, the collateral is the instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight applicable to the exposure under this subpart.

        (3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section:

        (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a zero percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contract is collateralized by cash on deposit.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 3.32.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:

        (A) The financial collateral is cash on deposit; or

        (B) The financial collateral is an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 3.32, and the national bank or Federal savings association has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.

        (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or single-product netting set of such transactions, and of any collateral that secures a repo-style transaction that is included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part by using the collateral haircut approach in this section. A national bank or Federal savings association may use the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or, with prior written approval of the OCC, its own estimates of haircuts according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount for an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or a single-product netting set of such transactions by setting the exposure amount equal to max {0, [(ΣE − ΣC) + Σ(Es × Hs) + Σ(Efx × Hfx)]}, where:

        (i)(A) For eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions and netting sets thereof, ΣE equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set)); and

        (B) For collateralized derivative contracts and netting sets thereof, ΣE equals the exposure amount of the OTC derivative contract (or netting set) calculated under § 3.34(b)(1) or (2).

        (ii) ΣC equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set));

        (iii) Es equals the absolute value of the net position in a given instrument or in gold (where the net position in the instrument or gold equals the sum of the current fair values of the instrument or gold the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty minus the sum of the current fair values of that same instrument or gold the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty);

        (iv) Hs equals the market price volatility haircut appropriate to the instrument or gold referenced in Es;

        (v) Efx equals the absolute value of the net position of instruments and cash in a currency that is different from the settlement currency (where the net position in a given currency equals the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty minus the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty); and

        (vi) Hfx equals the haircut appropriate to the mismatch between the currency referenced in Efx and the settlement currency.

        (3)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the haircuts for market price volatility (Hs) provided in Table 1 to § 3.37, as adjusted in certain circumstances in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section.

        (ii) For currency mismatches, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a haircut for foreign exchange rate volatility (Hfx) of 8.0 percent, as adjusted in certain circumstances under paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section.

        (iii) For repo-style transactions and client-facing derivative transactions, a national bank or Federal savings association may multiply the standard supervisory haircuts provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section by the square root of   (which equals 0.707107). For client-facing derivative transactions, if a larger scaling factor is applied under § 3.34(f), the same factor must be used to adjust the supervisory haircuts.

        (iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter except in the calculation of the exposure amount for purposes of § 3.35. If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set. A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the standard supervisory haircuts upward using the following formula:

        (A) T equals a holding period of longer than 10 business days for eligible margin loans and derivative contracts other than client-facing derivative transactions or longer than 5 business days for repo-style transactions and client-facing derivative transactions;

        (B) H equals the standard supervisory haircut; and

        (C) T equals 10 business days for eligible margin loans and derivative contracts other than client-facing derivative transactions or 5 business days for repo-style transactions and client-facing derivative transactions.

        (v) If the in*s*trument a national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral does not meet the definition of financial collateral, the national bank or Federal savings association must use a 25.0 percent haircut for market price volatility (H).

        (4)  With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts (Hs and Hfx) using its own internal estimates of the volatilities of market prices and foreign exchange rates:

        (i) To receive OCC approval to use its own internal estimates, a national bank or Federal savings association must satisfy the following minimum standards:

        (A) A national bank or Federal savings association must use a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval.

        (B) The minimum holding period for a repo-style transaction and client-facing derivative transaction is five business days and for an eligible margin loan and a derivative contract other than a client-facing derivative transaction is ten business days except for transactions or netting sets for which paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section applies. When a national bank or Federal savings association calculates an own-estimates haircut on a T-day holding period, which is different from the minimum holding period for the transaction type, the applicable haircut (H) is calculated using the following square root of time formula:

        () T equals 5 for repo-style transactions and client-facing derivative transactions and _1_0 for eligible margin loans and derivative contracts other than client-facing derivative transactions;

        () T equals the holding period used by the national bank or Federal savings association to derive H; and

        () H equals the haircut based on the holding period T.

        (C) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut using a minimum holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter except in the calculation of the exposure amount for purposes of § 3.35. If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut using a minimum holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut for transactions in that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

        (D) A national bank or Federal savings association is required to calculate its own internal estimates with inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the security or category of securities.

        (E) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the national bank's or Federal savings association's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.

        (F) Nothing in this section prevents the OCC from requiring a national bank or Federal savings association to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of own internal estimates for haircuts.

        (G) A national bank or Federal savings association must update its data sets and calculate haircuts no less frequently than quarterly and must also reassess data sets and haircuts whenever market prices change materially.

        (ii) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must at a minimum take into account:

        (A) The type of issuer of the security;

        (B) The credit quality of the security;

        (C) The maturity of the security; and

        (D) The interest rate sensitivity of the security.

        (iii) With respect to debt securities that are not investment grade and equity securities, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate haircut for each individual security.

        (iv) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.

        (v) A national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Unsettled Transactions

        § 3.38   Unsettled transactions.

#### § § 3.38

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        (1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.

        (2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.

        (3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.

        (4) Positive current exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the counterparty.

        (b)  This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:

        (1) Cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;

        (2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions;

        (3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or

        (4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts as provided in § 3.34).

        (c)  In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the OCC may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.

        (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the national bank or Federal savings association by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 3.38.

        (e)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank or Federal savings association has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The national bank or Federal savings association must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the national bank or Federal savings association has received its corresponding deliverables.

        (2) From the business day after the national bank or Federal savings association has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under this subpart D.

        (3) If the national bank or Federal savings association has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was due, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association.

        (f)  Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.

        §§ 3.39-3.40   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 3.39-3.40

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures

        § 3.41   Operational requirements for securitization exposures.

#### § § 3.41

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:

        (1) The exposures are not reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;

        (3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and

        (4) The securitization does not:

        (i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and

        (ii) Contain an early amortization provision.

        (b)  For synthetic securitizations, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:

        (1) The credit risk mitigant is:

        (i) Financial collateral;

        (ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 3.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or

        (iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible credit derivative” in § 3.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 3.2.

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:

        (i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (ii) Require the national bank or Federal savings association to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (iii) Increase the national bank's or Federal savings association's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the national bank or Federal savings association in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or

        (v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the national bank or Federal savings association after the inception of the securitization;

        (3) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and

        (4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.

        (c)  (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 3.42(h), if a national bank or Federal savings association is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:

        (i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:

        (A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;

        (B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average LTV ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);

        (C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and

        (D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and

        (ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.

        § 3.42   Risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.

#### § § 3.42

        (a)  Except as provided elsewhere in this section or in § 3.41:

        (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.

        (2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with §§ 3.43(a) through 3.43(d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 3.43(e), provided, however, that such national bank or Federal savings association must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.

        (3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the national bank or Federal savings association cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 3.44.

        (4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by a national bank or Federal savings association in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), a national bank or Federal savings association may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the national bank or Federal savings association risk weights under §§ 3.41(c), 3.42(a)(1), and 3.43, 3.44, or § 3.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.

        (c) —(1)  The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2), a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.

        (2)  The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security held by a national bank or Federal savings association that has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2) is the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.

        (3)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the national bank or Federal savings association could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.

        (4)  The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 3.34 or § 3.37, as applicable.

        (d)  If a national bank or Federal savings association has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when a national bank or Federal savings association provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the national bank or Federal savings association may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.

        (e)  If a national bank or Federal savings association provides support to a securitization in excess of the national bank's or Federal savings association's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):

        (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must disclose publicly:

        (i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and

        (ii) The risk-based capital impact to the national bank or Federal savings association of providing such implicit support.

        (f)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.

        (2) For a national bank or Federal savings association that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the national bank or Federal savings association may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.

        (g)  Regardless of any other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.

        (h)  (1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:

        (i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the national bank's or Federal savings association's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.

        (iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).

        (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 6.4. For purposes of determining whether a national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).

        (2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by a national bank or Federal savings association on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.

        (3) If a national bank or Federal savings association ceases to be well capitalized under 12 CFR 6.4 or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the national bank or Federal savings association was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.

        (4) The risk-based capital ratios of the national bank or Federal savings association must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for purposes of:

        (i) Determining whether a national bank or Federal savings association is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under the OCC's prompt corrective action regulations; and

        (ii) Reclassifying a well-capitalized national bank or Federal savings association to adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized national bank or Federal savings association to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the national bank or Federal savings association were in the next lower prompt-corrective-action category.

        (i) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk weight using ***th***e SSFA in § 3.43 to an n-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (i). A national bank or Federal savings association must determine its exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.

        (2) For purposes of determining *th*e risk weight for an n-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:

        (i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure.

        (ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals *th*e sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at does not use the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its n-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.

        (4) —(i)  A national bank or Federal savings association that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the national bank or Federal savings association synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 3.34 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b).

        (ii)  (A) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a n-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b) (other than a first-to-default credit derivative) may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of the derivative only if:

        () The national bank or Federal savings association also has obtained credit protection on the same underlying exposures in the form of first-through-(n-_1_)-to-default credit derivatives; or

        () If n-1 of the underlying exposures have already defaulted.

        (B) If a national bank or Federal savings association satisfies *th*e requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the national bank or Federal savings association had only synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the n smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures.

        (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 3.34 for a n-to-default credit derivative *th*at does not meet the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b).

        (j) —(1)  For a guarantee or credit derivative (o**th**er than an n-to-default credit derivative) provided by a national bank or Federal savings association that covers the full amount or a pro rata share of a securitization exposure's principal and interest, the national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight the guarantee or credit derivative as if it holds the portion of the reference exposure covered by the guarantee or credit derivative.

        (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an n-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 3.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral recognized under § 3.37) is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 3.31, in accordance with 34(c).

        (ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association cannot, or chooses not to, recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under § 3.45, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative under § 3.34.

        (A) If the national bank or Federal savings association purchases credit protection from a counterparty that is not a securitization SPE, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to this subpart D.

        (B) If the national bank or Federal savings association purchases the credit protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to section § 3.42, including § 3.42(a)(4) for a credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments).

        § 3.43   Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.

#### § § 3.43

        (a)  To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.

        (b)  To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:

        (1) K is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using this subpart. K is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K equal to 0.08).

        (2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:

        (i) Ninety days or more past due;

        (ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

        (iii) In the process of foreclosure;

        (iv) Held as real estate owned;

        (v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:

        (A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or

        (B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or

        (vi) Is in default.

        (3) Parameter A is *th*e attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 3.42(i) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

        (4) Parameter D is *th*e detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section 42(i) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are  with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

        (5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.

        (c)  K and W are used to calculate K, the augmented value of K, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters ***A*** and D, relative to K determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section and a risk weight of 20 percent.

        (1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.

        (2) When the attachment point, parameter *A*, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (3) When **A** is less than K and D is greater than K, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. For the purpose of this weighted-average calculation:

        (e) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is not subject to subpart F of this part may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 3.44 and 3.45.

        (2) To use the gross-up approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the following four inputs:

        (i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;

        (ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization resides;

        (iii) Exposure amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure calculated under § 3.42(c); and

        (iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.

        (3)  The credit equivalent amount of a securitization exposure under this section equals the sum of:

        (i) The exposure amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure; and

        (ii) The pro rata share multiplied by the enhanced amount, each calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (4)  To calculate risk-weighted assets for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must apply the risk weight required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the credit equivalent amount calculated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight of not less than 20 percent to a securitization exposure.

        § 3.44   Securitization exposures to which the SSFA and gross-up approach do not apply.

#### § § 3.44

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to all securitization exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association does not apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach under § 3.43, except as set forth in this section.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association may determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility by multiplying the exposure amount by the highest risk weight applicable to any of the individual underlying exposures covered by the facility.

        (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may determine the risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure that is in a second loss position or better to an ABCP program that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section by multiplying the exposure amount by the higher of the following risk weights:

        (i) 100 percent; and

        (ii) The highest risk weight applicable to any of the individual underlying exposures of the ABCP program.

        (2)  (i) The exposure is not an eligible ABCP liquidity facility;

        (ii) The exposure must be economically in a second loss position or better, and the first loss position must provide significant credit protection to the second loss position;

        (iii) The exposure qualifies as investment grade; and

        (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association holding the exposure must not retain or provide protection to the first loss position.

        § 3.45   Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures.

#### § § 3.45

        (a)  (1) An originating national bank or Federal savings association that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge its exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization that satisfies the operational criteria provided in § 3.41 may recognize the credit risk mitigant under § 3.36 or § 3.37, but only as provided in this section.

        (2) An investing national bank or Federal savings association that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize the credit risk mitigant under § 3.36 or § 3.37, but only as provided in this section.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must make any applicable adjustment to the protection amount of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative as required in § 3.36(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure. In the context of a synthetic securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all hedged exposures.

#### § §§ 3.46-3.50

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Equity Exposures

        § 3.51   Introduction and exposure measurement.

#### § § 3.51

        (a)  (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, a national bank or Federal savings association must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in 3.52. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the look-through approaches provided in § 3.53 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 3.2) as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 3.53.

        (3)  (i) Stable value protection means a contract where the provider of the contract is obligated to pay:

        (A) The policy owner of a separate account an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and cost basis of the separate account when the policy owner of the separate account surrenders the policy; or

        (B) The beneficiary of the contract an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and book value of a specified portfolio of assets.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases stable value protection on its investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of its investment in the separate account attributable to the stable value protection as an exposure to the provider of the protection and the remaining portion of the carrying value of its separate account as an equity exposure to an investment fund.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association that provides stable value protection must treat the exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carrying value determined as the sum of paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section.

        (b)  For purposes of §§ 3.51 through 3.53, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is:

        (1) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure (other than an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2)), the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of the exposure;

        (2) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2), the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of the exposure less any net unrealized gains on the exposure that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the national bank's or Federal savings association's regulatory capital components;

        (3) For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is not an equity commitment, the effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

        (4) For a commitment to acquire an equity exposure (an equity commitment), the effective notional principal amount of the exposure is multiplied by the following conversion factors (CFs):

        (i) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of one year or less receive a CF of 20 percent.

        (ii) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of over one year receive a CF of 50 percent.

        (iii) Unconditional equity commitments receive a CF of 100 percent.

        § 3.52   Simple risk-weight approach (SRWA).

#### § § 3.52

        (a)  Under the SRWA, a national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined under this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined under § 3.53.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest applicable risk weight in this paragraph (b).

        (1)  An equity exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, an MDB, and any other entity whose credit exposures receive a zero percent risk weight under § 3.32 may be assigned a zero percent risk weight.

        (2)  An equity exposure to a PSE, Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) must be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.

        (3)  The equity exposures set forth in this paragraph (b)(3) must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.

        (i)  An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.

        (ii)  The effective portion of a hedge pair.

        (iii)  Equity exposures, excluding significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.

        (A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a national bank or Federal savings association does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.

        (B) When determining which of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures qualify for a 100 percent risk weight under this paragraph (b), a national bank or Federal savings association first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).

        (4)  Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to § 3.22(d)(2) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.

        (5)  A publicly traded equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge pair) must be assigned a 300 percent risk weight.

        (6)  An equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7)) of this section that is not publicly traded must be assigned a 400 percent risk weight.

        (7)  An equity exposure to an investment firm must be assigned a 600 percent risk weight, provided that the investment firm:

        (i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition; and

        (ii) Has greater than immaterial leverage.

        (c) —(1)  A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.

        (2)  Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the national bank or Federal savings association acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the national bank or Federal savings association will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A national bank or Federal savings association must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E as set forth in this paragraph (c).

        (i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.

        (ii) Under the variability-reduction method of measuring effectiveness:

        (iii) Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then E equals zero.

        (3) The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

        (4) The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

        § 3.53   Equity exposures to investment funds.

#### § § 3.53

        (a)  (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure under § 3.52(b)(3)(i), a national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach described in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alterative modified look-through approach described paragraph (d) of this section, provided, however, that the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an equity exposure under this section is 20 percent.

        (2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.52(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.

        (3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the national bank or Federal savings association does not use the full look-through approach, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 3.52(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:

        (1) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association; and

        (2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of the fund.

        (c)  Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).

        (d)  Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under this subpart based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under this subpart. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under this subpart and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under this subpart until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the highest applicable risk weight. A national bank or Federal savings association may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.

        Sections 3.61 through 3.63 of this subpart establish public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements described in subpart B of this part for a national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent year-end Call Report that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association making public disclosures pursuant to § 3.172. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has not received approval from the OCC to exit parallel run pursuant to § 3.121(d) is subject to the disclosure requirements described in §§ 3.62 and 3.63. A national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent year-end Call Report that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association making public disclosures subject to § 3.172 must comply with § 3.62 unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to the disclosure requirements of § 3.62 or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, total consolidated assets are determined based on the average of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total consolidated assets in the four most recent quarters as reported on the Call Report or the average of the national bank or Federal savings association's total consolidated assets in the most recent consecutive quarters as reported quarterly on the national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report if the national bank or Federal savings association has not filed such a report for each of the most recent four quarters.

        § 3.62   Disclosure requirements.

#### § § 3.62

        (a) A national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 3.63. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. The national bank's or Federal savings association's management may provide all of the disclosures required by §§ 3.61 through 3.63 in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.

        (b) A national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.

        (c) If a national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 concludes that specific commercial or financial information that it would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would be exempt from disclosure by the OCC under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), then the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.

      Qualification

        § 3.121   Qualification process.

#### § § 3.121

        (a)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that is described in § 3.100(b)(1)(i) through (iv) must adopt a written implementation plan no later than six months after the date the national bank or Federal savings association meets a criterion in that section. The implementation plan must incorporate an explicit start date no later than 36 months after the date the national bank or Federal savings association meets at least one criterion under § 3.100(b)(1)(i) through (iv). The OCC may extend the start date.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association that elects to be subject to this appendix under § 3.100(b)(1)(v) must adopt a written implementation plan.

        (b)  (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's implementation plan must address in detail how the national bank or Federal savings association complies, or plans to comply, with the qualification requirements in § 3.122. The national bank or Federal savings association also must maintain a comprehensive and sound planning and governance process to oversee the implementation efforts described in the plan. At a minimum, the plan must:

        (i) Comprehensively address the qualification requirements in § 3.122 for the national bank or Federal savings association and each consolidated subsidiary (U.S. and foreign-based) of the national bank or Federal savings association with respect to all portfolios and exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association and each of its consolidated subsidiaries;

        (ii) Justify and support any proposed temporary or permanent exclusion of business lines, portfolios, or exposures from the application of the advanced approaches in this subpart (which business lines, portfolios, and exposures must be, in the aggregate, immaterial to the national bank or Federal savings association);

        (iii) Include the national bank's or Federal savings association's self-assessment of:

        (A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's current status in meeting the qualification requirements in § 3.122; and

        (B) The consistency of the national bank's or Federal savings association's current practices with the OCC's supervisory guidance on the qualification requirements;

        (iv) Based on the national bank's or Federal savings association's self-assessment, identify and describe the areas in which the national bank or Federal savings association proposes to undertake additional work to comply with the qualification requirements in § 3.122 or to improve the consistency of the national bank's or Federal savings association's current practices with the OCC's supervisory guidance on the qualification requirements (gap analysis);

        (v) Describe what specific actions the national bank or Federal savings association will take to address the areas identified in the gap analysis required by paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section;

        (vi) Identify objective, measurable milestones, including delivery dates and a date when the national bank's or Federal savings association's implementation of the methodologies described in this subpart will be fully operational;

        (vii) Describe resources that have been budgeted and are available to implement the plan; and

        (viii) Receive approval of the national bank's or Federal savings association's board of directors.

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must submit the implementation plan, together with a copy of the minutes of the board of directors' approval, to the OCC at least 60 days before the national bank or Federal savings association proposes to begin its parallel run, unless the OCC waives prior notice.

        (c)  Before determining its risk-weighted assets under this subpart and following adoption of the implementation plan, the national bank or Federal savings association must conduct a satisfactory parallel run. A satisfactory parallel run is a period of no less than four consecutive calendar quarters during which the national bank or Federal savings association complies with the qualification requirements in § 3.122 to the satisfaction of the OCC. During the parallel run, the national bank or Federal savings association must report to the OCC on a calendar quarterly basis its risk-based capital ratios determined in accordance with § 3.10(b)(1) through (3) and § 3.10(d)(1) through (3). During this period, the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum risk-based capital ratios are determined as set forth in subpart D of this part.

        (d)  The OCC will notify the national bank or Federal savings association of the date that the national bank or Federal savings association must begin to use this subpart for purposes of § 3.10 if the OCC determines that:

        (1) The national bank or Federal savings association fully complies with all the qualification requirements in § 3.122;

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association has conducted a satisfactory parallel run under paragraph (c) of this section; and

        (3) The national bank or Federal savings association has an adequate process to ensure ongoing compliance with the qualification requirements in § 3.122.

        § 3.122   Qualification requirements.

#### § § 3.122

        (a)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.

        (2) The systems and processes used by a national bank or Federal savings association for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart must be consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk management processes and management information reporting systems.

        (3) Each national bank or Federal savings association must have an appropriate infrastructure with risk measurement and management processes that meet the qualification requirements of this section and are appropriate given the national bank's or Federal savings association's size and level of complexity. Regardless of whether the systems and models that generate the risk parameters necessary for calculating a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirements are located at any affiliate of the national bank or Federal savings association, the national bank or Federal savings association itself must ensure that the risk parameters and reference data used to determine its risk-based capital requirements are representative of long run experience with respect to its own credit risk and operational risk exposures.

        (b)  (1)(i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating and segmentation system that accurately, reliably, and meaningfully differentiates among degrees of credit risk for the national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale and retail exposures. When assigning an internal risk rating, a national bank or Federal savings association may consider a third-party assessment of credit risk, provided that the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating assignment does not rely solely on the external assessment.

        (ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses multiple rating or segmentation systems, the national bank's or Federal savings association's rationale for assigning an obligor or exposure to a particular system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the obligor's or exposure's level of risk. A national bank or Federal savings association must not inappropriately allocate obligors or exposures across systems to minimize regulatory capital requirements.

        (iii) In assigning ratings to wholesale obligors and exposures, including loss severity ratings grades to wholesale exposures, and assigning retail exposures to retail segments, a national bank or Federal savings association must use all relevant and material information and ensure that the information is current.

        (iv) When assigning an obligor to a PD rating or retail exposure to a PD segment, a national bank or Federal savings association must assess the obligor or retail borrower's ability and willingness to contractually perform, taking a conservative view of projected information.

        (2) For wholesale exposures:

        (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each obligor to a single rating grade (reflecting the obligor's likelihood of default). A national bank or Federal savings association may elect, however, not to assign to a rating grade an obligor to whom the national bank or Federal savings association extends credit based solely on the financial strength of a guarantor, provided that all of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures to the obligor are fully covered by eligible guarantees, the national bank or Federal savings association applies the PD substitution approach in § 3.134(c)(1) to all exposures to that obligor, and the national bank or Federal savings association immediately assigns the obligor to a rating grade if a guarantee can no longer be recognized under this part. The national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale obligor rating system must have at least seven discrete rating grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one rating grade for defaulted obligors.

        (ii) Unless the national bank or Federal savings association has chosen to directly assign LGD estimates to each wholesale exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each wholesale exposure to a loss severity rating grade (reflecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's estimate of the LGD of the exposure). A national bank or Federal savings association employing loss severity rating grades must have a sufficiently granular loss severity grading system to avoid grouping together exposures with widely ranging LGDs.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an effective process to obtain and update in a timely manner relevant and material information on obligor and exposure characteristics that affect PD, LGD and EAD.

        (3) For retail exposures:

        (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal system that groups retail exposures into the appropriate retail exposure subcategory and groups the retail exposures in each retail exposure subcategory into separate segments with homogeneous risk characteristics that provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. The national bank's or Federal savings association's system must identify and group in separate segments by subcategories exposures identified in § 3.131(c)(2)(ii) and (iii).

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal system that captures all relevant exposure risk characteristics, including borrower credit score, product and collateral types, as well as exposure delinquencies, and must consider cross-collateral provisions, where present.

        (iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and, if appropriate, update assignments of individual retail exposures to segments and the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk segment. These reviews must occur whenever the national bank or Federal savings association receives new material information, but generally no less frequently than quarterly, and, in all cases, at least annually.

        (4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating policy for wholesale exposures must describe the national bank's or Federal savings association's rating philosophy (that is, must describe how wholesale obligor rating assignments are affected by the national bank's or Federal savings association's choice of the range of economic, business, and industry conditions that are considered in the obligor rating process).

        (5) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating system for wholesale exposures must provide for the review and update (as appropriate) of each obligor rating and (if applicable) each loss severity rating whenever the national bank or Federal savings association obtains relevant and material information on the obligor or exposure that affects PD, LGD and EAD, but no less frequently than annually.

        (c)  (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a comprehensive risk parameter quantification process that produces accurate, timely, and reliable estimates of the risk parameters on a consistent basis for the national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale and retail exposures.

        (2) A national bank's or Federal savings association's estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material, and available data that is reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual wholesale and retail exposures and of sufficient quality to support the determination of risk-based capital requirements for the exposures. In particular, the population of exposures in the data used for estimation purposes, the lending standards in use when the data were generated, and other relevant characteristics, should closely match or be comparable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures and standards. In addition, a national bank or Federal savings association must:

        (i) Demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience, including periods of economic downturn conditions, whether internal or external data are used;

        (ii) Take into account any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period;

        (iii) Promptly reflect technical advances, new data, and other information as they become available;

        (iv) Demonstrate that the data used to estimate risk parameters support the accuracy and robustness of those estimates; and

        (v) Demonstrate that its estimation technique performs well in out-of-sample tests whenever possible.

        (3) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk parameter quantification process must produce appropriately conservative risk parameter estimates where the national bank or Federal savings association has limited relevant data, and any adjustments that are part of the quantification process must not result in a pattern of bias toward lower risk parameter estimates.

        (4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk parameter estimation process should not rely on the possibility of U.S. government financial assistance, except for the financial assistance that the U.S. government has a legally binding commitment to provide.

        (5) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to demonstrate which variables have been found to be statistically significant with regard to EAD. The national bank's or Federal savings association's EAD estimates must reflect its specific policies and strategies with regard to account management, including account monitoring and payment processing, and its ability and willingness to prevent further drawdowns in circumstances short of payment default. The national bank or Federal savings association must have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor current outstanding amounts against committed lines, and changes in outstanding amounts per obligor and obligor rating grade and per retail segment. The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to monitor outstanding amounts on a daily basis.

        (6) At a minimum, PD estimates for wholesale obligors and retail segments must be based on at least five years of default data. LGD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of loss severity data, and LGD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of loss severity data. EAD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of exposure amount data, and EAD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of exposure amount data. If the national bank or Federal savings association has relevant and material reference data that span a longer period of time than the minimum time periods specified above, the national bank or Federal savings association must incorporate such data in its estimates, provided that it does not place undue weight on periods of favorable or benign economic conditions relative to periods of economic downturn conditions.

        (7) Default, loss severity, and exposure amount data must include periods of economic downturn conditions, or the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust its estimates of risk parameters to compensate for the lack of data from periods of economic downturn conditions.

        (8) The national bank's or Federal savings association's PD, LGD, and EAD estimates must be based on the definition of default in § 3.101.

        (9) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal data obtained prior to becoming subject to this subpart E or external data to arrive at PD, LGD, or EAD estimates, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the OCC that the national bank or Federal savings association has made appropriate adjustments if necessary to be consistent with the definition of default in § 3.101. Internal data obtained after the national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to this subpart E must be consistent with the definition of default in § 3.101.

        (10) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and update (as appropriate) its risk parameters and its risk parameter quantification process at least annually.

        (11) The national bank or Federal savings association must, at least annually, conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of reference data to determine relevance of the reference data to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures, quality of reference data to support PD, LGD, and EAD estimates, and consistency of reference data to the definition of default in § 3.101.

        (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.132 to use the internal models methodology for counterparty credit risk and the advanced CVA approach for the CVA capital requirement.

        (e)  A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.135 to use the double default treatment.

        (f)  A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.153 to use the internal models approach for equity exposures.

        (g)  (1) Operational risk management processes. A national bank or Federal savings association must:

        (i) Have an operational risk management function that:

        (A) Is independent of business line management; and

        (B) Is responsible for designing, implementing, and overseeing the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk data and assessment systems, operational risk quantification systems, and related processes;

        (ii) Have and document a process (which must capture business environment and internal control factors affecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk profile) to identify, measure, monitor, and control operational risk in the national bank's or Federal savings association's products, activities, processes, and systems; and

        (iii) Report operational risk exposures, operational loss events, and other relevant operational risk information to business unit management, senior management, and the board of directors (or a designated committee of the board).

        (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must have operational risk data and assessment systems that capture operational risks to which the national bank or Federal savings association is exposed. The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk data and assessment systems must:

        (i) Be structured in a manner consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's current business activities, risk profile, technological processes, and risk management processes; and

        (ii) Include credible, transparent, systematic, and verifiable processes that incorporate the following elements on an ongoing basis:

        (A)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a systematic process for capturing and using internal operational loss event data in its operational risk data and assessment systems.

        () The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk data and assessment systems must include a historical observation period of at least five years for internal operational loss event data (or such shorter period approved by the OCC to address transitional situations, such as integrating a new business line).

        () The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to map its internal operational loss event data into the seven operational loss event type categories.

        () The national bank or Federal savings association may refrain from collecting internal operational loss event data for individual operational losses below established dollar threshold amounts if the national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that the thresholds are reasonable, do not exclude important internal operational loss event data, and permit the national bank or Federal savings association to capture substantially all the dollar value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational losses.

        (B)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a systematic process for determining its methodologies for incorporating external operational loss event data into its operational risk data and assessment systems.

        (C)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a systematic process for determining its methodologies for incorporating scenario analysis into its operational risk data and assessment systems.

        (D)  The national bank or Federal savings association must incorporate business environment and internal control factors into its operational risk data and assessment systems. The national bank or Federal savings association must also periodically compare the results of its prior business environment and internal control factor assessments against its actual operational losses incurred in the intervening period.

        (3)  (i) The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk quantification systems:

        (A) Must generate estimates of the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure using its operational risk data and assessment systems;

        (B) Must employ a unit of measure that is appropriate for the national bank's or Federal savings association's range of business activities and the variety of operational loss events to which it is exposed, and that does not combine business activities or operational loss events with demonstrably different risk profiles within the same loss distribution;

        (C) Must include a credible, transparent, systematic, and verifiable approach for weighting each of the four elements, described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, that a national bank or Federal savings association is required to incorporate into its operational risk data and assessment systems;

        (D) May use internal estimates of dependence among operational losses across and within units of measure if the national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that its process for estimating dependence is sound, robust to a variety of scenarios, and implemented with integrity, and allows for uncertainty surrounding the estimates. If the national bank or Federal savings association has not made such a demonstration, it must sum operational risk exposure estimates across units of measure to calculate its total operational risk exposure; and

        (E) Must be reviewed and updated (as appropriate) whenever the national bank or Federal savings association becomes aware of information that may have a material effect on the national bank's or Federal savings association's estimate of operational risk exposure, but the review and update must occur no less frequently than annually.

        (ii) With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may generate an estimate of its operational risk exposure using an alternative approach to that specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. A national bank or Federal savings association proposing to use such an alternative operational risk quantification system must submit a proposal to the OCC. In determining whether to approve a national bank's or Federal savings association's proposal to use an alternative operational risk quantification system, the OCC will consider the following principles:

        (A) Use of the alternative operational risk quantification system will be allowed only on an exception basis, considering the size, complexity, and risk profile of the national bank or Federal savings association;

        (B) The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate that its estimate of its operational risk exposure generated under the alternative operational risk quantification system is appropriate and can be supported empirically; and

        (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must not use an allocation of operational risk capital requirements that includes entities other than depository institutions or the benefits of diversification across entities.

        (h)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must have data management and maintenance systems that adequately support all aspects of its advanced systems and the timely and accurate reporting of risk-based capital requirements.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must retain data using an electronic format that allows timely retrieval of data for analysis, validation, reporting, and disclosure purposes.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must retain sufficient data elements related to key risk drivers to permit adequate monitoring, validation, and refinement of its advanced systems.

        (i)  (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's senior management must ensure that all components of the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced systems function effectively and comply with the qualification requirements in this section.

        (2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's board of directors (or a designated committee of the board) must at least annually review the effectiveness of, and approve, the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced systems.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an effective system of controls and oversight that:

        (i) Ensures ongoing compliance with the qualification requirements in this section;

        (ii) Maintains the integrity, reliability, and accuracy of the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced systems; and

        (iii) Includes adequate governance and project management processes.

        (4) The national bank or Federal savings association must validate, on an ongoing basis, its advanced systems. The national bank's or Federal savings association's validation process must be independent of the advanced systems' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:

        (i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the advanced systems;

        (ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking; and

        (iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting.

        (5) The national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal audit function or equivalent function that is independent of business-line management that at least annually:

        (i) Reviews the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced systems and associated operations, including the operations of its credit function and estimations of PD, LGD, and EAD;

        (ii) Assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced systems; and

        (iii) Documents and reports its findings to the national bank's or Federal savings association's board of directors (or a committee thereof).

        (6) The national bank or Federal savings association must periodically stress test its advanced systems. The stress testing must include a consideration of how economic cycles, especially downturns, affect risk-based capital requirements (including migration across rating grades and segments and the credit risk mitigation benefits of double default treatment).

        (j)  The national bank or Federal savings association must adequately document all material aspects of its advanced systems.

        § 3.123   Ongoing qualification.

#### § § 3.123

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must meet all the qualification requirements in § 3.122 on an ongoing basis. A national bank or Federal savings association must notify the OCC when the national bank or Federal savings association makes any change to an advanced system that would result in a material change in the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced approaches total risk-weighted asset amount for an exposure type or when the national bank or Federal savings association makes any significant change to its modeling assumptions.

        (b)  (1) If the OCC determines that a national bank or Federal savings association that uses this subpart and that has conducted a satisfactory parallel run fails to comply with the qualification requirements in § 3.122, the OCC will notify the national bank or Federal savings association in writing of the national bank's or Federal savings association's failure to comply.

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must establish and submit a plan satisfactory to the OCC to return to compliance with the qualification requirements.

        (3) In addition, if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets are not commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit, market, operational, or other risks, the OCC may require such a national bank or Federal savings association to calculate its advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets with any modifications provided by the OCC.

        § 3.124   Merger and acquisition transitional arrangements.

#### § § 3.124

        (a)  If a national bank or Federal savings association merges with or acquires a company that does not calculate its risk-based capital requirements using advanced systems, the national bank or Federal savings association may use subpart D of this part to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts for the merged or acquired company's exposures for up to 24 months after the calendar quarter during which the merger or acquisition consummates. The OCC may extend this transition period for up to an additional 12 months. Within 90 days of consummating the merger or acquisition, the national bank or Federal savings association must submit to the OCC an implementation plan for using its advanced systems for the acquired company. During the period in which subpart D of this part applies to the merged or acquired company, any ALLL or AACL, as applicable, net of allocated transfer risk reserves established pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3904, associated with the merged or acquired company's exposures may be included in the acquiring national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 2 capital up to 1.25 percent of the acquired company's risk-weighted assets. All general allowances of the merged or acquired company must be excluded from the national bank's or Federal savings association's eligible credit reserves. In addition, the risk-weighted assets of the merged or acquired company are not included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit-risk-weighted assets but are included in total risk-weighted assets. If a national bank or Federal savings association relies on this paragraph (a), the national bank or Federal savings association must disclose publicly the amounts of risk-weighted assets and qualifying capital calculated under this subpart for the acquiring national bank or Federal savings association and under subpart D of this part for the acquired company.

        (b)  (1) If a national bank or Federal savings association merges with or acquires a company that calculates its risk-based capital requirements using advanced systems, the national bank or Federal savings association may use the acquired company's advanced systems to determine total risk-weighted assets for the merged or acquired company's exposures for up to 24 months after the calendar quarter during which the acquisition or merger consummates. The OCC may extend this transition period for up to an additional 12 months. Within 90 days of consummating the merger or acquisition, the national bank or Federal savings association must submit to the OCC an implementation plan for using its advanced systems for the merged or acquired company.

        (2) If the acquiring national bank or Federal savings association is not subject to the advanced approaches in this subpart at the time of acquisition or merger, during the period when subpart D of this part applies to the acquiring national bank or Federal savings association, the ALLL or AACL, as applicable associated with the exposures of the merged or acquired company may not be directly included in tier 2 capital. Rather, any excess eligible credit reserves associated with the merged or acquired company's exposures may be included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 2 capital up to 0.6 percent of the credit-risk-weighted assets associated with those exposures.

        §§ 3.125-3.130   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 3.125-3.130

      Risk-Weighted Assets for General Credit Risk

        § 3.131   Mechanics for calculating total wholesale and retail risk-weighted assets.

#### § § 3.131

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its total wholesale and retail risk-weighted asset amount in four distinct phases:

        (1) Phase 1—categorization of exposures;

        (2) Phase 2—assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and segmentation of retail exposures;

        (3) Phase 3—assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures; and

        (4) Phase 4—calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts.

        (b)  The national bank or Federal savings association must determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The national bank or Federal savings association must categorize each retail exposure as a residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or an other retail exposure. The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which wholesale exposures are HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions to which § 3.136 applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are used as credit risk mitigants. The national bank or Federal savings association must identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, as well as any non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

        (c) —(1)  (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must assign each obligor of a wholesale exposure to a single obligor rating grade and must assign each wholesale exposure to which it does not directly assign an LGD estimate to a loss severity rating grade.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its wholesale obligors are in default.

        (2)  (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its retail exposures are in default. The national bank or Federal savings association must segment defaulted retail exposures separately from non-defaulted retail exposures.

        (iii) If the national bank or Federal savings association determines the EAD for eligible margin loans using the approach in § 3.132(b), the national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its retail exposures are eligible margin loans for which the national bank or Federal savings association uses this EAD approach and must segment such eligible margin loans separately from other retail exposures.

        (3)  A national bank or Federal savings association may group its eligible purchased wholesale exposures into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the wholesale exposure formula in Table 1 of this section to determine the risk-based capital requirement for each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures.

        (d) —(1)  Subject to the limitations in this paragraph (d), the national bank or Federal savings association must:

        (i) Associate a PD with each wholesale obligor rating grade;

        (ii) Associate an LGD with each wholesale loss severity rating grade or assign an LGD to each wholesale exposure;

        (iii) Assign an EAD and M to each wholesale exposure; and

        (iv) Assign a PD, LGD, and EAD to each segment of retail exposures.

        (2)  The PD for each wholesale obligor or retail segment may not be less than 0.03 percent, except for exposures to or directly and unconditionally guaranteed by a sovereign entity, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, or a multilateral development bank, to which the national bank or Federal savings association assigns a rating grade associated with a PD of less than 0.03 percent.

        (3)  The LGD for each segment of residential mortgage exposures may not be less than 10 percent, except for segments of residential mortgage exposures for which all or substantially all of the principal of each exposure is either:

        (i) Directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a sovereign entity; or

        (ii) Guaranteed by a contingent obligation of the U.S. government or its agencies, the enforceability of which is dependent upon some affirmative action on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party (for example, meeting servicing requirements).

        (4)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a PD, LGD, EAD, and M to each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures. If the national bank or Federal savings association can estimate ECL (but not PD or LGD) for a segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the LGD of the segment equals 100 percent and that the PD of the segment equals ECL divided by EAD. The estimated ECL must be calculated for the exposures without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.

        (5)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives in support of a wholesale exposure by applying the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment to the exposure as provided in § 3.134 or, if applicable, applying double default treatment to the exposure as provided in § 3.135. A national bank or Federal savings association may decide separately for each wholesale exposure that qualifies for the double default treatment under § 3.135 whether to apply the double default treatment or to use the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment without recognizing double default effects.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of guarantees and credit derivatives in support of retail exposures in a segment when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In doing so, a national bank or Federal savings association must consider all relevant available information.

        (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of a wholesale exposure when quantifying the LGD of the exposure, and may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of retail exposures when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In order to do so, a national bank or Federal savings association must have established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty, and risk management processes.

        (6)  A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its EAD for an OTC derivative contract as provided in § 3.132 (c) and (d). A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk-reducing effects of financial collateral in support of a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan and of any collateral in support of a repo-style transaction that is included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part through an adjustment to EAD as provided in § 3.132(b) and (d). A national bank or Federal savings association that takes collateral into account through such an adjustment to EAD under § 3.132 may not reflect such collateral in LGD.

        (7)  An exposure's M must be no greater than five years and no less than one year, except that an exposure's M must be no less than one day if the exposure is a trade related letter of credit, or if the exposure has an original maturity of less than one year and is not part of a national bank's or Federal savings association's ongoing financing of the obligor. An exposure is not part of a national bank's or Federal savings association's ongoing financing of the obligor if the national bank or Federal savings association:

        (i) Has a legal and practical ability not to renew or roll over the exposure in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor;

        (ii) Makes an independent credit decision at the inception of the exposure and at every renewal or roll over; and

        (iii) Has no substantial commercial incentive to continue its credit relationship with the obligor in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor.

        (8)  A national bank or Federal savings association may attribute an EAD of zero to exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing counterparty credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions.

        (e) —(1)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the dollar risk-based capital requirement for each of its wholesale exposures to a non-defaulted obligor (except for eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives that hedge another wholesale exposure, IMM exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions, and exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies the double default treatment in § 3.135) and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures by inserting the assigned risk parameters for the wholesale obligor and exposure or retail segment into the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 and multiplying the output of the formula (K) by the EAD of the exposure or segment. Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply a 300 percent risk weight to the EAD of an eligible margin loan if the national bank or Federal savings association is not able to meet the OCC's requirements for estimation of PD and LGD for the margin loan.

        (ii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a non-defaulted obligor and segment of non-defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and in § 3.135(e) equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.

        (iii) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.

        (2) —(i)  The dollar risk-based capital requirement for each wholesale exposure not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government to a defaulted obligor and each segment of defaulted retail exposures not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government equals 0.08 multiplied by the EAD of the exposure or segment.

        (ii)  The dollar risk-based capital requirement for each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and each segment of defaulted retail exposures covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government equals the sum of:

        (A) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.016, and

        (B) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.08.

        (iii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section plus the dollar risk-based capital requirements each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and for each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.

        (iv) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to defaulted obligors and segments of defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.

        (3)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk-weighted asset amount of zero to cash owned and held in all offices of the national bank or Federal savings association or in transit and for gold bullion held in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own vaults, or held in another national bank's or Federal savings association's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent the gold bullion assets are offset by gold bullion liabilities.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to 20 percent of the carrying value of cash items in the process of collection.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to 50 percent of the carrying value to a pre-sold construction loan unless the purchase contract is cancelled, in which case a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to a 100 percent of the carrying value of the pre-sold construction loan.

        (iv) The risk-weighted asset amount for the residual value of a retail lease exposure equals such residual value.

        (v) The risk-weighted asset amount for DTAs arising from temporary differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could realize through net operating loss carrybacks equals the carrying value, netted in accordance with § 3.22.

        (vi) The risk-weighted asset amount for MSAs, DTAs arising from temporary timing differences that the national bank or Federal savings association could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted pursuant to § 3.22(d) equals the amount not subject to deduction multiplied by 250 percent.

        (vii) The risk-weighted asset amount for any other on-balance-sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, securitization, IMM, or equity exposure, cleared transaction, or default fund contribution and is not subject to deduction under § 3.22(a), (c), or (d) equals the carrying value of the asset.

        (viii) The risk-weighted asset amount for a Paycheck Protection Program covered loan as defined in section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)) equals zero.

        (4)  The risk-weighted asset amount of a portfolio of exposures for which the national bank or Federal savings association has demonstrated to the OCC's satisfaction that the portfolio (when combined with all other portfolios of exposures that the national bank or Federal savings association seeks to treat under this paragraph (e)) is not material to the national bank or Federal savings association is the sum of the carrying values of on-balance sheet exposures plus the notional amounts of off-balance sheet exposures in the portfolio. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the notional amount of an OTC derivative contract that is not a credit derivative is the EAD of the derivative as calculated in § 3.132.

        § 3.132   Counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts.

#### § § 3.132

        (a)  (1) Instead of an LGD estimation methodology, a national bank or Federal savings association may use the following methodologies to recognize the benefits of financial collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized OTC derivative contracts and single product netting sets of such transactions, and to recognize the benefits of any collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions that are included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part:

        (i) The collateral haircut approach set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

        (ii) The internal models methodology set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; and

        (iii) For single product netting sets of repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans, the simple VaR methodology set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association may use any combination of the three methodologies for collateral recognition; however, it must use the same methodology for transactions in the same category.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodology in paragraph (c) of this section, or with prior written approval of the OCC, the internal model methodology in paragraph (d) of this section, to calculate EAD for an OTC derivative contract or a set of OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. To estimate EAD for qualifying cross-product master netting agreements, a national bank or Federal savings association may only use the internal models methodology in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (4) A national bank or Federal savings association must also use the methodology in paragraph (e) of this section to calculate the risk-weighted asset amounts for CVA for OTC derivatives.

        (b) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, or single-product netting set of such transactions by factoring the collateral into its LGD estimates for the exposure. Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association may estimate an unsecured LGD for the exposure, as well as for any repo-style transaction that is included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part, and determine the EAD of the exposure using:

        (i) The collateral haircut approach described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

        (ii) For netting sets only, the simple VaR methodology described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; or

        (iii) The internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (2) —(i)  A national bank or Federal savings association may determine EAD for an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, or netting set by setting EAD equal to max

        (A) ΣE equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set));

        (B) ΣC equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set));

        (C) E equal*s* the absolute value of the net position in a given instrument or in gold (where the net position in a given instrument or in gold equals the sum of the current fair values of the instrument or gold the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty minus the sum of the current fair values of that same instrument or gold the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty);

        (D) H equal**s** the market price volatility haircut appropriate to the instrument or gold referenced in E;

        (E) E equals the absolute value of the net position of instruments and cash in a currency that is different from the settlement currency (where the net position in a given currency equals the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty minus the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty); and

        (F) H equals the haircut appropriate to the mismatch between the currency referenced in E and the settlement currency.

        (ii)  (A) Under the standard supervisory haircuts approach:

        () A national bank or Federal *s*avings association must use the haircuts for market price volatility (H) in Table _1_ to § _3_.132, as adjusted in certain circumstances as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)() and () of this section;

        () For currency mismatches, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a haircut for foreign exchange rate volatility (H) of 8 percent, as adjusted in certain circumstances as provided in paragraphs (b)(_2_)(ii)(A)() and () of this section.

        () For repo-style transactions and client-facing derivative transactions, a national bank or Federal savings association may multiply the supervisory haircuts provided in paragraphs (b)(_2_)(ii)(A)() and () of this section by the square root of   (which equals 0.707_1_07). If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a longer holding period is appropriate for client-facing derivative transactions, then it must use a larger scaling factor to adjust for the longer holding period pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section.

        () A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period longer than ten business days (for eligible margin loans) or five business days (for repo-style transactions), using the formula provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section where the conditions in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)() apply. If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a minimum holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter (except when a national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 3.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a minimum holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted longer than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a minimum holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

        ()() A nat__i__onal bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period longer than ten business days for collateral associated with derivative contracts (five business days for client-facing derivative contracts) using the formula provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section where the conditions in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)()() apply. For collateral associated with a derivative contract that is within a netting set that is composed of more than __5__,000 derivative contracts that are not cleared transactions, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a minimum holding period of twenty business days. If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or a derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a minimum holding period of twenty business days.

        () Notw__i__thstanding paragraph (b)(2)(_ii_)(A)() or () or (b)(2)(ii)(A)()() of this section, for collateral associated with a derivative contract in a netting set under which more than two margin disputes that lasted longer than the holding period occurred during the previous two quarters, the minimum holding period is twice the amount provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)() or () or (b)(2)(ii)(A)()() of this section.

        () A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the standard supervisory haircuts upward, pursuant to the adjustments provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)() through () of this section, using the following formula:

        () If the instrument a national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral does not meet the definition of financial collateral, the national bank or Federal savings association must use a 25.0 percent haircut for market price volatility (H).

        (iii)  With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal *s*avings association may calculate haircuts (H and H) using its own internal estimates of the volatilities of market prices and foreign exchange rates.

        (A) To receive OCC approval to use its own internal estimates, a national bank or Federal savings association must satisfy the following minimum quantitative standards:

        () A national bank or Federal savings association must use a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval.

        () The minimum holding period for a repo-style transaction is five business days and for an eligible margin loan is ten business days except for transactions or netting sets for which paragraph (b)(_2_)(iii)(A)() of this section applies. When a national bank or Federal savings association calculates an own-estimates haircut on a T-day holding period, which is different from the minimum holding period for the transaction type, the applicable haircut (H) is calculated using the following square root of time formula:

        () T equals 5 for repo-style transact_i_ons and 10 for eligible margin loans;

        () T equals the holding period used by the national bank or Federal savings association to derive H; and

        () H equals the haircut based on the holding period T

        () If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut using a minimum holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter (except when a national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § _3_.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut using a minimum holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut for transactions in that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

        () A national bank or Federal savings association is required to calculate its own internal estimates with inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the security or category of securities.

        () A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the national bank's or Federal savings association's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.

        () Nothing in this section prevents the OCC from requiring a national bank or Federal savings association to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of own internal estimates for haircuts.

        () A national bank or Federal savings association must update its data sets and calculate haircuts no less frequently than quarterly and must also reassess data sets and haircuts whenever market prices change materially.

        (B) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must at a minimum take into account:

        () The type of issuer of the security;

        () The credit quality of the security;

        () The maturity of the security; and

        () The interest rate sensitivity of the security.

        (C) With respect to debt securities that are not investment grade and equity securities, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate haircut for each individual security.

        (D) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.

        (E) A national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).

        (3)  With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may estimate EAD for a netting set using a VaR model that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In such event, the national bank or Federal savings association must set EAD equal to max {0, [(ΣE − ΣC) + PFE]}, where:

        (i) ΣE equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the netting set);

        (ii) ΣC equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the netting set); and

        (iii) PFE (potential future exposure) equals the national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval for an increase in the value of (ΣE − ΣC) over a five-business-day holding period for repo-style transactions, or over a ten-business-day holding period for eligible margin loans except for netting sets for which paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section applies using a minimum one-year historical observation period of price data representing the instruments that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. The national bank or Federal savings association must validate its VaR model by establishing and maintaining a rigorous and regular backtesting regime.

        (iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a twenty-business-day holding period for the following quarter (except when a national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 3.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a twenty-business-day holding period. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must set its PFE for that netting set equal to an estimate over a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

        (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the EAD for a derivative contract using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. If a national bank or Federal savings association elects to use SA-CCR for one or more derivative contracts, the exposure amount determined under SA-CCR is the EAD for the derivative contract or derivative contracts. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the same methodology to calculate the exposure amount for all its derivative contracts and may change its election only with prior approval of the OCC. A national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the national bank or Federal savings association has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.

        (2)  For purposes of this paragraph (c) of this section, the following definitions apply:

        (i)  means the last date of the period referenced by an interest rate or credit derivative contract or, if the derivative contract references another instrument, by the underlying instrument, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (ii)  means the first date of the period referenced by an interest rate or credit derivative contract or, if the derivative contract references the value of another instrument, by underlying instrument, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (iii)  means:

        (A) With respect to interest rate derivative contracts, all such contracts within a netting set that reference the same reference currency;

        (B) With respect to exchange rate derivative contracts, all such contracts within a netting set that reference the same currency pair;

        (C) With respect to credit derivative contract, all such contracts within a netting set;

        (D) With respect to equity derivative contracts, all such contracts within a netting set;

        (E) With respect to a commodity derivative contract, all such contracts within a netting set that reference one of the following commodity categories: Energy, metal, agricultural, or other commodities;

        (F) With respect to basis derivative contracts, all such contracts within a netting set that reference the same pair of risk factors and are denominated in the same currency; or

        (G) With respect to volatility derivative contracts, all such contracts within a netting set that reference one of interest rate, exchange rate, credit, equity, or commodity risk factors, separated according to the requirements under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section.

        (H) If the risk of a derivative contract materially depends on more than one of interest rate, exchange rate, credit, equity, or commodity risk factors, the OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to include the derivative contract in each appropriate hedging set under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section.

        (3)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:

        (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under § 3.134 or § 3.135 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section so long as the national bank or Federal savings association does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that is the protection provider in a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as a wholesale exposure to the reference obligor and is not required to calculate a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this section, so long as it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes all or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes (unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section).

        (4)  A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 3.151-3.155 (unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in § 3.155, the national bank or Federal savings association must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.

        (5)  (i) The exposure amount of a netting set, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, is equal to 1.4 multiplied by the sum of the replacement cost of the netting set, as calculated under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, and the potential future exposure of the netting set, as calculated under paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the exposure amount of a netting set subject to a variation margin agreement, excluding a netting set that is subject to a variation margin agreement under which the counterparty to the variation margin agreement is not required to post variation margin, is equal to the lesser of the exposure amount of the netting set calculated under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and the exposure amount of the netting set calculated as if the netting set were not subject to a variation margin agreement.

        (iii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the exposure amount of a netting set that consists of only sold options in which the premiums have been fully paid by the counterparty to the options and where the options are not subject to a variation margin agreement is zero.

        (iv) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the exposure amount of a netting set in which the counterparty is a commercial end-user is equal to the sum of replacement cost, as calculated under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, and the potential future exposure of the netting set, as calculated under paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

        (v) For purposes of the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and all calculations that are part of that exposure amount, a national bank or Federal savings association may elect, at the netting set level, to treat a derivative contract that is a cleared transaction that is not subject to a variation margin agreement as one that is subject to a variation margin agreement, if the derivative contract is subject to a requirement that the counterparties make daily cash payments to each other to account for changes in the fair value of the derivative contract and to reduce the net position of the contract to zero. If a national bank or Federal savings association makes an election under this paragraph (c)(5)(v) for one derivative contract, it must treat all other derivative contracts within the same netting set that are eligible for an election under this paragraph (c)(5)(v) as derivative contracts that are subject to a variation margin agreement.

        (vi) For purposes of the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and all calculations that are part of that exposure amount, a national bank or Federal savings association may elect to treat a credit derivative contract, equity derivative contract, or commodity derivative contract that references an index as if it were multiple derivative contracts each referencing one component of the index.

        (6) —(i)  The replacement cost of a netting set subject to a variation margin agreement, excluding a netting set that is subject to a variation margin agreement under which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin, is the greater of:

        (A) The sum of the fair values (after excluding any valuation adjustments) of the derivative contracts within the netting set less the sum of the net independent collateral amount and the variation margin amount applicable to such derivative contracts;

        (B) The sum of the variation margin threshold and the minimum transfer amount applicable to the derivative contracts within the netting set less the net independent collateral amount applicable to such derivative contracts; or

        (C) Zero.

        (ii)  The replacement cost of a netting set that is not subject to a variation margin agreement under which the counterparty must post variation margin to the national bank or Federal savings association is the greater of:

        (A) The sum of the fair values (after excluding any valuation adjustments) of the derivative contracts within the netting set less the sum of the net independent collateral amount and variation margin amount applicable to such derivative contracts; or

        (B) Zero.

        (iii)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, the replacement cost for multiple netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section.

        (iv)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, the replacement cost for a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements or a hybrid netting set must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(11)(i) of this section.

        (7)  The potential future exposure of a netting set is the product of the PFE multiplier and the aggregated amount.

        (i)  The PFE multiplier is calculated according to the following formula:

        (ii)  The aggregated amount is the sum of all hedging set amounts, as calculated under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, within a netting set.

        (iii)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section and when calculating the potential future exposure for purposes of total leverage exposure under § 3.10(c)(2)(ii)(B), the potential future exposure for multiple netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(10)(ii) of this section.

        (iv)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section and when calculating the potential future exposure for purposes of total leverage exposure under § 3.10(c)(2)(ii)(B), the potential future exposure for a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements or a hybrid netting set must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(11)(ii) of this section.

        (8) —(i)  To calculate the hedging set amount of an interest rate derivative contract hedging set, a national bank or Federal savings association may use either of the formulas provided in paragraphs (c)(8)(i)(A) and (B) of this section:

        (A) Formula 1 is as follows:

        (B) Formula 2 is as follows:

        (ii)  For an exchange rate derivative contract hedging set, the hedging set amount equals the absolute value of the sum of the adjusted derivative contract amounts, as calculated under paragraph (c)(9) of this section, within the hedging set.

        (iii)  The hedging set amount of a credit derivative contract hedging set or equity derivative contract hedging set within a netting set is calculated according to the following formula:

        (iv)  The hedging set amount of a commodity derivative contract hedging set within a netting set is calculated according to the following formula:

        (v)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate hedging set amount for each basis derivative contract hedging set and each volatility derivative contract hedging set. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate such hedging set amounts using one of the formulas under paragraphs (c)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section that corresponds to the primary risk factor of the hedging set being calculated.

        (9) —(i)  To calculate the adjusted derivative contract amount of a derivative contract, a national bank or Federal savings association must determine the adjusted notional amount of derivative contract, pursuant to paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section, and multiply the adjusted notional amount by each of the supervisory delta adjustment, pursuant to paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section, the maturity factor, pursuant to paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section, and the applicable supervisory factor, as provided in Table 3 to this section.

        (ii)  (A)() For an interest rate derivative contract or a credit derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount equals the product of the notional amount of the derivative contract, as measured in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the calculation, and the supervisory duration, as calculated by the following formula:

        () For purposes of paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(A)() of this section:

        () For an _i_nterest rate derivative contract or credit derivative contract that is a variable notional swap, the notional amount is equal to the time-weighted average of the contractual notional amounts of such a swap over the remaining life of the swap; and

        () For an interest rate derivative contract or a credit derivative contract that is a leveraged swap, in which the notional amount of all legs of the derivative contract are divided by a factor and all rates of the derivative contract are multiplied by the same factor, the notional amount is equal to the notional amount of an equivalent unleveraged swap.

        (B)() For an exchange rate derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount is the notional amount of the non-U.S. denominated currency leg of the derivative contract, as measured in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the calculation. If both legs of the exchange rate derivative contract are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the adjusted notional amount of the derivative contract is the largest leg of the derivative contract, as measured in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the calculation.

        () Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(B)() of this section, for an exchange rate derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the national bank or Federal savings association must set the adjusted notional amount of the derivative contract equal to the notional amount of the derivative contract multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal under the derivative contract.

        (C)() For an equity derivative contract or a commodity derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount is the product of the fair value of one unit of the reference instrument underlying the derivative contract and the number of such units referenced by the derivative contract.

        () Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(C)() of this section, when calculating the adjusted notional amount for an equity derivative contract or a commodity derivative contract that is a volatility derivative contract, the national bank or Federal savings association must replace the unit price with the underlying volatility referenced by the volatility derivative contract and replace the number of units with the notional amount of the volatility derivative contract.

        (iii)  (A) For a derivative contract that is not an option contract or collateralized debt obligation tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is 1 if the fair value of the derivative contract increases when the value of the primary risk factor increases and −1 if the fair value of the derivative contract decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.

        (B)() For a derivative contract that is an option contract, the supervisory delta adjustment is determined by the following formulas, as applicable:

        () As used in the formulas in Table _2_ to this section:

        () Φ _i_s the standard normal cumulative distribution function;

        () P equals the current fair value of the instrument or risk factor, as applicable, underlying the option;

        () K equals the strike price of the option;

        () T equals the number of business days until the latest contractual exercise date of the option;

        () λ equals zero for all deri_v_ative contracts except interest rate options for the currencies where interest rates have negative values. The same value of λ must be used for all interest rate options that are denominated in the same currency. To determine the value of λ for a given currency, a national bank or Federal savings association must find the lowest value _L_ of P and K of all interest rate options in a given currency that the national bank or Federal savings association has with all counterparties. Then, λ is set according to this formula: λ = {− + 0.1%, 0}; and

        () σ equals the super_vi_sory option volatility, as provided in Table 3 to of this section.

        (C)() For a derivative contract that is a collateralized debt obligation tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is determined by the following formula:

        () As used in the formula in paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(C)() of this section:

        () A _i_s the attachment point, which equals the ratio of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures, expressed as a decimal value between zero and one;

        () D is the detachment point, which equals one minus the ratio of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are senior to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures, expressed as a decimal value between zero and one; and

        () The resulting amount is designated with a positive sign if the collateralized debt obligation tranche was purchased by the national bank or Federal savings association and is designated with a negative sign if the collateralized debt obligation tranche was sold by the national bank or Federal savings association.

        (iv)  (A)() The maturity factor of a derivative contract that is subject to a variation margin agreement, excluding derivative contracts that are subject to a variation margin agreement under which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin, is determined by the following formula:

        () Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(9)(iv)(A)() of this section:

        () For a der_i_vative contract that is not a client-facing derivative transaction, MPOR cannot be less than ten business days plus the periodicity of re-margining expressed in business days minus one business day;

        () For a derivative contract that is a client-facing derivative transaction, MPOR cannot be less than five business days plus the periodicity of re-margining expressed in business days minus one business day; and

        () For a derivative contract that is within a netting set that is composed of more than 5,000 derivative contracts that are not cleared transactions, or a netting set that contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or a derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced, MPOR cannot be less than twenty business days.

        () Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(9)(iv)(A)() and () of this section, for a netting set subject to more than two outstanding disputes over margin that lasted longer than the MPOR over the previous two quarters, the applicable floor is twice the amount provided in paragraphs (c)(9)(iv)(A)() and () of this section.

        (B) The maturity factor of a derivative contract that is not subject to a variation margin agreement, or derivative contracts under which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin, is determined by the following formula:

        (C) For purposes of paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section, if a national bank or Federal savings association has elected pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(v) of this section to treat a derivative contract that is a cleared transaction that is not subject to a variation margin agreement as one that is subject to a variation margin agreement, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the derivative contract as subject to a variation margin agreement with maturity factor as determined according to (c)(9)(iv)(A) of this section, and daily settlement does not change the end date of the period referenced by the derivative contract.

        (v)  A national bank or Federal savings association must separate a derivative contract into separate derivative contracts, according to the following rules:

        (A) For an option where the counterparty pays a predetermined amount if the value of the underlying asset is above or below the strike price and nothing otherwise (binary option), the option must be treated as two separate options. For purposes of paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, a binary option with strike K must be represented as the combination of one bought European option and one sold European option of the same type as the original option (put or call) with the strikes set equal to 0.95 * K and 1.05 * K so that the payoff of the binary option is reproduced exactly outside the region between the two strikes. The absolute value of the sum of the adjusted derivative contract amounts of the bought and sold options is capped at the payoff amount of the binary option.

        (B) For a derivative contract that can be represented as a combination of standard option payoffs (such as collar, butterfly spread, calendar spread, straddle, and strangle), a national bank or Federal savings association must treat each standard option component as a separate derivative contract.

        (C) For a derivative contract that includes multiple-payment options, (such as interest rate caps and floors), a national bank or Federal savings association may represent each payment option as a combination of effective single-payment options (such as interest rate caplets and floorlets).

        (D) A national bank or Federal savings association may not decompose linear derivative contracts (such as swaps) into components.

        (10) —(i)  Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(6) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association shall assign a single replacement cost to multiple netting sets that are subject to a single variation margin agreement under which the counterparty must post variation margin, calculated according to the following formula:

        (ii)  Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association shall assign a single potential future exposure to multiple netting sets that are subject to a single variation margin agreement under which the counterparty must post variation margin equal to the sum of the potential future exposure of each such netting set, each calculated according to paragraph (c)(7) of this section as if such nettings sets were not subject to a variation margin agreement.

        (11) —(i)  To calculate replacement cost for either a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements under which the counterparty to each variation margin agreement must post variation margin, or a netting set composed of at least one derivative contract subject to variation margin agreement under which the counterparty must post variation margin and at least one derivative contract that is not subject to such a variation margin agreement, the calculation for replacement cost is provided under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, except that the variation margin threshold equals the sum of the variation margin thresholds of all variation margin agreements within the netting set and the minimum transfer amount equals the sum of the minimum transfer amounts of all the variation margin agreements within the netting set.

        (ii)  (A) To calculate potential future exposure for a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements under which the counterparty to each variation margin agreement must post variation margin, or a netting set composed of at least one derivative contract subject to variation margin agreement under which the counterparty to the derivative contract must post variation margin and at least one derivative contract that is not subject to such a variation margin agreement, a national bank or Federal savings association must divide the netting set into sub-netting sets (as described in paragraph (c)(11)(ii)(B) of this section) and calculate the aggregated amount for each sub-netting set. The aggregated amount for the netting set is calculated as the sum of the aggregated amounts for the sub-netting sets. The multiplier is calculated for the entire netting set.

        (B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(11)(ii)(A) of this section, the netting set must be divided into sub-netting sets as follows:

        () All derivative contracts within the netting set that are not subject to a variation margin agreement or that are subject to a variation margin agreement under which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin form a single sub-netting set. The aggregated amount for this sub-netting set is calculated as if the netting set is not subject to a variation margin agreement.

        () All derivative contracts within the netting set that are subject to variation margin agreements in which the counterparty must post variation margin and that share the same value of the MPOR form a single sub-netting set. The aggregated amount for this sub-netting set is calculated as if the netting set is subject to a variation margin agreement, using the MPOR value shared by the derivative contracts within the netting set.

        (d)  (1)(i) With prior written approval from the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may use the internal models methodology in this paragraph (d) to determine EAD for counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts (collateralized or uncollateralized) and single-product netting sets thereof, for eligible margin loans and single-product netting sets thereof, and for repo-style transactions and single-product netting sets thereof.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that uses the internal models methodology for a particular transaction type (derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for all transactions of that transaction type. A national bank or Federal savings association may choose to use the internal models methodology for one or two of these three types of exposures and not the other types.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association may also use the internal models methodology for derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, and repo-style transactions subject to a qualifying cross-product netting agreement if:

        (A) The national bank or Federal savings association effectively integrates the risk mitigating effects of cross-product netting into its risk management and other information technology systems; and

        (B) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains the prior written approval of the OCC.

        (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association that uses the internal models methodology for a transaction type must receive approval from the OCC to cease using the methodology for that transaction type or to make a material change to its internal model.

        (2)  Under the IMM, a national bank or Federal savings association uses an internal model to estimate the expected exposure (EE) for a netting set and then calculates EAD based on that EE. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate two EEs and two EADs (one stressed and one unstressed) for each netting set as follows:

        (i) EAD is calculated using an EE estimate based on the most recent data meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section;

        (ii) EAD is calculated using an EE estimate based on a historical period that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties according to paragraph (d)(3)(viii) of this section;

        (iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must use its internal model's probability distribution for changes in the fair value of a netting set that are attributable to changes in market variables to determine EE; and

        (iv) Under the internal models methodology, EAD = Max (0, α × effective EPE − CVA), or, subject to the prior written approval of OCC as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, a more conservative measure of EAD.

        (A) CVA equals the credit valuation adjustment that the national bank or Federal savings association has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (d), CVA does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.

        (C) α = 1.4 except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or when the OCC has determined that the national bank or Federal savings association must set α higher based on the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific characteristics of counterparty credit risk or model performance.

        (v) A national bank or Federal savings association may include financial collateral currently posted by the counterparty as collateral (but may not include other forms of collateral) when calculating EE.

        (vi) If a national bank or Federal savings association hedges some or all of the counterparty credit risk associated with a netting set using an eligible credit derivative, the national bank or Federal savings association may take the reduction in exposure to the counterparty into account when estimating EE. If the national bank or Federal savings association recognizes this reduction in exposure to the counterparty in its estimate of EE, it must also use its internal model to estimate a separate EAD for the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the protection provider of the credit derivative.

        (3)  To obtain OCC approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the following minimum standards, with which the national bank or Federal savings association must maintain compliance:

        (i) The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);

        (ii) The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set;

        (iii) The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;

        (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set;

        (v) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The national bank or Federal savings association must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements;

        (vi) The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. The procedures must include stress testing and scenario analysis;

        (vii) The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. The national bank or Federal savings association must estimate model parameters using historical data from the most recent three-year period and update the data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The national bank or Federal savings association should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate;

        (viii) When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, the national bank or Federal savings association must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio. The OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;

        (ix) A national bank or Federal savings association must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the national bank or Federal savings association must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;

        (x) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and

        (xi) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a comprehensive stress testing program that captures all credit exposures to counterparties, and incorporates stress testing of principal market risk factors and creditworthiness of counterparties.

        (4)  (i) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is greater than one year, the national bank or Federal savings association must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to the lower of five years or M(EPE), where:

        (ii) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is one year or less, the national bank or Federal savings association must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to one year, except as provided in § 3.131(d)(7).

        (iii) Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment may use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M(EPE) in place of the formula in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.

        (5)  A national bank or Federal savings association may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases, but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:

        (i) With prior written approval from the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The national bank or Federal savings association may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral, plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is set according to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or

        (ii) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:

        (A) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:

        () The current exposure of the netting set reflecting all collateral held or posted by the national bank or Federal savings association excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or

        () The largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. For purposes of this section, the add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure over the margin period of risk (set in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section); or

        (B) Effective EPE without a collateral agreement plus any collateral the national bank or Federal savings association posts to the counterparty that exceeds the required margin amount.

        (iii) For purposes of this part, including paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the margin period of risk for a netting set subject to a collateral agreement is:

        (A) Five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily remargining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement, or

        (B) Twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter (except if the national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 3.133) or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the national bank or Federal savings association must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set. If the periodicity of the receipt of collateral is N-days, the minimum margin period of risk is the minimum margin period of risk under this paragraph (d) plus N minus 1. This period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.

        (C) Five business days for an OTC derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the national bank or Federal savings association is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the national bank or Federal savings association provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client. A national bank or Federal savings association must use a longer holding period if the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a longer period is appropriate. Additionally, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to set a longer holding period if the OCC determines that a longer period is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction.

        (6)  With prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the national bank or Federal savings association must meet the following minimum standards to the satisfaction of the OCC:

        (i) The national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimate of alpha must capture in the numerator the effects of:

        (A) The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of fair values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across counterparties;

        (B) Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and

        (C) The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a concentration in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is driven by a particular risk factor).

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.

        (iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.

        (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.

        (7)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine if a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, bond option, or equity derivative contract or purchased credit derivative to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies the internal models methodology under this paragraph (d) has specific wrong-way risk. If a transaction has specific wrong-way risk, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the transaction as its own netting set and exclude it from the model described in § 3.132(d)(2) and instead calculate the risk-based capital requirement for the transaction as follows:

        (i) For an equity derivative contract, by multiplying:

        (A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by

        (B) The maximum amount the national bank or Federal savings association could lose on the equity derivative.

        (ii) For a purchased credit derivative by multiplying:

        (A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by

        (B) The fair value of the reference asset of the credit derivative.

        (iii) For a bond option, by multiplying:

        (A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by

        (B) The smaller of the notional amount of the underlying reference asset and the maximum potential loss under the bond option contract.

        (iv) For a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan by multiplying:

        (A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by

        (B) The EAD of the transa_c_tion determined according to the EAD equation in § 3.132(b)(2), substituting the estimated value of the collateral assuming a default of the counterparty for the value of the collateral in Σ of the equation.

        (8)  The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk is the sum of a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for purchased credit derivatives that are not bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for equity derivatives with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of this section, and a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iv) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.

        (9)  (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD of the netting set to obtain the **unstressed** capital requirement for each netting set. A national bank or Federal savings association that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(3) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the unstressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each wholesale obligor and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD of the netting set to obtain the **stressed** capital requirement for each netting set. A national bank or Federal savings association that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(6) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the stressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K.

        (iii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's dollar risk-based capital requirement under the internal models methodology equals the larger of K and K. A national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted assets amount for IMM exposures is equal to the capital requirement multiplied by 12.5, plus risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk in paragraph (d)(8) of this section and those in paragraph (d)(10) of this section.

        (10)  (i) With prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may set EAD equal to a measure of counterparty credit risk exposure, such as peak EAD, that is more conservative than an alpha of 1.4 times the larger of EPE and EPE for every counterparty whose EAD will be measured under the alternative measure of counterparty exposure. The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure used for EAD. With respect to paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section:

        (A) For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products, the national bank or Federal savings association may assume that the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section for a period not to exceed 180 days.

        (B) For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the national bank or Federal savings association generally may assume that the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section.

        (ii) To calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of the approach in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131, multiply the output of the formula by the EAD for the exposure as specified above, and multiply by 12.5.

        (e) —(1)  With respect to its OTC derivative contracts, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a CVA risk-weighted asset amount for its portfolio of OTC derivative transactions that are subject to the CVA capital requirement using the simple CVA approach described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section or, with prior written approval of the OCC, the advanced CVA approach described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. A national bank or Federal savings association that receives prior OCC approval to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amounts for a class of counterparties using the advanced CVA approach must continue to use that approach for that class of counterparties until it notifies the OCC in writing that the national bank or Federal savings association expects to begin calculating its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach. Such notice must include an explanation of the national bank's or Federal savings association's rationale and the date upon which the national bank or Federal savings association will begin to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach.

        (2)  Notwithstanding the prior approval requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a market risk national bank or Federal savings association may calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the advanced CVA approach if the national bank or Federal savings association has OCC approval to:

        (i) Determine EAD for OTC derivative contracts using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section; and

        (ii) Determine its specific risk add-on for debt positions issued by the counterparty using a specific risk model described in § 3.207(b).

        (3)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize a single name CDS, single name contingent CDS, any other equivalent hedging instrument that references the counterparty directly, and *ind*ex credit default swaps (CDS) as a CVA hedge under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section or paragraph (e)(6) of this section, provided that the position is managed as a CVA hedge in accordance with the national bank's or Federal savings association's hedging policies.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association shall not recognize as a CVA hedge any tranched or n-to-default credit derivative.

        (4)  Total *CVA* risk-weighted assets is the CVA capital requirement, K, calculated for a national bank's or Federal savings association's entire portfolio of OTC derivative counterparties that are subject to the CVA capital requirement, multiplied by 12.5.

        (5)  (i) Under the simple *CVA* approach, the CVA capital requirement, K, is calculated according to the following formula:

        (A)  = the _w_e*_i_*ght applicable to counterparty  under Table 4 to this section;

        (B)  = the EAD-we*_i_*ghted average of the effective maturity of each netting set with counterparty  (where each netting set's effective maturity can be no less than one year.)

        (C)  = the sum of the ____EAD____ for all nett*****_i_*****ng sets of OTC derivative contracts with counterparty  calculated using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk methodology described in paragraph (c) of this section or the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. When the national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD under paragraph (c) of this section, such EAD may be adjusted for purposes of calculating  by multiplying EAD by (1-exp(−0.05 × ))/(0.05 × ), where “exp” is the exponential function. When the national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD under paragraph (d) of this section,  equals .

        (D)  = the not*i*onal weighted average maturity of the *hedge* instrument.

        (E)  = the sum of the not***__i__***onal amounts of any purchased single name CDS referencing counterparty  that is used to **hedge** CVA risk to counterparty  multiplied by (1-exp(−0.05 × ))/(0.05 × ).

        (F)  = the maturity of the CDS or the notional weighted average maturity of any CDS purchased to hedge CVA risk of counterparty

        (G)  = the not_i_onal amount of one or more CDS purchased to hedge CVA risk for counterparty  multiplied by (1-exp(−0.05 × ))/(0.05 × )

        (H)  = the _w_eight applicable to the CDS based on the average weight of the underlying reference names that comprise the **ind**ex under Table 4 to this section.

        (***_i_***i) The national bank or Federal savings association may treat the notional amount of the *ind*ex attributable to a counterparty as a single name hedge of counterparty  (,) when calculating K, and subtract the notional amount of  from the notional amount of the CDS A national bank or Federal savings association must treat the CDS hedge with the notional amount reduced by  as a *CVA* hedge.

        (6)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may use the VaR model that it uses to determine specific risk under § 3.207(b) or another VaR model that meets the quantitative requirements of §§ 3.205(b) and 3.207(b)(1) to calculate its CVA capital requirement for a counterparty by modeling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads, together with any recognized CVA hedges, on the CVA for the counterparties, subject to the following requirements:

        (A) The VaR model must incorporate only changes in the counterparties' credit spreads, not changes in other risk factors. The VaR model does not need to capture jump-to-default risk;

        (B) A national bank or Federal savings association that qualifies to use the advanced CVA approach must include in that approach any immaterial OTC derivative portfolios for which it uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk methodology in paragraph (c) of this section according to paragraph (e)(6)(viii) of this section; and

        (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must have the systems capability to calculate the CVA capital requirement for a counterparty on a daily basis (but is not required to calculate the CVA capital requirement on a daily basis).

        (ii) Under the advanced *CVA* approach, the CVA capital requirement, K, is calculated according to the following formulas:

        (A)  = __t__he t*_i_*me of the -th revaluation time bucket starting from  = *0*.

        (B)  = _t_he longest contractual maturity across the O*T*C derivative contracts with the counterparty.

        (C)  = _t_he CDS _s_pread for the counterparty at tenor  used to calculate the CVA for the counterparty. If a CDS spread **i**s not available, the national bank or Federal savings association must use a proxy spread based on the credit quality, industry and region of the counterparty.

        (D)  = the loss given default of the counterparty based on the spread of a publicly traded debt instrument of the counterparty, or, where a publicly traded debt instrument spread is not available, a proxy spread based on the credit quality, industry, and region of the counterparty. Where no market information and no reliable proxy based on the credit quality, industry, and region of the counterparty are available to determine _LGD_, a national bank or Federal savings association may use a conservative estimate when determining LGD, subject to approval by the OCC.

        (E)  = _t_he sum of the expected exposures for all nett**i**ng sets with the counterparty at revaluation time , calculated according to paragraphs (e)(6)(iv)(A) and (e)(6)(v)(A) of this section.

        (F)  = _t_he r**i**sk-free discount factor at time , where  = 1.

        (G) Exp is the exponential function.

        (H) The subscript j refers either to a stressed or an unstressed calibration as described in paragraphs (e)(6)(iv) and (v) of this section.

        (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must use the formulas in paragraphs (e)(6)(iii)(A) or (e)(6)(iii)(B) of this section to calculate credit spread sensitivities if its VaR model is not based on full repricing.

        (A) If the VaR model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate each credit spread sensitivity according to the following formula:

        (iv) To calculate the  measure for purposes of paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must:

        (A) Use the  calculated us*i*ng the calibration of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section, except as provided in § 3.132(e)(6)(vi), and

        (B) Use the historical observation period required under § 3.205(b)(2).

        (v) To calculate the  measure for purposes of paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must:

        (A) Use the  calculated us*i*ng the stress calibration in paragraph (d)(3)(viii) of this section except as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(vi) of this section.

        (B) Cal*i*brate VaR model inputs to historical data from the most severe twelve-month stress period contained within the three-year stress period used to calculate . The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the  measure.

        (v*i*) If a national bank or Federal savings association captures the effect of a collateral agreement on EAD using the method described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate  using the method in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section and keep that _EE_ constant with the maturity equal to the maximum of:

        (A) Half of the longest maturity of a transaction in the netting set, and

        (B) The notional weighted average maturity of all transactions in the netting set.

        (vii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR model must capture the basis between the spreads of any CDS that is used as the hedging instrument and the hedged counterparty exposure over various time periods, including benign and stressed environments. If the VaR model does not capture that basis, the national bank or Federal savings association must reflect only 50 percent of the notional amount of the CDS hedge in the VaR model.

        (viii) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to calculate the EAD for any immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the national bank or Federal savings association must use that EAD as a constant EE in the formula for the calculation of CVA with the maturity equal to the maximum of:

        (A) Half of the longest maturity of a transaction in the netting set; and

        (B) The notional weighted average maturity of all transactions in the netting set.

        § 3.133   Cleared transactions.

#### § § 3.133

        (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member client must use the methodologies described in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate risk-weighted assets for a cleared transaction.

        (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member must use the methodologies described in paragraph (c) of this section to calculate its risk-weighted assets for a cleared transaction and paragraph (d) of this section to calculate its risk-weighted assets for its default fund contribution to a CCP.

        (b) —(1)  (i) To determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a cleared transaction, a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member client must multiply the trade exposure amount for the cleared transaction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (ii) A clearing member client national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all of its cleared transactions.

        (2)  (i) For a cleared transaction that is a derivative contract or a netting set of derivative contracts, trade exposure amount equals the EAD for the derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts calculated using the methodology used to calculate EAD for derivative contracts set forth in § 3.132(c) or (d), plus the fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association and held by the CCP or a clearing member in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote. When the national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD for the cleared transaction using the methodology in § 3.132(d), EAD equals EAD.

        (ii) For a cleared transaction that is a repo-style transaction or netting set of repo-style transactions, trade exposure amount equals the EAD for the repo-style transaction calculated using the methodology set forth in § 3.132(b)(2) or (3) or (d), plus the fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association and held by the CCP or a clearing member in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote. When the national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD for the cleared transaction under § 3.132(d), EAD equals EAD.

        (3)  (i) For a cleared transaction with a QCCP, a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association must apply a risk weight of:

        (A) 2 percent if the collateral posted by the national bank or Federal savings association to the QCCP or clearing member is subject to an arrangement that prevents any loss to the clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association due to the joint default or a concurrent insolvency, liquidation, or receivership proceeding of the clearing member and any other clearing member clients of the clearing member; and the clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association has conducted sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from an event of default or from liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceedings) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions.

        (B) 4 percent, if the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section are not met.

        (ii) For a cleared transaction with a CCP that is not a QCCP, a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association must apply the risk weight applicable to the CCP under subpart D of this part.

        (4)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this section, collateral posted by a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association that is held by a custodian (in its capacity as a custodian) in a manner that is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, clearing member, and other clearing member clients of the clearing member, is not subject to a capital requirement under this section.

        (ii) A clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member or a custodian in connection with a cleared transaction in accordance with requirements under subparts E or F of this part, as applicable.

        (c) —(1)  (i) To determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a cleared transaction, a clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the trade exposure amount for the cleared transaction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (ii) A clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all of its cleared transactions.

        (2)  A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its trade exposure amount for a cleared transaction as follows:

        (i) For a cleared transaction that is a derivative contract or a netting set of derivative contracts, trade exposure amount equals the EAD calculated using the methodology used to calculate EAD for derivative contracts set forth in § 3.132(c) or (d), plus the fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association and held by the CCP in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote. When the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD for the cleared transaction using the methodology in § 3.132(d), EAD equals EAD.

        (ii) For a cleared transaction that is a repo-style transaction or netting set of repo-style transactions, trade exposure amount equals the EAD calculated under § 3.132(b)(2) or (3) or (d), plus the fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association and held by the CCP in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote. When the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association calculates EAD for the cleared transaction under § 3.132(d), EAD equals EAD.

        (3)  (i) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must apply a risk weight of 2 percent to the trade exposure amount for a cleared transaction with a QCCP.

        (ii) For a cleared transaction with a CCP that is not a QCCP, a clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must apply the risk weight applicable to the CCP according to subpart D of this part.

        (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, a clearing member national bank or Federal savings association may apply a risk weight of zero percent to the trade exposure amount for a cleared transaction with a QCCP where the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association is acting as a financial intermediary on behalf of a clearing member client, the transaction offsets another transaction that satisfies the requirements set forth in § 3.3(a), and the clearing member national bank or Federal savings association is not obligated to reimburse the clearing member client in the event of the QCCP default.

        (4)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this section, collateral posted by a clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that is held by a custodian (in its capacity as a custodian) in a manner that is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, clearing member, and other clearing member clients of the clearing member, is not subject to a capital requirement under this section.

        (ii) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member or a custodian in connection with a cleared transaction in accordance with requirements under subparts E or F of this part, as applicable

        (d) —(1)  A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a CCP at least quarterly, or more frequently if, in the opinion of the national bank or Federal savings association or the OCC, there is a material change in the financial condition of the CCP.

        (2)  A clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to CCPs that are not QCCPs equals the sum of such default fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 percent, or an amount determined by the OCC, based on factors such as size, structure, and membership characteristics of the CCP and riskiness of its transactions, in cases where such default fund contributions may be unlimited.

        (3)  A clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to QCCPs equals the sum of its capital requirement, K for each QCCP, as calculated under the methodology set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.

        (4)  A clearing member national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirement for its default fund contribution to a QCCP () is equal to:

        (5)  Where a Q***CCP*** has provided its _K_, a national bank or Federal savings association must rely on such disclosed figure instead of calculating K under this paragraph (d)(5), unless the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a more conservative figure is appropriate based on the nature, structure, or characteristics of the QCCP. The hypothetical capital requirement of a QCCP (), as determined by the national bank or Federal savings association, is equal to:

        (6)  (i) The EAD of a QCCP to a clearing member is equal to the sum of the EAD for derivative contracts determined under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section and the EAD for repo-style transactions determined under paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section.

        (ii) With respect to any derivative contracts between the QCCP and the clearing member that are cleared transactions and any guarantees that the clearing member has provided to the QCCP with respect to performance of a clearing member client on a derivative contract, the EAD is equal to the exposure amount of the QCCP to the clearing member for all such derivative contracts and guarantees of derivative contracts calculated under SA-CCR in § 3.132(c) (or, with respect to a QCCP located outside the United States, under a substantially identical methodology in effect in the jurisdiction) using a value of 10 business days for purposes of § 3.132(c)(9)(iv); less the value of all collateral held by the QCCP posted by the clearing member or a client of the clearing member in connection with a derivative contract for which the clearing member has provided a guarantee to the QCCP and the amount of the prefunded default fund contribution of the clearing member to the QCCP.

        (iii) With respect to any repo-style transactions between the QCCP and a clearing member that are cleared transactions, EAD is equal to:

        (iv) EAD must be calculated separately for each clearing member's sub-client accounts and sub-house account ( for the clearing member's proprietary activities). If the clearing member's collateral and its client's collateral are held in the same default fund contribution account, then the EAD of that account is the sum of the EAD for the client-related transactions within the account and the EAD of the house-related transactions within the account. For purposes of determining such EADs, the independent collateral of the clearing member and its client must be allocated in proportion to the respective total amount of independent collateral posted by the clearing member to the QCCP.

        (v) If any account or sub-account contains both derivative contracts and repo-style transactions, the EAD of that account is the sum of the EAD for the derivative contracts within the account and the EAD of the repo-style transactions within the account. If independent collateral is held for an account containing both derivative contracts and repo-style transactions, then such collateral must be allocated to the derivative contracts and repo-style transactions in proportion to the respective product specific exposure amounts, calculated, excluding the effects of collateral, according to § 3.132(b) for repo-style transactions and to § 3.132(c)(5) for derivative contracts.

        (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (d) of this section, with the prior approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a QCCP according to § 3.35(d)(3)(ii).

        § 3.134   Guarantees and credit derivatives: PD substitution and LGD adjustment approaches.

#### § § 3.134

        (a)  (1) This section applies to wholesale exposures for which:

        (i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or

        (ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the national bank or Federal savings association and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.

        (2) Wholesale exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) are securitization exposures subject to §§ 3.141 through 3.145.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association may elect to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covering an exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by using the PD substitution approach or the LGD adjustment approach in paragraph (c) of this section or, if the transaction qualifies, using the double default treatment in § 3.135. A national bank's or Federal savings association's PD and LGD for the hedged exposure may not be lower than the PD and LGD floors described in § 3.131(d)(2) and (d)(3).

        (4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged wholesale exposures described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (6) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the same risk parameters for calculating ECL as it uses for calculating the risk-based capital requirement for the exposure.

        (b)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:

        (i) The reference exposure ranks  (that is, equally) with or is junior to the hedged exposure; and

        (ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are exposures to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to assure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligor fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.

        (c) —(1) —(i)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure by substituting the PD associated with the rating grade of the protection provider for the PD associated with the rating grade of the obligor in the risk-based capital formula applicable to the guarantee or credit derivative in Table 1 of § 3.131 and using the appropriate LGD as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that full substitution of the protection provider's PD leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the national bank or Federal savings association may substitute a higher PD than that of the protection provider.

        (ii)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and P of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.

        (A) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the protection provider's PD, LGD is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and EAD is P. If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that full substitution leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the national bank or Federal savings association may use a higher PD than that of the protection provider.

        (B) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.

        (C) The treatment in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is applicable when the credit risk of a wholesale exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis or when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.

        (iii)  The LGD of a hedged exposure under the PD substitution approach is equal to:

        (A) The lower of the LGD of the hedged exposure (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative) and the LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative provides the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection; or

        (B) The LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative does not provide the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection.

        (2) —(i)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure is the greater of:

        (A) The risk-based capital requirement for the exposure as calculated under § 3.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative; or

        (B) The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the protection provider as calculated under § 3.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure.

        (ii)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.

        (A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure would be the greater of:

        () The risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure as calculated under § 3._1_31, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative and EAD set equal to P; or

        () The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the guarantor as calculated under § 3.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD set equal to P.

        (B) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.

        (3)  For purposes of this paragraph (c), the M of the hedged exposure is the same as the M of the exposure if it were unhedged.

        (d)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining its risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.

        (2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).

        (3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the national bank or Federal savings association to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.

        (4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.

        (5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant:

        (i) P = effective notional a*m*ount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;

        (ii) E = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant;

        (iii) t = the lesser of T or the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant, expressed in years; and

        (iv) T = the lesser of five or the residual maturity of the hedged exposure, expressed in years.

        (e)  If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit derivative:

        (1) P = effective notional amount of the c*r*edit risk mitigant, adjusted for lack of restructuring event (and maturity mismatch, if applicable); and

        (2) P = effective notional a*m*ount of the credit risk mitigant adjusted for maturity mismatch (if applicable).

        (f)  (1) If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative:

        (i) P = effe*c*tive notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);

        (ii) P = effective notional amount of the c*r*edit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and

        (iii) H = haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must set H equal to 8 percent unless it qualifies for the use of and uses its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility based on a ten-business-day holding period and daily marking-to-market and remargining. A national bank or Federal savings association qualifies for the use of its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility if it qualifies for:

        (i) The own-estimates haircuts in § 3.132(b)(2)(iii);

        (ii) The simple VaR methodology in § 3.132(b)(3); or

        (iii) The internal models methodology in § 3.132(d).

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust H calculated in paragraph (f)(_2_) of this section upward if the national bank or Federal savings association revalues the guarantee or credit derivative less frequently than once every ten business days using the square root of time formula provided in § 3.132(b)(2)(iii)(A)().

        § 3.135   Guarantees and credit derivatives: double default treatment.

#### § § 3.135

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of a guarantee or credit derivative covering an exposure described in § 3.134(a)(1) by applying the double default treatment in this section if all the following criteria are satisfied:

        (1) The hedged exposure is fully covered or covered on a pro rata basis by:

        (i) An eligible guarantee issued by an eligible double default guarantor; or

        (ii) An eligible credit derivative that meets the requirements of § 3.134(b)(2) and that is issued by an eligible double default guarantor.

        (2) The guarantee or credit derivative is:

        (i) An uncollateralized guarantee or uncollateralized credit derivative (for example, a credit default swap) that provides protection with respect to a single reference obligor; or

        (ii) An n-to-default credit derivative (subject to *th*e requirements of § 3.142(m).

        (3) The hedged exposure is a wholesale exposure (other than a sovereign exposure).

        (4) The obligor of the hedged exposure is not:

        (i) An eligible double default guarantor or an affiliate of an eligible double default guarantor; or

        (ii) An affiliate of the guarantor.

        (5) The national bank or Federal savings association does not recognize any credit risk mitigation benefits of the guarantee or credit derivative for the hedged exposure other than through application of the double default treatment as provided in this section.

        (6) The national bank or Federal savings association has implemented a process (which has received the prior, written approval of the OCC) to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of the obligor of the hedged exposure and the protection provider. If excessive correlation is present, the national bank or Federal savings association may not use the double default treatment for the hedged exposure.

        (b)  If a transaction meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is at least equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association may determine its risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure under paragraph (e) of this section.

        (c)  If a transaction meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize double default treatment on the protected portion of the exposure:

        (1) For the protected exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must set EAD equal to P and calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (2) For the unprotected exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must set EAD equal to the EAD of the original exposure minus P and then calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in § 3.131.

        (d)  For any hedged exposure to which a national bank or Federal savings association applies double default treatment under this part, the national bank or Federal savings association must make applicable adjustments to the protection amount as required in § 3.134(d), (e), and (f).

        (e)  The dollar risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure to which a national bank or Federal savings association has applied double default treatment is K multiplied by the EAD of the exposure. K is calculated according to the following formula:

        (1)

        (2) PD = PD of the protection provider.

        (3) PD = PD *o*f the obligor of the hedged exposure.

        (4) LGD =

        (i) The lower of the LGD of the hedged exposure (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative) and the LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative provides the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout on triggering the protection; or

        (ii) The LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative does not provide the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout on triggering the protection; and

        (5) ρ (asset value c*o*rrelation of the obligor) is calculated according to the appropriate formula for (R) provided in Table 1 in § 3.131, with PD equal to PD.

        (6) b (maturity adjustment c*o*efficient) is calculated accordin*g* to the formula for b provided in Table 1 in § 3.131, with PD equal to the lesser of PD and PD; and

        (7) M (maturity) is the effective maturity of the guarantee or credit derivative, which may not be less than one year or greater than five years.

        § 3.136   Unsettled transactions.

#### § § 3.136

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        (1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.

        (2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.

        (3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.

        (4) The positive current exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the counterparty.

        (b)  This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:

        (1) Cleared transactions that are subject to daily marking-to-market and daily receipt and payment of variation margin;

        (2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions (which are addressed in §§ 3.131 and 132);

        (3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts (which are addressed in §§ 3. 131 and 132); or

        (4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts and addressed in §§ 3.131 and 132).

        (c)  In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement or clearing system, or a central counterparty, the OCC may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.

        (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the national bank or Federal savings association by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 3.136.

        (e)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank or Federal savings association has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The national bank or Federal savings association must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the national bank or Federal savings association has received its corresponding deliverables.

        (2) From the business day after the national bank or Federal savings association has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association as a wholesale exposure.

        (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may use a 45 percent LGD for the transaction rather than estimating LGD for the transaction provided the national bank or Federal savings association uses the 45 percent LGD for all transactions described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association may use a 100 percent risk weight for the transaction provided the national bank or Federal savings association uses this risk weight for all transactions described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (3) If the national bank or Federal savings association has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after the counterparty delivery was due, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the national bank or Federal savings association.

        (f)  Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.

        §§ 3.137-3.140   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 3.137-3.140

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures

        § 3.141   Operational criteria for recognizing the transfer of risk.

#### § § 3.141

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (a) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:

        (1) The exposures are not reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;

        (3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and

        (4) The securitization does not:

        (i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and

        (ii) Contain an early amortization provision.

        (b)  For synthetic securitizations, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must hold risk-based capital under this subpart against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:

        (1) The credit risk mitigant is:

        (i) Financial collateral; or

        (ii) A guarantee that meets all of the requirements of an eligible guarantee in § 3.2 except for paragraph (3) of the definition; or

        (iii) A credit derivative that meets all of the requirements of an eligible credit derivative except for paragraph (3) of the definition of eligible guarantee in § 3.2.

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:

        (i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (ii) Require the national bank or Federal savings association to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (iii) Increase the national bank's or Federal savings association's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

        (iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the national bank or Federal savings association in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or

        (v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the national bank or Federal savings association after the inception of the securitization;

        (3) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and

        (4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.

        (c)  (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 3.142(k), if a national bank or Federal savings association is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the securitization exposure. The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the position in relation to regulatory capital according to this part.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:

        (i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:

        (A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the position, and deal-specific definitions of default;

        (B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);

        (C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and

        (D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and

        (ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under this section for each securitization exposure.

        § 3.142   Risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.

#### § § 3.142

        (a)  Except as provided elsewhere in this section and in § 3.141:

        (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute after tax gain-on-sale;

        (2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the supervisory formula approach in § 3.143 to the exposure if the national bank or Federal savings association and the exposure qualify for the supervisory formula approach according to § 3.143(a);

        (3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach, the national bank or Federal savings association may apply the simplified supervisory formula approach under § 3.144;

        (4) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in § 3.143, and the national bank or Federal savings association does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 3.144, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure; and

        (5) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by a national bank or Federal savings association in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), a national bank or Federal savings association may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (e) of this section rather than apply the hierarchy of approaches described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

        (b)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures is equal to the sum of its risk-weighted assets calculated using §§ 3.141 through 146.

        (c)  A national bank or Federal savings association may calculate any deduction from common equity tier 1 capital for a securitization exposure net of any DTLs associated with the securitization exposure.

        (d)  Except as provided in § 3.141(c), unless one or more underlying exposures does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, securitization, or equity exposure, the total risk-based capital requirement for all securitization exposures held by a single national bank or Federal savings association associated with a single securitization (excluding any risk-based capital requirements that relate to the national bank's or Federal savings association's gain-on-sale or CEIOs associated with the securitization) may not exceed the sum of:

        (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart as if the national bank or Federal savings association directly held the underlying exposures; and

        (2) The total ECL of the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart.

        (e)  (1) The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction is the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance-sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the national bank or Federal savings association could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).

        (3) The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative) is the EAD of the exposure as calculated in § 3.132 or § 3.133.

        (f)  If a national bank or Federal savings association has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage of the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when a national bank or Federal savings association provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the national bank or Federal savings association may assign to the overlapping securitization exposure the applicable risk-based capital treatment under this subpart that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.

        (g)  Except as provided in § 3.141(c), if a national bank or Federal savings association has a securitization exposure where any underlying exposure is not a wholesale exposure, retail exposure, securitization exposure, or equity exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association:

        (1) Must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute gain-on-sale, if the national bank or Federal savings association is an originating national bank or Federal savings association;

        (2) May apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 3.144 to the exposure, if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section;

        (3) Must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in § 3.143, and the national bank or Federal savings association does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 3.144 to the exposure.

        (h)  If a national bank or Federal savings association provides support to a securitization in excess of the national bank's or Federal savings association's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):

        (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and

        (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must disclose publicly:

        (i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and

        (ii) The regulatory capital impact to the national bank or Federal savings association of providing such implicit support.

        (i)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.

        (2) For a national bank or Federal savings association that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the national bank or Federal savings association may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.

        (j)  Regardless of any other provisions in this part, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.

        (k)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart E, a national bank or Federal savings association that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only the contractual amount of retained recourse if all the following conditions are met:

        (i) The transaction is a sale under GAAP.

        (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the national bank's or Federal savings association's reasonably estimated liability under the recourse arrangement.

        (iii) The loans and leases are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 ); and

        (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association is well-capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 6.4. For purposes of determining whether a national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (k), the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.

        (2) The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a national bank or Federal savings association on transfers of small-business obligations subject to paragraph (k)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.

        (3) If a national bank or Federal savings association ceases to be well capitalized or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the preferential capital treatment specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with recourse that occurred during the time that the national bank or Federal savings association was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.

        (4) The risk-based capital ratios of a national bank or Federal savings association must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.

        (l) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine a risk weight using ***th***e supervisory formula approach (SFA) pursuant to § 3.143 or the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) pursuant to § 3.144 for an n-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (l). In the case of credit protection sold, a national bank or Federal savings association must determine its exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.

        (2) For purposes of determining *th*e risk weight for an n-to-default credit derivative using the SFA or the SSFA, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:

        (i) The attachment point (parameter A) is *th*e ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the risk weight for its exposure in an n-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to the credit enhancement level (L) input to the SFA formula. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) risk-weighted asset amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure.

        (ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals *th*e sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of the SFA, parameter D must be set to equal L plus the thickness of tranche T input to the SFA formula.

        (3) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at does not use the SFA or the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its exposure in an n-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.

        (4) —(i)  A national bank or Federal savings association that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 3.134(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement under this subpart for the underlying exposures as if the national bank or Federal savings association synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the lowest risk-based capital requirement and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 3.132 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 3.134(b).

        (ii)  (A) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a n-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 3.134(b) (other than a first-to-default credit derivative) may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of the derivative only if:

        () The national bank or Federal savings association also has obtained credit protection on the same underlying exposures in the form of first-through-(n-_1_)-to-default credit derivatives; or

        () If n-1 of the underlying exposures have already defaulted.

        (B) If a national bank or Federal savings association satisfies *th*e requirements of paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the bank had only synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the n smallest risk-based capital requirement and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures.

        (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 3.132 for a n-to-default credit derivative *th*at does not meet the rules of recognition of § 3.134(b).

        (m) —(1)  For a guarantee or credit derivative (o**th**er than an n-to-default credit derivative) provided by a national bank or Federal savings association that covers the full amount or a pro rata share of a securitization exposure's principal and interest, the national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight the guarantee or credit derivative as if it holds the portion of the reference exposure covered by the guarantee or credit derivative.

        (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at purchases an OTC credit derivative (other than an n-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 3.145 as a credit risk mitigant (including via recognized collateral) is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 3.131 in accordance with § 3.132(c)(3).

        (ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association cannot, or chooses not to, recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under § 3.145, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative under § 3.132(c).

        (A) If the national bank or Federal savings association purchases credit protection from a counterparty that is not a securitization SPE, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk weight for the exposure according § 3.131.

        (B) If the national bank or Federal savings association purchases the credit protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to this section, including paragraph (a)(5) of this section for a credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments.

        § 3.143   Supervisory formula approach (SFA).

#### § § 3.143

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must use the SFA to determine its risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure if the national bank or Federal savings association can calculate on an ongoing basis each of the SFA parameters in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b)  The risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure equals its SFA risk-based capital requirement as calculated under paragraph (c) and (d) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.

        (c)  (1) If K is greater than or equal to L + T, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement equals the exposure amount.

        (2) If K is less than or equal to L, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:

        (i) F · T (where F is 0.016 for all securitization exposures); or

        (ii) S[L + T]−S[L].

        (3) If K is greater than L and less than L + T, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to an amount equal to UE · TP (K−L), and the exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:

        (i) F · (T−(K−L)) (where F is 0.016 for all other securitization exposures); or

        (ii) S[L + T]−S[K].

        (d)

        (e)  For purposes of the calculations in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:

        (1)  UE is the EAD of any underlying exposures that are wholesale and retail exposures (including the amount of any funded spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, and other similar funded credit enhancements) plus the amount of any underlying exposures that are securitization exposures (as defined in § 3.142(e)) plus the adjusted carrying value of any underlying exposures that are equity exposures (as defined in § 3.151(b)).

        (2) ). TP is the ratio of the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure to the amount of the tranche that contains the securitization exposure.

        (3)  (i) K is the ratio of:

        (A) The sum of the risk-based capital requirements for the underlying exposures plus the expected credit losses of the underlying exposures (as determined under this subpart E as if the underlying exposures were directly held by the national bank or Federal savings association); to

        (B) UE.

        (ii) The calculation of K must reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant applied to the underlying exposures (either to an individual underlying exposure, to a group of underlying exposures, or to all of the underlying exposures).

        (iii) All assets related to the securitization are treated as underlying exposures, including assets in a reserve account (such as a cash collateral account).

        (4)  (i) L is the ratio of:

        (A) The amount of all securitization exposures subordinated to the tranche that contains the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure; to

        (B) UE.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine L before considering the effects of any tranche-specific credit enhancements.

        (iii) Any gain-on-sale or CEIO associated with the securitization may not be included in L.

        (iv) Any reserve account funded by accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the tranche that contains the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the numerator and denominator of L to the extent cash has accumulated in the account. Unfunded reserve accounts (that is, reserve accounts that are to be funded from future cash flows from the underlying exposures) may not be included in the calculation of L.

        (v) In some cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount that provides credit enhancement (for example, first loss protection) for all or certain tranches of the securitization. When this arises, L should be calculated inclusive of this discount if the discount provides credit enhancement for the securitization exposure.

        (5)  T is the ratio of:

        (i) The amount of the tranche that contains the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure; to

        (ii) UE.

        (6)  (i) Unless the national bank or Federal savings association elects to use the formula provided in paragraph (f) of this section,

        (ii) Multiple exposures to one obligor must be treated as a single underlying exposure.

        (iii) In the case of a resecuritization, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat each underlying exposure as a single underlying exposure and must not look through to the originally securitized underlying exposures.

        (7)  EWALGD is calculated as:

        (f)  (1) If all underlying exposures of a securitization are retail exposures, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply the SFA using the following simplifications:

        (i) h = 0; and

        (ii) v = 0.

        (2) Under the conditions in §§ 3.143(f)(3) and (f)(4), a national bank or Federal savings association may employ a simplified method for calculating N and EWALGD.

        (3) If C is no more than 0.03, a national bank or Federal savings association may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = *1* if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, and may set N equal to the following amount:

        (i) C is the ratio of the su*m* of the amounts of the `m' largest underlying exposures to UE; and

        (ii) The level of m is to be selected by the national bank or Federal savings association.

        (4) Alternatively, if only C is available and C is no more than 0.03, the national bank or Federal savings association may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = ***1*** if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure and may set N = 1/C.

        § 3.144   Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA).

#### § § 3.144

        (a)  To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.

        (b)  To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:

        (1) K is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D of this part. K is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K equal to 0.08).

        (2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:

        (i) Ninety days or more past due;

        (ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

        (iii) In the process of foreclosure;

        (iv) Held as real estate owned;

        (v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:

        (A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or

        (B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or

        (vi) Is in default.

        (3) Parameter A is *th*e attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in section 142(l) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

        (4) Parameter D is *th*e detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section 142(l) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are  with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

        (5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.

        (c)  K and W are used to calculate K, the augmented value of K, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters ***A*** and D, relative to K determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a risk weight of 20 percent.

        (1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent;

        (2) When the attachment point, parameter *A*, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;

        (3) When **A** is less than K and D is greater than K, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. For the purpose of this weighted-average calculation:

        § 3.145   Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures.

#### § § 3.145

        (a)  An originating national bank or Federal savings association that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge its securitization exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization that satisfies the operational criteria in § 3.141 may recognize the credit risk mitigant, but only as provided in this section. An investing national bank or Federal savings association that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize the credit risk mitigant, but only as provided in this section.

        (b) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize financial collateral in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure (other than a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, or an OTC derivative contract for which the national bank or Federal savings association has reflected collateral in its determination of exposure amount under § 3.132) as follows. The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralized securitization exposure is equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as calculated under the SSFA in § 3.144 or under the SFA in § 3.143 multiplied by the ratio of adjusted exposure amount (SE*) to original exposure amount (SE),

        (i) SE* = max {0, [SE−C × (1−H−H)]};

        (ii) SE = the amount of the securitization exposure calculated under § 3.142(e);

        (iii) C = the current fair value of the collateral;

        (iv) H = the haircut appropriate to the collateral type; and

        (v) H = the haircut appropriate for any currency mismatch between the collateral and the exposure.

        (3)  Unless a national bank or Federal savings association qualifies for use of and uses own-estimates haircuts in paragraph (b)(4) of this section:

        (i) A national bank or Federal *s*avings association must use the collateral type haircuts (H) in Table 1 to § 3.132 of this subpart;

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must use a currency mismatch haircut (H) of 8 percent if the exposure and the collateral are denominated in different currencies;

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the supervisory haircuts obtained in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section by the square root of 6.5 (which equals 2.549510); and

        (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period longer than 65 business days where and as appropriate to take into account the illiquidity of the collateral.

        (4)  With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts using its own internal estimates of market price volatility and foreign exchange volatility, subject to § 3.132(b)(2)(iii). The minimum holding period (T) for securitization exposures is 65 business days.

        (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure.

        (2)  When a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must also:

        (i) Calculate ECL for the protected portion of the exposure using the same risk parameters that it uses for calculating the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

        (ii) Add the exposure's ECL to the national bank's or Federal savings association's total ECL.

        (3)  A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as follows:

        (i)  If the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative equals or exceeds the amount of the securitization exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association may set the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for a direct exposure to the eligible guarantor (as determined in the wholesale risk weight function described in § 3.131), using the national bank's or Federal savings association's PD for the guarantor, the national bank's or Federal savings association's LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the amount of the securitization exposure (as determined in § 3.142(e)).

        (ii)  If the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative is less than the amount of the securitization exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association may set the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure equal to the sum of:

        (A)  The risk-weighted asset amount for a direct exposure to the eligible guarantor (as determined in the wholesale risk weight function described in § 3.131), using the national bank's or Federal savings association's PD for the guarantor, the national bank's or Federal savings association's LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the protection amount of the credit risk mitigant; and

        (B)  () _1_.0 minus the ratio of the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative to the amount of the securitization exposure); multiplied by

        () The risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure without the credit risk mitigant (as determined in §§ 3.14_2_ through 146).

        (4)  The national bank or Federal savings association must make applicable adjustments to the protection amount as required in § 3.134(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure and any more senior securitization exposure that benefits from the hedge. In the context of a synthetic securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all the hedged exposures.

        §§ 3.146-3.150   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 3.146-3.150

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Equity Exposures

        § 3.151   Introduction and exposure measurement.

#### § § 3.151

        (a)  (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 3.152 or, if it qualifies to do so, the Internal Models Approach (IMA) in § 3.153. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the look-through approaches provided in § 3.154 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 3.2), as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 3.154.

        (3)  (i) Stable value protection means a contract where the provider of the contract is obligated to pay:

        (A) The policy owner of a separate account an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and cost basis of the separate account when the policy owner of the separate account surrenders the policy, or

        (B) The beneficiary of the contract an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and book value of a specified portfolio of assets.

        (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases stable value protection on its investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of its investment in the separate account attributable to the stable value protection as an exposure to the provider of the protection and the remaining portion of the carrying value of its separate account as an equity exposure to an investment fund.

        (iii) A national bank or Federal savings association that provides stable value protection must treat the exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carrying value determined as the sum of § 3.151(b)(1) and (2).

        (b)  For purposes of this subpart, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is:

        (1) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure, the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of the exposure;

        (2) For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure, the effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) for a given small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (3) For unfunded equity commitments that are unconditional, the effective notional principal amount is the notional amount of the commitment. For unfunded equity commitments that are conditional, the effective notional principal amount is the national bank's or Federal savings association's best estimate of the amount that would be funded under economic downturn conditions.

        § 3.152   Simple risk weight approach (SRWA).

#### § § 3.152

        (a)  Under the SRWA, a national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined in this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined in § 3.154.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest applicable risk weight in this section.

        (1)  An equity exposure to an entity whose credit exposures are exempt from the 0.03 percent PD floor in § 3.131(d)(2) is assigned a zero percent risk weight.

        (2)  An equity exposure to a Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) is assigned a 20 percent risk weight.

        (3)  The following equity exposures are assigned a 100 percent risk weight:

        (i)  An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.

        (ii)  The effective portion of a hedge pair.

        (iii)  Equity exposures, excluding significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the OCC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.

        (A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a national bank or Federal savings association does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.

        (B) When determining which of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures qualifies for a 100 percent risk weight under this section, a national bank or Federal savings association first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).

        (4)  Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to § 3.22(b)(4) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.

        (5)  A publicly traded equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge pair) is assigned a 300 percent risk weight.

        (6)  An equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) that is not publicly traded is assigned a 400 percent risk weight.

        (7)  An equity exposure to an investment firm that:

        (i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the OCC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2; and

        (ii) Has greater than immaterial leverage is assigned a 600 percent risk weight.

        (c) —(1)  A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.

        (2)  Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the national bank or Federal savings association acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the national bank or Federal savings association will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A national bank or Federal savings association must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E:

        (i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals zero. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.

        (ii) Under the variability-reduction method of measuring effectiveness:

        (iii) Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then the value of E is zero.

        (3) The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

        (4) The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

        § 3.153   Internal models approach (IMA).

#### § § 3.153

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may calculate its risk-weighted asset amount for equity exposures using the IMA by modeling publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) or by modeling only publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).

        (b)  To qualify to use the IMA to calculate risk-weighted assets for equity exposures, a national bank or Federal savings association must receive prior written approval from the OCC. To receive such approval, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the national bank or Federal savings association meets the following criteria:

        (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have one or more models that:

        (i) Assess the potential decline in value of its modeled equity exposures;

        (ii) Are commensurate with the size, complexity, and composition of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures; and

        (iii) Adequately capture both general market risk and idiosyncratic risk.

        (2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's model must produce an estimate of potential losses for its modeled equity exposures that is no less than the estimate of potential losses produced by a VaR methodology employing a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval of the distribution of quarterly returns for a benchmark portfolio of equity exposures comparable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures using a long-term sample period.

        (3) The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the national bank's or Federal savings association's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the national bank's or Federal savings association's estimates.

        (4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the national bank's or Federal savings association's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the national bank's or Federal savings association's model uses a scenario methodology, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the national bank or Federal savings association employs risk factor models, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.

        (5) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures and that the national bank or Federal savings association has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The national bank or Federal savings association must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures.

        (c)  If a national bank or Federal savings association models publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures, the national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:

        (1) The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under § 3.152) and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under § 3.154); and

        (2) The greater of:

        (i) The estimate of potential losses on the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) generated by the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or

        (ii) The sum of:

        (A) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund;

        (B) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs; and

        (C) 300 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures that are not publicly traded, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund.

        (d)  If a national bank or Federal savings association models only publicly traded equity exposures, the national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:

        (1) The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under §§ 3.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under § 3.152), each equity exposure that qualifies for a 400 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(5) or a 600 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(6) (as determined under § 3.152), and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under § 3.154); and

        (2) The greater of:

        (i) The estimate of potential losses on the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) generated by the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or

        (ii) The sum of:

        (A) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under § 3.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund; and

        (B) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs.

        § 3.154   Equity exposures to investment funds.

#### § § 3.154

        (a)  (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.152(b)(3)(i), a national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alternative modified look-through approach in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.152(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.

        (3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the national bank or Federal savings association does not use the full look-through approach, the national bank or Federal savings association may use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 3.152(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.

        (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart E of this part as if the proportional ownership share of each exposure were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association) may either:

        (1) Set the risk-weighted asset amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:

        (i) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association; and

        (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of the fund; or

        (2) Include the national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the fund in the national bank's or Federal savings association's IMA.

        (c)  Under this approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight assigned according to subpart D of this part that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under its prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).

        (d)  Under this approach, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories assigned according to subpart D of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the highest applicable risk weight. A national bank or Federal savings association may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.

        § 3.155   Equity derivative contracts.

#### § § 3.155

        (a) Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an equity derivative contract under this part, a national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk-weighted asset amount for the contract under § 3.132.

        (b) Under the SRWA, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a national bank or Federal savings association using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.

#### § §§ 3.156-3.160

      Risk-Weighted Assets for Operational Risk

        § 3.161   Qualification requirements for incorporation of operational risk mitigants.

#### § § 3.161

        (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may adjust its estimate of operational risk exposure to reflect qualifying operational risk mitigants if:

        (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk quantification system is able to generate an estimate of the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure (which does not incorporate qualifying operational risk mitigants) and an estimate of the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure adjusted to incorporate qualifying operational risk mitigants; and

        (2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's methodology for incorporating the effects of insurance, if the national bank or Federal savings association uses insurance as an operational risk mitigant, captures through appropriate discounts to the amount of risk mitigation:

        (i) The residual term of the policy, where less than one year;

        (ii) The cancellation terms of the policy, where less than one year;

        (iii) The policy's timeliness of payment;

        (iv) The uncertainty of payment by the provider of the policy; and

        (v) Mismatches in coverage between the policy and the hedged operational loss event.

        (b)  Qualifying operational risk mitigants are:

        (1) Insurance that:

        (i) Is provided by an unaffiliated company that the national bank or Federal savings association deems to have strong capacity to meet its claims payment obligations and the obligor rating category to which the national bank or Federal savings association assigns the company is assigned a PD equal to or less than 10 basis points;

        (ii) Has an initial term of at least one year and a residual term of more than 90 days;

        (iii) Has a minimum notice period for cancellation by the provider of 90 days;

        (iv) Has no exclusions or limitations based upon regulatory action or for the receiver or liquidator of a failed depository institution; and

        (v) Is explicitly mapped to a potential operational loss event;

        (2) Operational risk mitigants other than insurance for which the OCC has given prior written approval. In evaluating an operational risk mitigant other than insurance, the OCC will consider whether the operational risk mitigant covers potential operational losses in a manner equivalent to holding total capital.

        § 3.162   Mechanics of risk-weighted asset calculation.

#### § § 3.162

        (a) If a national bank or Federal savings association does not qualify to use or does not have qualifying operational risk mitigants, the national bank's or Federal savings association's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is its operational risk exposure minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any).

        (b) If a national bank or Federal savings association qualifies to use operational risk mitigants and has qualifying operational risk mitigants, the national bank's or Federal savings association's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is the greater of:

        (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure adjusted for qualifying operational risk mitigants minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any); or

        (2) 0.8 multiplied by the difference between:

        (i) The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure; and

        (ii) Eligible operational risk offsets (if any).

        (c) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for operational risk equals the national bank's or Federal savings association's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk determined under sections 162(a) or (b) multiplied by 12.5.

        § 3.172   Disclosure requirements.

#### § § 3.172

        (a) A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to section 121(d) of subpart E of this part must publicly disclose each quarter its total and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and their components as calculated under this subpart (that is, common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, total qualifying capital, and total risk-weighted assets).

        (b) A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to section 121(d) of subpart E of this part must comply with paragraph (c) of this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction.

        (c)(1) A national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 3.173. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes to these are disclosed in the interim. Management may provide all of the disclosures required by this subpart in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.

        (3) If a national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose those specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.

        (d)(1) A national bank or Federal savings association that meets any of the criteria in § 3.100(b)(1) before January 1, 2015, must publicly disclose each quarter its supplementary leverage ratio and the components thereof (that is, tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure) as calculated under subpart B of this part, beginning with the first quarter in 2015. This disclosure requirement applies without regard to whether the national bank or Federal savings association has completed the parallel run process and received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d).

        (2) A national bank or Federal savings association that meets any of the criteria in § 3.100(b)(1) on or after January 1, 2015, or a Category III national bank or Federal savings association must publicly disclose each quarter its supplementary leverage ratio and the components thereof (that is, tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure) as calculated under subpart B of this part beginning with the calendar quarter immediately following the quarter in which the national bank or Federal savings association becomes an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association or a Category III national bank or Federal savings association. This disclosure requirement applies without regard to whether the national bank or Federal savings association has completed the parallel run process and has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d).

        (3) The disclosures described in Tables 1 through 12 to § 3.173 must be made publicly available for twelve consecutive quarters beginning on January 1, 2014, or a shorter period, as applicable, for the quarters after the national bank or Federal savings association has completed the parallel run process and received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d). The disclosures described in Table 13 to § 3.173 must be made publicly available for twelve consecutive quarters beginning on January 1, 2015, or a shorter period, as applicable, for the quarters after the national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to the disclosure of the supplementary leverage ratio pursuant to §§ 3.172(d) and 3.173(a)(2).

        (b)  For each separate risk area described in Tables 5 through 12 to § 3.173, the national bank or Federal savings association must describe its risk management objectives and policies, including:

        (1) Strategies and processes;

        (2) The structure and organization of the relevant risk management function;

        (3) The scope and nature of risk reporting and/or measurement systems; and

        (4) Policies for hedging and/or mitigating risk and strategies and processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants.

        (c) Except as provided in § 3.172(b), a national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.172(d) must make the disclosures described in Table 13 to § 3.173; provided, however, the disclosures required under this paragraph are required without regard to whether the national bank or Federal savings association has completed the parallel run process and has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d). The national bank or Federal savings association must make these disclosures publicly available beginning on January 1, 2015.

      (b)  (1) This subpart applies to a national bank or Federal savings association that:

      (i) Is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as identified pursuant to 12 CFR 217.402;

      (ii) Is a Category II national bank or Federal savings association;

      (iii) Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to this subpart (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or 12 CFR part 324 (FDIC), to calculate its risk-based capital requirements;

      (iv) Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to subpart E of 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; or

      (v) Elects to use this subpart to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.

      (2) A market risk national bank or Federal savings association must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).

      (c)  Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:

      (1) The national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the OCC that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;

      (2) The national bank or Federal savings association appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;

      (3) The national bank or Federal savings association notifies the OCC in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and

      (4) The exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the national bank or Federal savings association.

      means a bond option, bond future, or any other instrument linked to a bond that gives rise to similar counterparty credit risk.

      means the indicators of a national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk profile that reflect a current and forward-looking assessment of the national bank's or Federal savings association's underlying business risk factors and internal control environment.

      (CDS) means a financial contract executed under standard industry documentation that allows one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of one or more exposures (reference exposure(s)) to another party (the protection provider) for a certain period of time.

      (CVA) means the fair value adjustment to reflect counterparty credit risk in valuation of OTC derivative contracts.

      —For the purposes of calculating capital requirements under this subpart:

      (1)  (i) A retail exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association is in default if:

      (A) The exposure is 180 days past due, in the case of a residential mortgage exposure or revolving exposure;

      (B) The exposure is 120 days past due, in the case of retail exposures that are not residential mortgage exposures or revolving exposures; or

      (C) The national bank or Federal savings association has taken a full or partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or material negative fair value adjustment of principal on the exposure for credit-related reasons.

      (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(i) of this definition, for a retail exposure held by a non-U.S. subsidiary of the national bank or Federal savings association that is subject to an internal ratings-based approach to capital adequacy consistent with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework” in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the national bank or Federal savings association may elect to use the definition of default that is used in that jurisdiction, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association has obtained prior approval from the OCC to use the definition of default in that jurisdiction.

      (iii) A retail exposure in default remains in default until the national bank or Federal savings association has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on the exposure.

      (2)  (i) A national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale obligor is in default if:

      (A) The national bank or Federal savings association determines that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the national bank or Federal savings association in full, without recourse by the national bank or Federal savings association to actions such as realizing collateral (if held); or

      (B) The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation(s) to the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (ii) An obligor in default remains in default until the national bank or Federal savings association has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on all exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association to the obligor (other than exposures that have been fully written-down or charged-off).

      means a measure of the association among operational losses across and within units of measure.

      means, with respect to an exposure held by the national bank or Federal savings association, those conditions in which the aggregate default rates for that exposure's wholesale or retail exposure subcategory (or subdivision of such subcategory selected by the national bank or Federal savings association) in the exposure's national jurisdiction (or subdivision of such jurisdiction selected by the national bank or Federal savings association) are significantly higher than average.

      of a wholesale exposure means:

      (1) For wholesale exposures other than repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts described in paragraph (2) or (3) of this definition:

      (i) The weighted-average remaining maturity (measured in years, whole or fractional) of the expected contractual cash flows from the exposure, using the undiscounted amounts of the cash flows as weights; or

      (ii) The nominal remaining maturity (measured in years, whole or fractional) of the exposure.

      (2) For repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement for which the national bank or Federal savings association does not apply the internal models approach in section 132(d), the weighted-average remaining maturity (measured in years, whole or fractional) of the individual transactions subject to the qualifying master netting agreement, with the weight of each individual transaction set equal to the notional amount of the transaction.

      (3) For repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts for which the national bank or Federal savings association applies the internal models approach in § 3.132(d), the value determined in § 3.132(d)(4).

      with respect to a guarantee or credit derivative obtained by a national bank or Federal savings association, means:

      (1)  A depository institution, a bank holding company, a savings and loan holding company, or a securities broker or dealer registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act, if at the time the guarantee is issued or anytime thereafter, has issued and outstanding an unsecured debt security without credit enhancement that is investment grade.

      (2)  A foreign bank, or a non-U.S.-based securities firm if the national bank or Federal savings association demonstrates that the guarantor is subject to consolidated supervision and regulation comparable to that imposed on U.S. depository institutions, or securities broker-dealers) if at the time the guarantee is issued or anytime thereafter, has issued and outstanding an unsecured debt security without credit enhancement that is investment grade.

      means amounts, not to exceed expected operational loss, that:

      (1) Are generated by internal business practices to absorb highly predictable and reasonably stable operational losses, including reserves calculated consistent with GAAP; and

      (2) Are available to cover expected operational losses with a high degree of certainty over a one-year horizon.

      means a purchased wholesale exposure that:

      (1) The national bank or Federal savings association or securitization SPE purchased from an unaffiliated seller and did not directly or indirectly originate;

      (2) Was generated on an arm's-length basis between the seller and the obligor (intercompany accounts receivable and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other do not satisfy this criterion);

      (3) Provides the national bank or Federal savings association or securitization SPE with a claim on all proceeds from the exposure or a pro rata interest in the proceeds from the exposure;

      (4) Has an M of less than one year; and

      (5) When consolidated by obligor, does not represent a concentrated exposure relative to the portfolio of purchased wholesale exposures.

      means the expected value of the probability distribution of non-negative credit risk exposures to a counterparty at any specified future date before the maturity date of the longest term transaction in the netting set. Any negative fair values in the probability distribution of fair values to a counterparty at a specified future date are set to zero to convert the probability distribution of fair values to the probability distribution of credit risk exposures.

      means the expected value of the distribution of potential aggregate operational losses, as generated by the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk quantification system using a one-year horizon.

      means the weighted average over time of expected (non-negative) exposures to a counterparty where the weights are the proportion of the time interval that an individual expected exposure represents. When calculating risk-based capital requirements, the average is taken over a one-year horizon.

      means:

      (1) For the on-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, a cleared transaction, or default fund contribution), EAD means the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees) for the exposure or segment less any allocated transfer risk reserve for the exposure or segment.

      (2) For the off-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, cleared transaction, or default fund contribution) in the form of a loan commitment, line of credit, trade-related letter of credit, or transaction-related contingency, EAD means the national bank's or Federal savings association's best estimate of net additions to the outstanding amount owed the national bank or Federal savings association, including estimated future additional draws of principal and accrued but unpaid interest and fees, that are likely to occur over a one-year horizon assuming the wholesale exposure or the retail exposures in the segment were to go into default. This estimate of net additions must reflect what would be expected during economic downturn conditions. For the purposes of this definition:

      (i) Trade-related letters of credit are short-term, self-liquidating instruments that are used to finance the movement of goods and are collateralized by the underlying goods.

      (ii) Transaction-related contingencies relate to a particular transaction and include, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based letters of credit.

      (3) For the off-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction, or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, cleared transaction, or default fund contribution) in the form of anything other than a loan commitment, line of credit, trade-related letter of credit, or transaction-related contingency, EAD means the notional amount of the exposure or segment.

      (4) EAD for OTC derivative contracts is calculated as described in § 3.132. A national bank or Federal savings association also may determine EAD for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans as described in § 3.132.

      means any of the wholesale, retail, securitization, or equity exposure categories.

      means, with respect to a national bank or Federal savings association, gross operational loss amounts, dates, recoveries, and relevant causal information for operational loss events occurring at organizations other than the national bank or Federal savings association.

      means a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or OTC derivative for which a national bank or Federal savings association calculates its EAD using the internal models methodology of § 3.132(d).

      means, with respect to a national bank or Federal savings association, gross operational loss amounts, dates, recoveries, and relevant causal information for operational loss events occurring at the national bank or Federal savings association.

      means:

      (1) For a wholesale exposure, the greatest of:

      (i) Zero;

      (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run default-weighted average economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the national bank or Federal savings association to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon over a mix of economic conditions, including economic downturn conditions; or

      (iii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the national bank or Federal savings association to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon during economic downturn conditions.

      (2) For a segment of retail exposures, the greatest of:

      (i) Zero;

      (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run default-weighted average economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the exposures in the segment were to default within a one-year horizon over a mix of economic conditions, including economic downturn conditions; or

      (iii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the exposures in the segment were to default within a one-year horizon during economic downturn conditions.

      (3) The economic loss on an exposure in the event of default is all material credit-related losses on the exposure (including accrued but unpaid interest or fees, losses on the sale of collateral, direct workout costs, and an appropriate allocation of indirect workout costs). Where positive or negative cash flows on a wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor or a defaulted retail exposure (including proceeds from the sale of collateral, workout costs, additional extensions of credit to facilitate repayment of the exposure, and draw-downs of unused credit lines) occur after the date of default, the economic loss must reflect the net present value of cash flows as of the default date using a discount rate appropriate to the risk of the defaulted exposure.

      means the legal entity or natural person contractually obligated on a wholesale exposure, except that a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the following exposures as having separate obligors:

      (1) Exposures to the same legal entity or natural person denominated in different currencies;

      (2)(i) An income-producing real estate exposure for which all or substantially all of the repayment of the exposure is reliant on the cash flows of the real estate serving as collateral for the exposure; the national bank or Federal savings association, in economic substance, does not have recourse to the borrower beyond the real estate collateral; and no cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place other than clauses obtained solely out of an abundance of caution; and

      (ii) Other credit exposures to the same legal entity or natural person; and

      (ii) Other credit exposures to the same legal entity or natural person.

      means a loss (excluding insurance or tax effects) resulting from an operational loss event. _Operational loss_ includes all expenses associated with an operational loss event except for opportunity costs, forgone revenue, and costs related to risk management and control enhancements implemented to prevent future operational losses.

      means an event that results in loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event type categories:

      (1) Internal fraud, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from an act involving at least one internal party of a type intended to defraud, misappropriate property, or circumvent regulations, the law, or company policy excluding diversity- and discrimination-type events.

      (2) External fraud, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from an act by a third party of a type intended to defraud, misappropriate property, or circumvent the law. Retail credit card losses arising from non-contractual, third-party-initiated fraud (for example, identity theft) are external fraud operational losses. All other third-party-initiated credit losses are to be treated as credit risk losses.

      (3) Employment practices and workplace safety, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from an act inconsistent with employment, health, or safety laws or agreements, payment of personal injury claims, or payment arising from diversity- and discrimination-type events.

      (5) Damage to physical assets, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from the loss of or damage to physical assets from natural disaster or other events.

      (6) Business disruption and system failures, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from disruption of business or system failures.

      (7) Execution, delivery, and process management, which means the operational loss event type category that comprises operational losses resulting from failed transaction processing or process management or losses arising from relations with trade counterparties and vendors.

      means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events (including legal risk but excluding strategic and reputational risk).

      means the 99.9th percentile of the distribution of potential aggregate operational losses, as generated by the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk quantification system over a one-year horizon (and not incorporating eligible operational risk offsets or qualifying operational risk mitigants).

      means an exposure (other than a securitization exposure, an equity exposure, a residential mortgage exposure, a pre-sold construction loan, a qualifying revolving exposure, or the residual value portion of a lease exposure) that is managed as part of a segment of exposures with homogeneous risk characteristics, not on an individual-exposure basis, and is either:

      (1) An exposure to an individual for non-business purposes; or

      (2) An exposure to an individual or company for business purposes if the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated business credit exposure to the individual or company is $1 million or less.

      means:

      (1) For a wholesale exposure to a non-defaulted obligor, the national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run average one-year default rate for the rating grade assigned by the national bank or Federal savings association to the obligor, capturing the average default experience for obligors in the rating grade over a mix of economic conditions (including economic downturn conditions) sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of the average one-year default rate over the economic cycle for the rating grade.

      (2) For a segment of non-defaulted retail exposures, the national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run average one-year default rate for the exposures in the segment, capturing the average default experience for exposures in the segment over a mix of economic conditions (including economic downturn conditions) sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of the average one-year default rate over the economic cycle for the segment.

      (3) For a wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor or segment of defaulted retail exposures, 100 percent.

      means a qualifying master netting agreement that provides for termination and close-out netting across multiple types of financial transactions or qualifying master netting agreements in the event of a counterparty's default, provided that the underlying financial transactions are OTC derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions. In order to treat an agreement as a qualifying cross-product master netting agreement for purposes of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association must comply with the requirements of § 3.3(c) of this part with respect to that agreement.

      means an exposure (other than a securitization exposure or equity exposure) to an individual that is managed as part of a segment of exposures with homogeneous risk characteristics, not on an individual-exposure basis, and:

      (1) Is revolving (that is, the amount outstanding fluctuates, determined largely by a borrower's decision to borrow and repay up to a pre-established maximum amount, except for an outstanding amount that the borrower is required to pay in full every month);

      (4) A segment of exposures that contains one or more exposures that fails to meet paragraph (3)(ii) of this definition must be treated as a segment of other retail exposures for the 24 month period following the month in which the total outstanding amount of one or more exposures individually exceeds $100,000.

      means a residential mortgage exposure, a qualifying revolving exposure, or an other retail exposure.

      means the residential mortgage exposure, qualifying revolving exposure, or other retail exposure subcategory.

      means a variable used in determining risk-based capital requirements for wholesale and retail exposures, specifically probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), or effective maturity (M).

      means a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood and loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses. _Scenario analysis_ may include the well-reasoned evaluation and use of external operational loss event data, adjusted as appropriate to ensure relevance to a national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk profile and control structure.

      means the sum of:

      (1) Risk-weighted assets for wholesale exposures that are not IMM exposures, cleared transactions, or default fund contributions to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures;

      (3) Risk-weighted assets for assets not defined by an exposure category;

      (4) Risk-weighted assets for non-material portfolios of exposures;

      (5) Risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures (as determined in § 3.132(d));

      means the difference between the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk exposure and the national bank's or Federal savings association's expected operational loss.

      means the level (for example, organizational unit or operational loss event type) at which the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk quantification system generates a separate distribution of potential operational losses.

      means a credit exposure to a company, natural person, sovereign, or governmental entity (other than a securitization exposure, retail exposure, pre-sold construction loan, or equity exposure).

      means the HVCRE or non-HVCRE wholesale exposure subcategory.

    Subpart F—Risk-Weighted Assets—Market Risk

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 62157, 62273, Oct. 11, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 3.201   Purpose, applicability, and reservation of authority.

#### § § 3.201

      (a)  This subpart F establishes risk-based capital requirements for national banks or Federal savings associations with significant exposure to market risk, provides methods for these national banks or Federal savings associations to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public disclosure requirements.

      (b)  (1) This subpart F applies to any national bank or Federal savings association with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent quarterly [regulatory report]), equal to:

      (i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly [Call Report or FR Y-9C]; or

      (ii) $1 billion or more.

      (2) The OCC may apply this subpart to any national bank or Federal savings association if the OCC deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the national bank or Federal savings association or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.

      (3) The OCC may exclude a national bank or Federal savings association that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this subpart if the OCC determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the national bank or Federal savings association and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

      (c)  (1) The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this subpart if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this subpart is not commensurate with the market risk of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in 12 CFR 3.404.

      (2) If the OCC determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this subpart by the national bank or Federal savings association for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.

      (3) The OCC may also require a national bank or Federal savings association to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.

      (4) Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.

      § 3.202   Definitions.

#### § § 3.202

      means:

      (1) A securitization position for which all or substantially all of the value of the underlying exposures is based on the credit quality of a single company for which a two-way market exists, or on commonly traded indices based on such exposures for which a two-way market exists on the indices; or

      (2) A position that is not a securitization position and that hedges a position described in paragraph (1) of this definition; and

      § 3.203   Requirements for application of this subpart F.

#### § § 3.203

      (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which of its trading assets and trading liabilities are trading positions and which of its trading positions are correlation trading positions. These policies and procedures must take into account:

      (i) The extent to which a position, or a hedge of its material risks, can be marked-to-market daily by reference to a two-way market; and

      (ii) Possible impairments to the liquidity of a position or its hedge.

      (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for its trading positions that are approved by senior management of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (i) The trading strategy must articulate the expected holding period of, and the market risk associated with, each portfolio of trading positions.

      (ii) The hedging strategy must articulate for each portfolio of trading positions the level of market risk the national bank or Federal savings association is willing to accept and must detail the instruments, techniques, and strategies the national bank or Federal savings association will use to hedge the risk of the portfolio.

      (b) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined policies and procedures for actively managing all covered positions. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must require:

      (i) Marking positions to market or to model on a daily basis;

      (ii) Daily assessment of the national bank's or Federal savings association's ability to hedge position and portfolio risks, and of the extent of market liquidity;

      (iii) Establishment and daily monitoring of limits on positions by a risk control unit independent of the trading business unit;

      (iv) Daily monitoring by senior management of information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section;

      (v) At least annual reassessment of established limits on positions by senior management; and

      (vi) At least annual assessments by qualified personnel of the quality of market inputs to the valuation process, the soundness of key assumptions, the reliability of parameter estimation in pricing models, and the stability and accuracy of model calibration under alternative market scenarios.

      (2)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a process for prudent valuation of its covered positions that includes policies and procedures on the valuation of positions, marking positions to market or to model, independent price verification, and valuation adjustments or reserves. The valuation process must consider, as appropriate, unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, early termination costs, investing and funding costs, liquidity, and model risk.

      (c)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before using any internal model to calculate its risk-based capital requirement under this subpart.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must meet all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis. The national bank or Federal savings association must promptly notify the OCC when:

      (i) The national bank or Federal savings association plans to extend the use of a model that the OCC has approved under this subpart to an additional business line or product type;

      (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association makes any change to an internal model approved by the OCC under this subpart that would result in a material change in the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a portfolio of covered positions; or

      (iii) The national bank or Federal savings association makes any material change to its modeling assumptions.

      (3) The OCC may rescind its approval of the use of any internal model (in whole or in part) or of the determination of the approach under § 3.209(a)(2)(ii) for a national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled correlation trading positions and determine an appropriate capital requirement for the covered positions to which the model would apply, if the OCC determines that the model no longer complies with this subpart or fails to reflect accurately the risks of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions.

      (4) The national bank or Federal savings association must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its internal models in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance those models as appropriate to ensure that they continue to meet the OCC's standards for model approval and employ risk measurement methodologies that are most appropriate for the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions.

      (5) The national bank or Federal savings association must incorporate its internal models into its risk management process and integrate the internal models used for calculating its VaR-based measure into its daily risk management process.

      (6) The level of sophistication of a national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must be commensurate with the complexity and amount of its covered positions. A national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models may use any of the generally accepted approaches, including but not limited to variance-covariance models, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations, to measure market risk.

      (7) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must properly measure all the material risks in the covered positions to which they are applied.

      (8) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must conservatively assess the risks arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios.

      (9) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal models to ensure continued applicability and relevance.

      (10) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal models to measure specific risk, the internal models must also satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of § 3.207.

      (d)  (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.

      (2) The national bank or Federal savings association must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The national bank's or Federal savings association's validation process must be independent of the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:

      (i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the internal models;

      (ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and the comparison of the national bank's or Federal savings association's model outputs with relevant internal and external data sources or estimation techniques; and

      (iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting. For internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this process must include a comparison of the changes in the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio value that would have occurred were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with VaR-based measures during a sample period not used in model development.

      (3) The national bank or Federal savings association must stress test the market risk of its covered positions at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, and in no case less frequently than quarterly. The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the national bank's or Federal savings association's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.

      (4) The national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the national bank's or Federal savings association's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the national bank's or Federal savings association's measures for market risk under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the national bank's or Federal savings association's board of directors (or a committee thereof).

      (e)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its market risk. The assessment must take into account risks that may not be captured fully in the VaR-based measure, including concentration and liquidity risk under stressed market conditions.

      (f)  The national bank or Federal savings association must adequately document all material aspects of its internal models, management and valuation of covered positions, control, oversight, validation and review processes and results, and internal assessment of capital adequacy.

      § 3.204   Measure for market risk.

#### § § 3.204

      (a)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its standardized measure for market risk by following the steps described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association also must calculate an advanced measure for market risk by following the steps in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the standardized measure for market risk, which equals the sum of the VaR-based capital requirement, stressed VaR-based capital requirement, specific risk add-ons, incremental risk capital requirement, comprehensive risk capital requirement, and capital requirement for  exposures all as defined under this paragraph (a)(2), (except, that the national bank or Federal savings association may not use the SFA in section 210(b)(2)(vii)(B) of this subpart for purposes of this calculation)[, plus any additional capital requirement established by the OCC]. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notifications from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d) also must calculate the advanced measure for market risk, which equals the sum of the VaR-based capital requirement, stressed VaR-based capital requirement, specific risk add-ons, incremental risk capital requirement, comprehensive risk capital requirement, and capital requirement for  exposures as defined under this paragraph (a)(2) [, plus any additional capital requirement established by the OCC].

      (i)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based capital requirement equals the greater of:

      (A) The previous day's VaR-based measure as calculated under § 3.205; or

      (B) The average of the daily VaR-based measures as calculated under § 3.205 for each of the preceding 60 business days multiplied by three, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (ii)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's stressed VaR-based capital requirement equals the greater of:

      (A) The most recent stressed VaR-based measure as calculated under § 3.206; or

      (B) The average of the stressed VaR-based measures as calculated under § 3.206 for each of the preceding 12 weeks multiplied by three, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (iii)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk add-ons equal any specific risk add-ons that are required under § 3.207 and are calculated in accordance with § 3.210.

      (iv)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's incremental risk capital requirement equals any incremental risk capital requirement as calculated under section 208 of this subpart.

      (v)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's comprehensive risk capital requirement equals any comprehensive risk capital requirement as calculated under section 209 of this subpart.

      (vi)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirement for  exposures equals:

      (A) The absolute value of the fair value of those  exposures that are not captured in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure or under paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this section; and

      (B) With the prior written approval of the OCC, the capital requirement for any  exposures using alternative techniques that appropriately measure the market risk associated with those exposures.

      (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must compare each of its most recent 250 business days' trading losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures calibrated to a one-day holding period and at a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level. A national bank or Federal savings association must begin backtesting as required by this paragraph (b) no later than one year after the later of January 1, 2014 and the date on which the national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to this subpart. In the interim, consistent with safety and soundness principles, a national bank or Federal savings association subject to this subpart as of January 1, 2014 should continue to follow backtesting procedures in accordance with the OCC's supervisory expectations.

      (1) Once each quarter, the national bank or Federal savings association must identify the number of exceptions (that is, the number of business days for which the actual daily net trading loss, if any, exceeds the corresponding daily VaR-based measure) that have occurred over the preceding 250 business days.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the multiplication factor in Table 1 to § 3.204 that corresponds to the number of exceptions identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine its VaR-based capital requirement for market risk under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and to determine its stressed VaR-based capital requirement for market risk under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section until it obtains the next quarter's backtesting results, unless the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that a different adjustment or other action is appropriate.

      § 3.205   VaR-based measure.

#### § § 3.205

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of § 3.207. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under § 3.209. A national bank or Federal savings association may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.

      (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve—in no case less than six—to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.

      (2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the national bank or Federal savings association validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.

      (3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the fair value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. A national bank or Federal savings association with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.

      (4) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the OCC the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its VaR-based measure that the national bank or Federal savings association uses in its pricing models.

      (5) The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual positions for which such proxies are used.

      (b)  (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. A national bank or Federal savings association that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the OCC.

      (2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The national bank or Federal savings association must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the national bank or Federal savings association must either:

      (i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or

      (ii) Demonstrate to the OCC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the national bank's or Federal savings association's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A national bank or Federal savings association using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.

      (c) A national bank or Federal savings association must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the OCC for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the national bank or Federal savings association and the OCC to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the OCC will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions. The national bank or Federal savings association must retain and make available to the OCC the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:

      (1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;

      (2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and

      (3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).

      § 3.206   Stressed VaR-based measure.

#### § § 3.206

      (a)  At least weekly, a national bank or Federal savings association must use the same internal model(s) used to calculate its VaR-based measure to calculate a stressed VaR-based measure.

      (b)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a stressed VaR-based measure for its covered positions using the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR-based measure, subject to the same confidence level and holding period applicable to the VaR-based measure under § 3.205, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the national bank's or Federal savings association's current portfolio.

      (2) The stressed VaR-based measure must be calculated at least weekly and be no less than the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure.

      (3) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the national bank's or Federal savings association's stressed VaR-based measure under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:

      (i) How the national bank or Federal savings association links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and

      (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's process for selecting, reviewing, and updating the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and for monitoring the appropriateness of the period to the national bank's or Federal savings association's current portfolio.

      (4) Nothing in this section prevents the OCC from requiring a national bank or Federal savings association to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the stressed VaR-based measure.

      § 3.207   Specific risk.

#### § § 3.207

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must use one of the methods in this section to measure the specific risk for each of its debt, equity, and securitization positions with specific risk.

      (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association may use models to measure the specific risk of covered positions as provided in paragraph (a) of section 205 of this subpart (therefore, excluding securitization positions that are not modeled under section 209 of this subpart). A national bank or Federal savings association must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under § 3.209.

      (1)  (i) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal models to measure the specific risk of a portfolio, the internal models must:

      (A) Explain the historical price variation in the portfolio;

      (B) Be responsive to changes in market conditions;

      (C) Be robust to an adverse environment, including signaling rising risk in an adverse environment; and

      (D) Capture all material components of specific risk for the debt and equity positions in the portfolio. Specifically, the internal models must:

      () Capture event risk and idiosyncratic risk; and

      () Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to material differences between positions that are similar but not identical and to changes in portfolio composition and concentrations.

      (ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association calculates an incremental risk measure for a portfolio of debt or equity positions under section 208 of this subpart, the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to capture default and credit migration risks in its internal models used to measure the specific risk of those portfolios.

      (2)  If the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure captures all material aspects of specific risk for one or more of its portfolios of debt, equity, or correlation trading positions, the national bank or Federal savings association has no specific risk add-on for those portfolios for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of § 3.204.

      (c)  (1) If the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk for a portfolio of debt, equity, or correlation trading positions, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a specific-risk add-on for the portfolio under the standardized measurement method as described in § 3.210.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a specific risk add-on under the standardized measurement method as described in § 3.210 for all of its securitization positions that are not modeled under § 3.209.

      § 3.208   Incremental risk.

#### § § 3.208

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under § 3.207(b) using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the national bank's or Federal savings association's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the national bank or Federal savings association internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. A national bank or Federal savings association may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.

      (b)  For purposes of calculating the incremental risk measure, the incremental risk model must:

      (1) Measure incremental risk over a one-year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.

      (i) A constant level of risk assumption means that the national bank or Federal savings association rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions at the beginning of each liquidity horizon over the one-year horizon in a manner that maintains the national bank's or Federal savings association's initial risk level. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine the frequency of rebalancing in a manner consistent with the liquidity horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a national bank or Federal savings association to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.

      (ii) A constant position assumption means that the national bank or Federal savings association maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon. If a national bank or Federal savings association uses this assumption, it must do so consistently across all portfolios.

      (iii) A national bank's or Federal savings association's selection of a constant position or a constant risk assumption must be consistent between the national bank's or Federal savings association's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209 of this subpart, if applicable.

      (iv) A national bank's or Federal savings association's treatment of liquidity horizons must be consistent between the national bank's or Federal savings association's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209, if applicable.

      (2) Recognize the impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors.

      (3) Reflect the effect of issuer and market concentrations, as well as concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed conditions.

      (4) Reflect netting only of long and short positions that reference the same financial instrument.

      (5) Reflect any material mismatch between a position and its hedge.

      (6) Recognize the effect that liquidity horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. In such cases, a national bank or Federal savings association must:

      (i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;

      (ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;

      (iii) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and

      (iv) Capture in the incremental risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies.

      (7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behavior with respect to default and migration changes.

      (8) Maintain consistency with the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing risk.

      (c)  The incremental risk capital requirement is the greater of:

      (1) The average of the incremental risk measures over the previous 12 weeks; or

      (2) The most recent incremental risk measure.

      § 3.209   Comprehensive risk.

#### § § 3.209

      (a)  (1) Subject to the prior approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may use the method in this section to measure comprehensive risk, that is, all price risk, for one or more portfolios of correlation trading positions.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association that measures the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions using internal models must calculate at least weekly a comprehensive risk measure that captures all price risk according to the requirements of this section. The comprehensive risk measure is either:

      (i) The sum of:

      (A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; and

      (B) A surcharge for the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled correlation trading positions equal to the total specific risk add-on for such positions as calculated under section 210 of this subpart multiplied by 8.0 percent; or

      (ii) With approval of the OCC and provided the national bank or Federal savings association has met the requirements of this section for a period of at least one year and can demonstrate the effectiveness of the model through the results of ongoing model validation efforts including robust benchmarking, the greater of:

      (A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; or

      (B) The total specific risk add-on that would apply to the bank's modeled correlation trading positions as calculated under section 210 of this subpart multiplied by 8.0 percent.

      (b)  If a national bank or Federal savings association uses an internal model to measure the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions:

      (1) The internal model must measure comprehensive risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.

      (2) The model must capture all material price risk, including but not limited to the following:

      (i) The risks associated with the contractual structure of cash flows of the position, its issuer, and its underlying exposures;

      (ii) Credit spread risk, including nonlinear price risks;

      (iii) The volatility of implied correlations, including nonlinear price risks such as the cross-effect between spreads and correlations;

      (iv) Basis risk;

      (v) Recovery rate volatility as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; and

      (vi) To the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates the benefits of dynamic hedging, the static nature of the hedge over the liquidity horizon must be recognized. In such cases, a national bank or Federal savings association must:

      (A) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;

      (B) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;

      (C) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and

      (D) Capture in the comprehensive risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies;

      (3) The national bank or Federal savings association must use market data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the national bank's or Federal savings association's correlation trading positions in order to ensure that the national bank or Federal savings association fully captures the material risks of the correlation trading positions in its comprehensive risk measure in accordance with this section; and

      (4) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to demonstrate that its model is an appropriate representation of comprehensive risk in light of the historical price variation of its correlation trading positions.

      (c)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must at least weekly apply specific, supervisory stress scenarios to its portfolio of correlation trading positions that capture changes in:

      (i) Default rates;

      (ii) Recovery rates;

      (iii) Credit spreads;

      (iv) Correlations of underlying exposures; and

      (v) Correlations of a correlation trading position and its hedge.

      (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must retain and make available to the OCC the results of the supervisory stress testing, including comparisons with the capital requirements generated by the national bank's or Federal savings association's comprehensive risk model.

      (ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must report to the OCC promptly any instances where the stress tests indicate any material deficiencies in the comprehensive risk model.

      (d)  The comprehensive risk capital requirement is the greater of:

      (1) The average of the comprehensive risk measures over the previous 12 weeks; or

      (2) The most recent comprehensive risk measure.

      § 3.210   Standardized measurement method for specific risk.

#### § § 3.210

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under § 3.209. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in this subpart, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position in § 3.202, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this section 210 of this subpart.

      (1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current fair value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.

      (2) For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the national bank or Federal savings association directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, a national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.

      (3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, a national bank or Federal savings association may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. A national bank or Federal savings association may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association includes the costs of conversion.

      (4) A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:

      (i) The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in fair value of the debt or securitization position);

      (ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;

      (iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and

      (iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.

      (5) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:

      (i) The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;

      (ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;

      (iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position; and

      (iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in the case where the credit derivative hedge has a standard maturity date:

      (A) The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or

      (B) For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.

      (6) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.

      (b)  (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, a national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.

      (2) For the purpose of this section, the appropriate specific risk-weighting factors include:

      (i)  (A) In accordance with Table 1 to § 3.210, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position based on the CRC applicable to the sovereign, and, as applicable, the remaining contractual maturity of the position, or if there is no CRC applicable to the sovereign, based on whether the sovereign entity is a member of the OECD. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, sovereign debt positions that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States are treated as having a CRC of 0.

      (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign to a sovereign debt position a specific risk-weighting factor that is lower than the applicable specific risk-weighting factor in Table 1 to § 3.210 if:

      () The position is denominated in the sovereign entity's currency;

      () The national bank or Federal savings association has at least an equivalent amount of liabilities in that currency; and

      () The sovereign entity allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign the lower specific risk-weighting factor to the same exposures to the sovereign entity.

      (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 12.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position immediately upon determination a default has occurred; or if a default has occurred within the previous five years.

      (D) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 0.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position if the sovereign entity is a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC assigned to it, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

      (E) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position if the sovereign is not a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC assigned to it, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

      (ii)  A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a 0.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a debt position that is an exposure to the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, or an MDB.

      (iii)  A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 1.6 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a debt position that is an exposure to a GSE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to preferred stock issued by a GSE.

      (iv)  (A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a debt position that is an exposure to a depository institution, a foreign bank, or a credit union, in accordance with Table 2 to § 3.210, based on the CRC that corresponds to that entity's home country or the OECD membership status of that entity's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the entity's home country, and, as applicable, the remaining contractual maturity of the position.

      (B) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent to a debt position that is an exposure to a depository institution or a foreign bank that is includable in the depository institution's or foreign bank's regulatory capital and that is not subject to deduction as a reciprocal holding under § 3.22.

      (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 12.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a debt position that is an exposure to a foreign bank immediately upon determination that a default by the foreign bank's home country has occurred or if a default by the foreign bank's home country has occurred within the previous five years.

      (v)  (A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(B) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a debt position that is an exposure to a PSE in accordance with Tables 3 and 4 to § 3.210 depending on the position's categorization as a general obligation or revenue obligation based on the CRC that corresponds to the PSE's home country or the OECD membership status of the PSE's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the PSE's home country, and, as applicable, the remaining contractual maturity of the position, as set forth in Tables 3 and 4 of this section.

      (B) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a lower specific risk-weighting factor than would otherwise apply under Tables 3 and 4 of this section to a debt position that is an exposure to a foreign PSE if:

      () The PSE's home country allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign a lower specific risk-weighting factor to such position; and

      () The specific risk-weighting factor is not lower than the risk weight that corresponds to the PSE's home country in accordance with Tables 3 and 4 of this section.

      (C) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a 12.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to a PSE debt position immediately upon determination that a default by the PSE's home country has occurred or if a default by the PSE's home country has occurred within the previous five years.

      (vi)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a corporate debt position in accordance with the investment grade methodology in paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(A) of this section.

      (A)  () For corporate debt positions that are exposures to entities that have issued and outstanding publicly traded instruments, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor based on the category and remaining contractual maturity of the position, in accordance with Table 5 to § 3.2__1__0. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(A)(), the national bank or Federal savings association must determine whether the position is in the investment grade or not investment grade category.

      () A national bank or Federal savings association must assign an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor for corporate debt positions that are exposures to entities that do not have publicly traded instruments outstanding.

      (B)  () A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of at least 8.0 percent to an interest-only mortgage-backed security that is not a securitization position.

      () A national bank or Federal savings association shall not assign a corporate debt position a specific risk-weighting factor that is lower than the specific risk-weighting factor that corresponds to the CRC of the issuer's home country, if applicable, in table 1 of this section.

      (vii)  (A) General requirements. () A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a securitization position using either the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section (and § 3.2_1_1) or assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.

      () A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a specific risk add-on for a securitization position in accordance with paragraph (b)(_2_)(vii)(B) of this section if the national bank or Federal savings association and the securitization position each qualifies to use the SFA in § 3.143. A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association with a securitization position that does not qualify for the SFA under paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section may assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the securitization position using the SSFA in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section or assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.

      () A national bank or Federal savings association must treat a short securitization position as if it is a long securitization position solely for calculation purposes when using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section or the SSFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section.

      (B)  To calculate the specific risk add-on for a securitization position using the SFA, a national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must set the specific risk add-on for the position equal to the risk-based capital requirement as calculated under § 3.143.

      (C)  To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with § 3.211.

      (D)  A national bank or Federal savings association must determine a specific risk add-on using ***th***e SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section, or assign a specific risk-weighting factor using the SSFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section to an n-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(D), regardless of whether the national bank or Federal savings association is a net protection buyer or net protection seller. A national bank or Federal savings association must determine its position in the n-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.

      () For purposes of determining *th*e specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section or the specific risk-weighting factor for an n-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its position as follows:

      () The attachment po_i_nt (parameter A) is *th*e ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's position to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section to calculate the specific add-on for its position in an n-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to the credit enhancement level (L) input to the SFA formula in section 143 of this subpart. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's position. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's position.

      () The detachment point (parameter D) equals **th**e sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's position in the n-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(v_ii_)(B) of this section to calculate the specific risk add-on for its position in an n-to-default credit derivative, parameter D must be set to equal the L input plus the thickness of tranche T input to the SFA formula in § 3.143 of this subpart.

      () A national bank or Federal savings association *th*at does not use the SFA in paragraph (b)(_2_)(vii)(B) of this section to determine a specific risk-add on, or the SSFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) of this section to determine a specific risk-weighting factor for its position in an n-to-default credit derivative must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.

      (c)  For purposes of calculating the comprehensive risk measure for modeled correlation trading positions under either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of § 3.209, the total specific risk add-on is the greater of:

      (1) The sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk add-ons for each net long correlation trading position calculated under this section; or

      (2) The sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk add-ons for each net short correlation trading position calculated under this section.

      (d)  For securitization positions that are not correlation trading positions and for securitizations that are correlation trading positions not modeled under § 3.209, the total specific risk add-on is the greater of:

      (1) The sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk add-ons for each net long securitization position calculated under this section; or

      (2) The sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk add-ons for each net short securitization position calculated under this section.

      (e)  The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of equity positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons of the individual equity positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on of individual equity positions, a national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short equity position by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as determined under this paragraph (e):

      (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short equity position by a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent. For equity positions that are index contracts comprising a well-diversified portfolio of equity instruments, the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short position is multiplied by a specific risk-weighting factor of 2.0 percent.

      (2) For equity positions arising from the following futures-related arbitrage strategies, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to one side (long or short) of each position with the opposite side exempt from an additional capital requirement:

      (i) Long and short positions in exactly the same index at different dates or in different market centers; or

      (ii) Long and short positions in index contracts at the same date in different, but similar indices.

      (3) For futures contracts on main indices that are matched by offsetting positions in a basket of stocks comprising the index, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to the futures and stock basket positions (long and short), provided that such trades are deliberately entered into and separately controlled, and that the basket of stocks is comprised of stocks representing at least 90.0 percent of the capitalization of the index. A main index refers to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the FTSE All-World Index, and any other index for which the national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that the equities represented in the index have liquidity, depth of market, and size of bid-ask spreads comparable to equities in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and FTSE All-World Index.

      (f)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization position that would materially affect the performance of the position by conducting and documenting the analysis set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization position and the materiality of the position in relation to capital.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding for each securitization position by:

      (i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization position prior to acquiring the position and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring position, considering:

      (A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the position, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the position, and deal-specific definitions of default;

      (B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);

      (C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and

      (D) For resecuritization positions, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures.

      § 3.211   Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA).

#### § § 3.211

      (a)  To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.

      (b)  To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.

      (1) K is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D. K is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K equal to 0.08).

      (2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:

      (i) Ninety days or more past due;

      (ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

      (iii) In the process of foreclosure;

      (iv) Held as real estate owned;

      (v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:

      (A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or

      (B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or

      (vi) Is in default.

      (3) Parameter A is *th*e attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Except as provided in § 3.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

      (4) Parameter D is *th*e detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 3.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are  with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

      (5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.

      (c)  K and W are used to calculate K, the augmented value of K, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters ***A*** and D, relative to K determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.

      (1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to K, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.

      (2) When the attachment point, parameter *A*, for a securitization position is greater than or equal to K, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (3) When **A** is less than K and D is greater than K, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average of 1.00 and K calculated under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For the purpose of this calculation:

      (i) The weight assigned to 1.00 equals

      § 3.212   Market risk disclosures.

#### § § 3.212

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association must comply with this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a depository institution that is subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. A national bank or Federal savings association must make timely public disclosures each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a national bank or Federal savings association believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed. The national bank's or Federal savings association's management may provide all of the disclosures required by this section in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.

      (b)  The national bank or Federal savings association must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses the national bank's or Federal savings association's approach for determining its market risk disclosures. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart, and the board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this section.

      (c)  (1) For each material portfolio of covered positions, the national bank or Federal savings association must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least quarterly:

      (i) The high, low, and mean VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the VaR-based measure at period-end;

      (ii) The high, low, and mean stressed VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the stressed VaR-based measure at period-end;

      (iii) The high, low, and mean incremental risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the incremental risk capital requirement at period-end;

      (iv) The high, low, and mean comprehensive risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the comprehensive risk capital requirement at period-end, with the period-end requirement broken down into appropriate risk classifications (for example, default risk, migration risk, correlation risk);

      (v) Separate measures for interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk used to calculate the VaR-based measure; and

      (vi) A comparison of VaR-based estimates with actual gains or losses experienced by the national bank or Federal savings association, with an analysis of important outliers.

      (2) In addition, the national bank or Federal savings association must disclose publicly the following information at least quarterly:

      (i) The aggregate amount of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet securitization positions by exposure type; and

      (ii) The aggregate amount of correlation trading positions.

      (d)  For each material portfolio of covered positions, the national bank or Federal savings association must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, or more frequently in the event of material changes for each portfolio:

      (1) The composition of material portfolios of covered positions;

      (2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for covered positions including, for securitization positions, the methods and key assumptions used for valuing such positions, any significant changes since the last reporting period, and the impact of such change;

      (3) The characteristics of the internal models used for purposes of this subpart. For the incremental risk capital requirement and the comprehensive risk capital requirement, this must include:

      (i) The approach used by the national bank or Federal savings association to determine liquidity horizons;

      (ii) The methodologies used to achieve a capital assessment that is consistent with the required soundness standard; and

      (iii) The specific approaches used in the validation of these models;

      (4) A description of the approaches used for validating and evaluating the accuracy of internal models and modeling processes for purposes of this subpart;

      (5) For each market risk category (that is, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk), a description of the stress tests applied to the positions subject to the factor;

      (6) The results of the comparison of the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal estimates for purposes of this subpart with actual outcomes during a sample period not used in model development;

      (7) The soundness standard on which the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal capital adequacy assessment under this subpart is based, including a description of the methodologies used to achieve a capital adequacy assessment that is consistent with the soundness standard;

      (8) A description of the national bank's or Federal savings association's processes for monitoring changes in the credit and market risk of securitization positions, including how those processes differ for resecuritization positions; and

      (9) A description of the national bank's or Federal savings association's policy governing the use of credit risk mitigation to mitigate the risks of securitization and resecuritization positions.

      (1)-(3) [Reserved]

      (4)  (i) Beginning on January 1, 2014, a depository institution that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, and beginning on January 1, 2015, all other depository institutions, may include in regulatory capital debt or equity instruments issued prior to September 12, 2010 that do not meet the criteria for additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments in § 3.20 but that were included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital respectively as of September 12, 2010 (non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to September 12, 2010) up to the percentage of the outstanding principal amount of such non-qualifying capital instruments as of January 1, 2014 in accordance with Table 9 to § 3.300.

      (ii) Table 9 to § 3.300 applies separately to tier 1 and tier 2 non-qualifying capital instruments.

      (iii) The amount of non-qualifying capital instruments that cannot be included in additional tier 1 capital under this section may be included in tier 2 capital without limitation, provided that the instruments meet the criteria for tier 2 capital instruments under § 3.20(d).

      (d) [Reserved]

      (e)  For purposes of 12 CFR part 6, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its capital measures and tangible equity ratio in accordance with the transition provisions in this section.

      (f) A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may apply the treatment under §§ 3.21 and 3.22(c)(2), (5), (6), and (d)(2) applicable to an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association during the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 2020. During the quarter beginning January 1, 2020, a national bank or Federal savings association that makes such an election must deduct 80 percent of the amount otherwise required to be deducted under § 3.22(d)(2) and must apply a 100 percent risk weight to assets not deducted under § 3.22(d)(2). In addition, during the quarter beginning January 1, 2020, a national bank or Federal savings association that makes such an election must include in its regulatory capital 20 percent of any minority interest that exceeds the amount of minority interest includable in regulatory capital under § 3.21 as it applies to an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association. A national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must apply the treatment under §§ 3.21 and 3.22 applicable to a national bank or Federal savings association that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association beginning April 1, 2020, and thereafter.

      (g)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may use CEM rather than SA-CCR for purposes of §§ 3.34(a) and 3.132(c) until January 1, 2022. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must provide prior notice to the OCC if it decides to begin using SA-CCR before January 1, 2022. On January 1, 2022, and thereafter, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must use SA-CCR for purposes of §§ 3.34(a), 3.132(c), and 3.133(d). Once an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association has begun to use SA-CCR, the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association may not change to use CEM.

      (h)  Prior to January 1, 2022, a national bank or Federal savings association that calculates the exposure amounts of its derivative contracts under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk in § 3.132(c) may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a QCCP under either method 1 under § 3.35(d)(3)(i) or method 2 under § 3.35(d)(3)(ii), rather than under § 3.133(d).

#### § § 3.301

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings organization may elect to use a CECL transition provision pursuant to this section only if the national bank or Federal savings association records a reduction in retained earnings due to the adoption of CECL as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that elects to use the CECL transition provision must elect to use the CECL transition provision in the first Call Report that includes CECL filed by the national bank or Federal savings association after it adopts CECL.

      (3) A national bank or Federal savings association that does not elect to use the CECL transition provision as of the first Call Report that includes CECL filed as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may not elect to use the CECL transition provision in subsequent reporting periods.

      (b)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      (1)  means the three-year period beginning the first day of the fiscal year in which a national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL and reflects CECL in its first Call Report filed after that date; or, for the 2020 CECL transition provision under paragraph (d) of this section, the five-year period beginning on the earlier of the date a national bank or Federal savings association was required to adopt CECL for accounting purposes under GAAP (as in effect January 1, 2020), or the first day of the fiscal year that begins during the 2020 calendar year in which the national bank or Federal savings association files regulatory reports that include CECL.

      (2) For purposes of the election described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an advanced approaches or Category III national bank or Federal savings association must make the following additional adjustments to its calculation of its applicable regulatory capital ratios:

      (i) Increase total leverage exposure for purposes of the supplementary leverage ratio by seventy-five percent of its CECL transitional amount during the first year of the transition period, increase total leverage exposure for purposes of the supplementary leverage ratio by fifty percent of its CECL transitional amount during the second year of the transition period, and increase total leverage exposure for purposes of the supplementary leverage ratio by twenty-five percent of its CECL transitional amount during the third year of the transition period; and

      (ii) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d) must decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by seventy-five percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the first year of the transition period, decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by fifty percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the second year of the transition provision, and decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by twenty-five percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the third year of the transition period.

      (d)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that adopts CECL for accounting purposes under GAAP as of the first day of a fiscal year that begins during the 2020 calendar year may elect to use the transitional amounts and modified transitional amounts in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with the 2020 CECL transition provision calculation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to adjust its calculation of regulatory capital ratios during each quarter of the transition period in which a national bank or Federal savings association uses CECL for purposes of its Call Report. A national bank or Federal savings association may use the transition provision in this paragraph (d) if it has a positive modified CECL transitional amount during any quarter ending in 2020, and makes the election in the Call Report filed for the same quarter. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not calculate a positive modified CECL transitional amount in any quarter is not required to apply the adjustments in its calculation of regulatory capital ratios in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in that quarter.

      (i)  means:

      (A) During the first two years of the transition period, the difference between AACL as reported in the most recent Call Report and the AACL as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the CECL transitional amount; and

      (B) During the last three years of the transition period, the difference between AACL as reported in the Call Report at the end of the second year of the transition period and the AACL as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the CECL transitional amount.

      (ii)  means:

      (A) During the first two years of the transition period, the difference between AACL as reported in the most recent Call Report and the AACL as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the AACL transitional amount; and

      (B) During the last three years of the transition period, the difference between AACL as reported in the Call Report at the end of the second year of the transition period and the AACL as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the national bank or Federal savings association adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the AACL transitional amount.

      (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that has elected the 2020 CECL transition provision described in this paragraph (d) may make the following adjustments in its calculation of regulatory capital ratios:

      (A) Increase retained earnings by one-hundred percent of its modified CECL transitional amount during the first year of the transition period, increase retained earnings by one hundred percent of its modified CECL transitional amount during the second year of the transition period, increase retained earnings by seventy-five percent of its modified CECL transitional amount during the third year of the transition period, increase retained earnings by fifty percent of its modified CECL transitional amount during the fourth year of the transition period, and increase retained earnings by twenty-five percent of its modified CECL transitional amount during the fifth year of the transition period;

      (B) An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d) must decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by one-hundred percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the first year of the transition period, decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by one hundred percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the second year of the transition period, decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by seventy-five percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the third year of the transition period, decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by fifty percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the fourth year of the transition period, and decrease amounts of eligible credit reserves by twenty-five percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional amount during the fifth year of the transition period.

      (e)  An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d), and whose amount of expected credit loss exceeded its eligible credit reserves immediately prior to the adoption of CECL, and that has an increase in common equity tier 1 capital as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it adopts CECL after including the first year portion of the CECL transitional amount (or modified CECL transitional amount) must decrease its CECL transitional amount (or modified CECL transitional amount) used in paragraph (c) of this section by the full amount of its DTA transitional amount.

      (f)  Notwithstanding any other requirement in this section, for purposes of this paragraph (f), in the event of a business combination involving a national bank or Federal savings association where one or both of the national banks or Federal savings associations have elected the treatment described in this section:

      (1) If the acquirer national bank or Federal savings association (as determined under GAAP) elected the treatment described in this section, the acquirer national bank or Federal savings association must continue to use the transitional amounts (unaffected by the business combination) that it calculated as of the date that it adopted CECL through the end of its transition period.

      (2) If the acquired insured depository institution (as determined under GAAP) elected the treatment described in this section, any transitional amount of the acquired insured depository institution does not transfer to the resulting national bank or Federal savings association.

    Subpart H—Establishment of Minimum Capital Ratios for an Individual Bank or Individual Federal Savings Association

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 62269, Oct. 11, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 3.401   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 3.401

      The rules and procedures specified in this subpart are applicable to a proceeding to establish required minimum capital ratios that would otherwise be applicable to a national bank or Federal savings association under subpart B of this part. The OCC is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s)(2) and 3907(a)(2) to establish such minimum capital requirements for a national bank or Federal savings association as the OCC, in its discretion, deems appropriate in light of the particular circumstances at that national bank or Federal savings association. Proceedings under this subpart also may be initiated to require a national bank or Federal savings association having capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part, or other legal authority to continue to maintain those higher ratios.

      § 3.402   Applicability.

#### § § 3.402

      The OCC may require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual national bank or Federal savings association in view of its circumstances. For example, higher capital ratios may be appropriate for:

      (a) A newly chartered national bank or Federal savings association;

      (b) A national bank or Federal savings association receiving special supervisory attention;

      (c) A national bank or Federal savings association that has, or is expected to have, losses resulting in capital inadequacy;

      (d) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure due to the risks from concentrations of credit, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, or management's overall inability to monitor and control financial and operating risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities;

      (e) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates;

      (f) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure due to fiduciary or operational risk;

      (g) A national bank or Federal savings association exposed to a high degree of asset depreciation, or a low level of liquid assets in relation to short term liabilities;

      (h) A national bank or Federal savings association exposed to a high volume of, or particularly severe, problem loans;

      (i) A national bank or Federal savings association that is growing rapidly, either internally or through acquisitions; or

      (j) A national bank or Federal savings association that may be adversely affected by the activities or condition of its holding company, affiliate(s), or other persons or institutions, including chain banking organizations, with which it has significant business relationships.

      § 3.403   Standards for determination of appropriate individual minimum capital ratios.

#### § § 3.403

      The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual national bank or Federal savings association cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:

      (a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the OCC's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are appropriate or necessary for the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;

      (c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the national bank or Federal savings association and, if applicable, its holding company and/or affiliate(s);

      (d) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity, capital, risk asset and other ratios compared to the ratios of its peer group; and

      (e) The views of the national bank's or Federal savings association's directors and senior management.

      § 3.404   Procedures.

#### § § 3.404

      (a)  When the OCC determines that minimum capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part or other legal authority are necessary or appropriate for a particular national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC will notify the national bank or Federal savings association in writing of the proposed minimum capital ratios and the date by which they should be reached (if applicable) and will provide an explanation of why the ratios proposed are considered necessary or appropriate for the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (b)  (1) The national bank or Federal savings association may respond to any or all of the items in the notice. The response should include any matters which the national bank or Federal savings association would have the OCC consider in deciding whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association, what those capital ratios should be, and, if applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated OCC official within 30 days after the date on which the national bank or Federal savings association received the notice. The OCC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the OCC, the condition of the national bank or Federal savings association so requires, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association is informed promptly of the new time period, or with the consent of the national bank or Federal savings association. In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.

      (2) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the OCC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed minimum capital ratios or the deadline for their achievement.

      (c)  After the close of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response period, the OCC will decide, based on a review of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response and other information concerning the national bank or Federal savings association, whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association and, if so, the ratios and the date the requirements will become effective. The national bank or Federal savings association will be notified of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision, except for a decision not to establish individual minimum capital requirements for the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (d)  The decision may require the national bank or Federal savings association to develop and submit to the OCC, within a time period specified, an acceptable plan to reach the minimum capital ratios established for the national bank or Federal savings association by the date required.

      (e)  If, after the OCC's decision in paragraph (c) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required minimum capital ratios by the specified date, the national bank or Federal savings association may propose to the OCC, or the OCC may propose to the national bank or Federal savings association, a change in the minimum capital ratios for the national bank or Federal savings association, the date when the minimums must be achieved, or the national bank's or Federal savings association's plan (if applicable). The OCC may decline to consider proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the OCC's original decision and any plan required under that decision shall continue in full force and effect.

      § 3.405   Relation to other actions.

#### § § 3.405

      In lieu of, or in addition to, the procedures in this subpart, the required minimum capital ratios for a national bank or Federal savings association may be established or revised through a written agreement or cease and desist proceedings under 12 U.S.C. 1818 (b) or (c) (12 CFR part 19) or as a condition for approval of an application.

      (5) A combination of any of these or similar actions.

      (b) A directive issued under this rule, including a plan submitted under a directive, is enforceable under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818(i) in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) that has become final. Violation of a directive may result in assessment of civil money penalties in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).

      (2) With the consent of the national bank or Federal savings association; or

      (3) When the national bank or Federal savings association already has advised the OCC that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital ratios.

      (b) In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.

      (c) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the OCC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed directive.

#### § § 3.606

      Upon a change in circumstances, a national bank or Federal savings association may request the OCC to reconsider the terms of its directive or may propose changes in the plan to achieve the national bank's or Federal savings association's applicable minimum capital ratios. The OCC also may take such action on its own motion. The OCC may decline to consider requests or proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the directive and plan shall continue in full force and effect.

      § 3.607   Relation to other administrative actions.

#### § § 3.607

      A directive may be issued in addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including cease and desist proceedings, civil money penalties, or the conditioning or denial of applications.

      (iv) The condition of the foreign bank gives rise to such a need.

Finally, this subpart describes the fees that the OCC assesses for the services it renders in providing information under the FOIA (§ 4.17).

      (3) This subpart does not apply to a request for records pursuant to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). A person requesting records from the OCC pursuant to the Privacy Act should refer to 31 CFR part 1, subpart C, and appendix J of subpart C.

> [60 FR 57322, Nov. 15, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 43561, July 21, 2011; 81 FR 94244, Dec. 23, 2016]

      § 4.12   Information available under the FOIA.

#### § § 4.12

      (a)  Except as otherwise provided by the FOIA, OCC and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) records are available to the public.

      (b)  The following records, or portions thereof, are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA:

      (1) A record that is specifically authorized, under criteria established by an Executive order, to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and that is properly classified pursuant to that Executive order;

      (2) A record relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

      (3) A record specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552b), provided that the statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; establishes particular criteria for withholding, or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and, if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3);

      (4) A record that is privileged or contains trade secrets, or commercial or financial information, furnished in confidence, that relates to the business, personal, or financial affairs of any person (see § 4.16 for notice requirements regarding disclosure of confidential commercial information);

      (5) An intra-agency or interagency memorandum or letter not routinely available by law to a private party in litigation, including memoranda, reports, and other documents prepared by OCC employees, and records of deliberations and discussions at meetings of OCC employees, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

      (6) A personnel, medical, or similar record, including a financial record, or any portion thereof, where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (7) A record or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the OCC reasonably believes that producing the record or information may:

      (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

      (ii) Deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

      (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority, or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis;

      (v) Disclose information furnished by a confidential source, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation;

      (vi) Disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure reasonably could be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or

      (vii) Endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

      (8) A record contained in or related to an examination, operating, or condition report prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the OCC or any other agency responsible for regulating or supervising financial institutions; and

      (9) A record containing or relating to geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

      (c)  Even if a record is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section, the OCC may elect, on a case-by-case basis, not to apply the exemption to the requested record. The OCC's election not to apply an exemption to a requested record has no precedential significance as to the application or nonapplication of the exemption to any other requested record, regardless of who requests the record or when the OCC receives the request. The OCC will provide predisclosure notice to submitters of confidential commercial information in accordance with § 4.16.

      (d)  If the OCC determines that full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, the OCC considers whether partial disclosure of information is possible and takes reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. The OCC will note the location and extent of any deletion, and identify the FOIA exemption under which material has been deleted, on the released portion of the material, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption under paragraph (b) of this section pursuant to which the deletion was made. Where technically feasible, the amount of information redacted and the exemption pursuant to which the redaction was made will be indicated at the site(s) of the deletion.

      (i)  The OCC may extend the time limits in unusual circumstances for a maximum of 10 business days. If the OCC extends the time limits, the OCC provides written notice to the person making the request or appeal, containing the reason for the extension and the date on which the OCC expects to make a determination. Unusual circumstances exist when the OCC requires additional time to:

      (A) Search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other buildings that are separate from the office processing the request or appeal;

      (B) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of requested records;

      (C) Consult with another agency that has a substantial interest in the determination of the request; or

      (D) Allow two or more components of the OCC that have substantial interest in the determination of the request to consult with each other;

      (ii)  A requester may agree to extend the time limits for any amount of time;

      (iii)  If a requester commences an action pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section for failure to comply with the time limits set forth in this paragraph (f), a court with jurisdiction may, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C), allow the OCC additional time to complete the review of the records requested, or

      (iv)  (A) The OCC may toll the 20-day time period to:

      () Make one request for additional information from the requester; or

      () Clarify the applicability or amount of any fees, if necessary, with the requester.

      (B) The tolling period ends upon the OCC's receipt of requested information from the requester or resolution of the fee issue.

      (4)  If the OCC determines unusual circumstances apply to a request for records, and the OCC determines it cannot respond to the request within the 10-day extension set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the OCC will:

      (i) Notify the requester that the request cannot be processed within the time limit set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section;

      (ii) Provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that 10-day period or to arrange with the OCC an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request;

      (iii) Make available the FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the OCC; and

      (iv) Notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

      (g)  The date of receipt of a request for records or an appeal is the date that Disclosure Services, Communications Division receives a request that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section, except as provided in § 4.17(d).

      (h)  Requesters with concerns about the handling of their FOIA requests may contact the FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services for dispute resolution services.

      (1) To apply for dispute resolution assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison, requesters should submit a written request to the FOIA Public Liaison, Communications Division, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20219.

      (2) For dispute resolution services through the Office of Government Services, requesters should contact the Office of Government Services as set forth at 36 CFR 1250.32.

      § 4.16   Predisclosure notice for confidential commercial information.

#### § § 4.16

      (a)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      (1)  means records that arguably contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); § 4.12(b)(4)), because disclosure reasonably could cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter.

      (2)  means any person or entity that provides confidential commercial information to the OCC. This term includes corporations, State governments, foreign governments, and banks and their employees, officers, directors, and principal shareholders.

      (b) —(1)  In accordance with Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235), when the OCC receives a request under § 4.15(c) or, where appropriate, an appeal under § 4.15(d) for disclosure of confidential commercial information, the OCC provides a submitter with prompt written notice of the receipt of that request (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) in the following circumstances:

      (i) With respect to confidential commercial information submitted to the OCC or to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the predecessor of the OTS, prior to January 1, 1988, if:

      (A) The records are less than 10 years old and the submitter designated the information as confidential commercial information;

      (B) The OCC reasonably believes that disclosure of the information may cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter; or

      (C) The information is subject to a prior express commitment of confidentiality from the OCC or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the predecessor of the OTS; and

      (ii) With respect to confidential commercial information submitted to the OCC or to the OTS (or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, its predecessor agency) on or after January 1, 1988, if:

      (A) The submitter in good faith designated the information as confidential commercial information;

      (B) The OCC or the OTS (or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, its predecessor agency) designated the class of information to which the requested information belongs as confidential commercial information; or

      (C) The OCC reasonably believes that disclosure of the information may cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter.

      (2)  The OCC generally does not provide notice under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the OCC determines that:

      (i) It will not disclose the information;

      (ii) The information already has been disclosed officially to the public;

      (iii) The OCC is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) to disclose the information;

      (iv) The OCC or the OTS (or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, its predecessor agency) acquired the information in the course of a lawful investigation of a possible violation of criminal law;

      (v) The submitter had an opportunity to designate the requested information as confidential commercial information at the time of submission of the information or a reasonable time thereafter and did not do so, unless the OCC has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or

      (vi) The OCC determines that the submitter's designation under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is frivolous; in such case, however, the OCC will provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative determination to disclose the information at least 10 business days prior to the date that the OCC intends to disclose the information.

      (3)  The OCC either describes in the notice the exact nature of the confidential commercial information requested or includes with the notice copies of the records or portions of records containing that information.

      (4)  The OCC provides notice under this paragraph (b) with respect to information that the submitter designated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section only for a period of 10 years after the date of the submitter's designation, unless the submitter requests and justifies to the OCC's satisfaction a specific notice period of greater duration.

      (5)  If possible, the submitter should support the claim of confidentiality with a statement or certification that the requested information is confidential commercial information that the submitter has not disclosed to the public. This statement should be prepared by an officer or authorized representative if the submitter is a corporation or other entity.

      (c)  If the OCC provides notice to a submitter under paragraph (b) of this section, the OCC notifies the person requesting confidential commercial information (requester) that it has provided notice to the submitter. The OCC also advises the requester that if there is a delay in its decision whether to grant or deny access to the information sought, the delay may be considered a denial of access to the information, and that the requester may proceed with an administrative appeal or seek judicial review. However, the requester may agree to a voluntary extension of time to allow the OCC to review the submitter's objection to disclosure (see § 4.15(f)(3)(ii)).

      (d)  Within 10 days after receiving notice under paragraph (b) of this section, the submitter may provide the OCC with a detailed statement of objection to disclosure of the information. That statement must specify the grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA. Any statement that the submitter provides under this paragraph (d) may be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (e)  The OCC considers carefully a submitter's objection and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the requested information. If the OCC decides to disclose information over the objection of the submitter, the OCC provides to the submitter, with a copy to the requester, a written notice that includes:

      (1) A statement of the OCC's reasons for not sustaining the submitter's objections to disclosure;

      (2) A description of the information to be disclosed;

      (3) The anticipated disclosure date, which is not less than 10 business days after the OCC mails the written notice required under this paragraph (e); and

      (4) A statement that the submitter must notify the OCC immediately if the submitter intends to seek injunctive relief.

      (f)  Whenever the OCC receives service of process indicating that a requester has brought suit seeking to compel the OCC to disclose information covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the OCC promptly notifies the submitter.

      § 4.17   FOIA request fees.

#### § § 4.17

      (a)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      (1)  means those expenditures that the OCC incurs in providing services (including searching for, reviewing, and duplicating records) in response to a request for records under § 4.15.

      (2)  means the process of locating a record in response to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within a record. The OCC may perform a search manually or by electronic means.

      (3)  means the process of examining a record located in response to a request to determine which portions of that record should be released. It also includes processing a record for disclosure.

      (4)  means the process of copying a record in response to a request. A copy may take the form of a paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable material (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.

      (5)  means a person who seeks records for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.

      (6)  means a person who seeks records on behalf of a public or private educational institution, including a preschool, an elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research.

      (7)  means a person who is not a “commercial use requester,” as that term is defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and who seeks records on behalf of an institution operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.

      (8)  means any person who, or entity that, gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by that entity. A publication contract is one example of a basis for expecting publication that ordinarily would satisfy this standard. The OCC also may consider the past publication record of the requester in determining whether she or he qualifies as a “representative of the news media.”

      (b) —(1)  The hourly and per page rate that the OCC generally charges requesters is set forth in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency _Fees_” (Notice) described in 12 CFR 8.8. Any interested person may request a copy of the Notice from the OCC by mail or may obtain a copy at the location described in § 4.14(c). The OCC may contract with a commercial service to search for, duplicate, or disseminate records, provided that the OCC determines that the fee assessed upon a requester is no greater than if the OCC performed the tasks itself. The OCC does not contract out responsibilities that the FOIA provides that the OCC alone may discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption or whether to waive or reduce a fee.

      (2)  The OCC assesses a fee based on the fee category in which the OCC places the requester. If the request states how the requester intends to use the requested records (see § 4.15(c)(1)(iv)), the OCC may place the requester in a lower fee category; otherwise, the OCC categorizes the requester as a “commercial use requester.” If the OCC reasonably doubts the requester's stated intended use, or if that use is not clear from the request, the OCC may place the requester in the “commercial use” category or may seek additional clarification. The fee categories are as follows:

      (i)  The OCC assesses a fee for a requester in this category for the actual cost of search, review, and duplication. A requester in this category does not receive any free search, review, or duplication services.

      (ii)  The OCC assesses a fee for a requester in this category for the actual cost of duplication. A requester in this category receives 100 free pages.

      (iii)  The OCC assesses a fee for a requester who does not fit into either of the above categories for the actual cost of search and duplication. A requester in this category receives 100 free pages and two hours of free search time.

      (3)  The OCC may, in its discretion, accommodate a request for special services. The OCC may recover the actual cost of providing any special services.

      (4)  The OCC may waive or reduce a fee under this section whenever, in its opinion, disclosure of records is in the public interest because the disclosure:

      (i) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and

      (ii) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (5)  The OCC may assess a fee for time spent searching for records, even if the OCC does not locate the records requested.

      (6)  The OCC will not assess search or duplication fees, as applicable, if it fails to respond to a requester's FOIA request within the time limits specified under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) and 12 CFR 4.15(f), except as follows:

      (i) —(A)  If the OCC has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and § 4.15(f)(3)(i)) apply and the OCC provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the OCC may assess search or duplication fees, as applicable, for an additional 10 days. If the OCC fails to comply with the extended time limit, the OCC will not assess any search or duplication fees, as applicable.

      (B)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section, if the OCC has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and § 4.15(f)(3)(i)) apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the OCC may assess search or duplication fees, as appropriate, if the OCC provides a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and discusses with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or makes not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

      (ii)  If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C)) apply to the processing of a request, the OCC may assess search or duplication fees, as applicable, for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (c) —(1)  The OCC generally assesses a fee when it delivers the records in response to the request, if any. A requester must send payment within 30 calendar days of the billing date to the Financial Management, Accounts Receivable, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20219.

      (2)  If the OCC estimates that a fee is likely to exceed $25, the OCC notifies the requester of the estimated fee, unless the requester has indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee as high as the estimated fee. If so notified by the OCC, the requester may confer with OCC employees to revise the request to reflect a lower fee.

      (3)  If the OCC estimates that a fee is likely to exceed $250, the OCC notifies the requester of the estimated fee. In this circumstance, the OCC may require, as a condition to processing the request, that the requester:

      (i) Provide satisfactory assurance of full payment, if the requester has a history of prompt payment; or

      (ii) Pay the estimated fee in full, if the requester does not have a history of prompt payment.

      (4)  If the requester fails to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of the billing, the OCC may require, as a condition to processing any further request, that the requester pay any unpaid fee, plus interest (as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), and any estimated fee in full for that further request.

      (5)  The OCC may assess interest charges on an unpaid fee beginning on the 31st day following the billing date. The OCC charges interest at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

      (d)  Under the circumstances described in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the time limits set forth in § 4.15(f) ( 20 business days from the receipt of a request for records and 20 business days from the receipt of an administrative appeal, plus any permissible extension) begin only after the OCC receives a revised request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an assurance of payment under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, or the required payments under paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(4) of this section.

      (e)  When the OCC reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of a fee, the OCC may aggregate the requests and assess a fee accordingly.

      § 4.18   How to track a FOIA request.

#### § § 4.18

      (a) —(1)  The OCC will issue a tracking number to all FOIA requesters automatically upon receipt of the request (as described in § 4.15(g)) by the OCC's Communications Division via the OCC's Freedom of Information Request Portal,  The tracking number will be sent via electronic mail to the requester.

      (2)  The OCC will issue a tracking number to FOIA requesters without Internet access within 5 days of the receipt of the request (as described in § 4.15(g)) in the OCC's Communications Division. The OCC will mail the tracking number to the requester's physical address, as provided in the FOIA request.

      (b)  FOIA requesters may track the progress of their requests via the OCC's Freedom of Information Request Portal,  Requesters without Internet access may continue to contact the Chief FOIA Officer, Communications Division, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at (202) 649-6700 to check the status of their FOIA request(s).

      (1) In a civil action, to the Director of the OCC's Litigation Division at the Washington office; or

      (2) In a criminal action, to the appropriate district counsel or the Director of the OCC's Enforcement Division at the Washington office.

      § 4.35   Consideration of requests.

#### § § 4.35

      (a) —(1)  The OCC decides whether to release non-public OCC information based on its weighing of all appropriate factors including the requestor's fulfilling of the requirements enumerated in § 4.33. Each decision is at the sole discretion of the Comptroller or the Comptroller's delegate and is a final agency decision. OCC action on a request for non-public OCC information exhausts administrative remedies for discovery of the information.

      (2)  The OCC may deny a request for non-public OCC information for reasons that include the following:

      (i) The requester was unsuccessful in showing that the information is relevant to the pending matter;

      (ii) The requester seeks testimony and the requestor did not show a compelling need for the information;

      (iii) The request arises from an adversarial matter and other evidence reasonably suited to the requester's need is available from another source;

      (iv) A lawsuit or administrative action has not yet been filed and the request was made in connection with potential litigation;

      (v) The production of the information would be contrary to the public interest or unduly burdensome to the OCC; or

      (vi) When prohibited by law.

      (3)  A requester must submit a complete request. The OCC may require the requester to provide additional information to complete a request. Consistent with the purposes stated in § 4.31, the OCC may inquire into the circumstances of any case underlying the request and rely on sources of information other than the requester, including other parties.

      (4)  The OCC generally will process requests in the order in which they are received. The OCC will notify the requester in writing of the final decision. Absent exigent or unusual circumstances, the OCC will respond to a request within 60 days from the date that the OCC receives a request that it deems a complete request. Consistent with § 4.33(a)(2), the OCC weighs a request to respond to provide information in less than 60 days against the unfairness to other requesters whose pending requests may be delayed and the burden imposed on the OCC by the expedited processing.

      (5)  Following receipt of a request for non-public OCC information, the OCC generally notifies the national bank or Federal savings association that is the subject of the requested information, unless the OCC, in its discretion, determines that to do so would advantage or prejudice any of the parties in the matter at issue.

      (b)  (1) The OCC generally will not authorize a current OCC employee to provide expert or opinion evidence for a private party.

      (2) The OCC may restrict the scope of any authorized testimony and may act to ensure that the scope of testimony given by the OCC employee adheres to the scope authorized by the OCC.

      (3) Once a request for testimony has been submitted, and before the requested testimony occurs, a party to the relevant case, who did not join in the request and who wishes to question the witness beyond the scope of testimony sought by the request, shall timely submit the party's own request for OCC information pursuant to this subpart.

      (4) The OCC may offer the requester the employee's written declaration in lieu of testimony.

      (c)  In appropriate cases, the OCC may respond to a request for information by authorizing a party to the case who is in possession of non-public OCC information to release the information to the requester. An OCC authorization to release records does not preclude the party in possession from asserting its own privilege, arguing that the records are not relevant, or asserting any other argument for which it has standing to protect the records from release.

      § 4.36   Disclosure of non-public OCC information.

#### § § 4.36

      (a)  The OCC may make non-public OCC information available to a supervised entity and to other persons, that in the sole discretion of the Comptroller may be necessary or appropriate, without a request for records or testimony.

      (b)  It is the OCC's policy regarding non-public OCC information that such information is confidential and privileged. Accordingly, the OCC will not normally disclose this information to third parties.

      (c)  The OCC may impose any conditions or limitations on disclosures under this section, including the restrictions on dissemination contained in § 4.38, that it determines are necessary to effect the purposes of this section.

      (d)  All non-public OCC information remains the property of the OCC. No supervised entity, government agency, person, or other party to whom the information is made available, or any officer, director, employee, or agent thereof, may disclose non-public OCC information without the prior written permission of the OCC, except in published statistical material that does not disclose, either directly or when used in conjunction with other publicly available information, the affairs of any individual, corporation, or other entity. Except as authorized by the OCC, no person obtaining access to non-public OCC information under this section may make a copy of the information and no person may remove non-public OCC information from the premises of the institution, agency, or other party in authorized possession of the information.

      § 4.37   Persons and entities with access to OCC information; prohibition on dissemination.

#### § § 4.37

      (a) —(1)  Except as authorized by this subpart or otherwise by the OCC, no current or former OCC employee or agent or former OTS employee or agent, may, in any manner, disclose or permit the disclosure of any non-public OCC information to anyone other than an employee or agent of the Comptroller for use in the performance of OCC duties.

      (2)  Any current or former OCC employee or agent or former OTS employee or agent, subpoenaed or otherwise requested to provide information covered by this subpart must immediately notify the OCC as provided in this paragraph. The OCC may intervene, attempt to have the compulsory process withdrawn, and register appropriate objections when a current or former OCC employee or agent or former OTS employee or agent, receives a subpoena and the subpoena requires the current or former employee or agent to appear or produce OCC information. If necessary, the current or former employee or agent must appear as required and respectfully decline to produce the information sought, citing this subpart as authority and United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). The current or former OCC employee or agent or former OTS employee or agent, must immediately notify the OCC if subpoenaed or otherwise asked for non-public OCC information:

      (i) In a civil action, by notifying the Director of the OCC's Litigation Division at the Washington office; or

      (ii) In a criminal action, by notifying the appropriate district counsel for current and former district employees or agents; or the Director of the OCC's Enforcement Division at the Washington office, for current and former Washington employees or agents and former OTS employees or agents.

      (b) —(1)  (i) Without OCC approval, no person, national bank, Federal savings association, or other entity, including one in lawful possession of non-public OCC information under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may disclose information covered by this subpart in any manner, except:

      (A) After the requester has sought the information from the OCC pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subpart; and

      (B) As ordered by a Federal court in a judicial proceeding in which the OCC has had the opportunity to appear and oppose discovery.

      (ii) Any person who discloses or uses non-public OCC information except as expressly permitted by the Comptroller of the Currency or as ordered by a Federal court, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be subject to the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641.

      (2)  When necessary or appropriate for business purposes, a national bank, Federal savings association, or holding company, or any director, officer, or employee thereof, may disclose non-public OCC information, including information contained in, or related to, OCC reports of examination, to a person or organization officially connected with the bank or Federal savings association as officer, director, employee, attorney, auditor, or independent auditor. A national bank, Federal savings association, or holding company or a director, officer, or employee thereof, may also release non-public OCC information to a consultant under this paragraph if the consultant is under a written contract to provide services to the bank or Federal savings association and the consultant has a written agreement with the bank or Federal savings association in which the consultant:

      (i) States its awareness of, and agreement to abide by, the prohibition on the dissemination of non-public OCC information contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

      (ii) Agrees not to use the non-public OCC information for any purpose other than as provided under its contract to provide services to the bank or Federal savings association.

      (3)  Any person, national bank, Federal savings association, or other entity served with a request, subpoena, order, motion to compel, or other judicial or administrative process to provide non-public OCC information shall:

      (i) Immediately notify the Director of the OCC's Litigation Division at the Washington, DC office and inform the Director of all relevant facts, including the documents and information requested, so that the OCC may intervene in the judicial or administrative action if appropriate;

      (ii) Inform the requester of the substance of these rules and, in particular, of the obligation to follow the request procedures in §§ 4.33 and 4.34; and

      (iii) At the appropriate time, inform the court or tribunal that issued the process of the substance of these rules.

      (4)  Following receipt of notice pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the OCC may direct the requester to comply with §§ 4.33 and 4.34, intervene in the judicial or administrative action, attempt to have the compulsory process withdrawn, or register other appropriate objections.

      (5)  The OCC may require any person in possession of OCC records to return the records to the OCC.

      (c)  When not prohibited by law, the Comptroller may make available to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and, in the Comptroller's sole discretion, to certain other government agencies of the United States and foreign governments, state agencies with authority to investigate violations of criminal law, and state bank and state savings association regulatory agencies, a copy of a report of examination, testimony, or other non-public OCC information for their use, when necessary, in the performance of their official duties. All non-public OCC information made available pursuant to this paragraph is OCC property, and the OCC may condition its use on appropriate confidentiality protections, including the mechanisms identified in § 4.38.

      (d)  The possession by any of the entities or individuals described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section of non-public OCC information does not constitute a waiver by the OCC of its right to control, or impose limitations on, the subsequent use and dissemination of the information.

      § 4.38   Restrictions on dissemination of released information.

#### § § 4.38

      (a)  The OCC may condition a decision to release non-public OCC information on entry of a protective order by the court or administrative tribunal presiding in the particular case or, in non-adversarial matters, on a written agreement of confidentiality. In a case in which a protective order has already been entered, the OCC may condition approval for release of non-public OCC information upon the inclusion of additional or amended provisions in the protective order. The OCC may authorize a party who obtained records for use in one case to provide them to another party in another case.

      (b)  The OCC may condition its authorization of deposition testimony on an agreement of the parties to appropriate limitations, such as an agreement to keep the transcript of the testimony under seal or to make the transcript available only to the parties, the court, and the jury. Upon request or on its own initiative, the OCC may allow use of a transcript in other litigation. The OCC may require the requester, at the requester's expense, to furnish the OCC with a copy of the transcript. The OCC employee whose deposition was transcribed does not waive his or her right to review the transcript and to note errors.

      (b)  The requester shall promptly notify other parties to a case of the release of non-public OCC information obtained pursuant to this subpart, and, upon entry of a protective order, shall provide copies of OCC information, including OCC information obtained pursuant to § 4.15, to the other parties.

      (c)  At the conclusion of an action:

      (1) The requester shall retrieve any non-public OCC information from the court's file as soon as the court no longer requires the information;

      (2) Each party shall destroy the non-public OCC information covered by the protective order; and

      (3) Each party shall certify to the OCC that the non-public OCC information covered by the protective order has been destroyed.

      (d)  Upon request, the OCC authenticates released records to facilitate their use as evidence. Requesters who require authenticated records or certificates of nonexistence of records should, as early as possible, request certificates from the OCC's Litigation Division pursuant to § 4.34(a).

The OCC may require a requester to remit payment prior to providing the requested information.

      (b)  A person whose request for testimony of a current OCC employee is approved shall, upon completion of the testimonial appearance, tender promptly to the OCC payment for the witness fees and mileage. The litigant shall compute these amounts in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821. A litigant whose request for testimony of a former OCC employee is approved shall tender promptly to the witness any witness fees or mileage due in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821.

L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, 529 (12 U.S.C. 1833e(c)) and consistent with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 701 ), this subpart establishes the OCC Minority- , Women- , and Individuals with Disabilities-Owned Business Contracting Outreach Program (Outreach Program). The Outreach Program is intended to ensure that firms owned and operated by minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to participate, to the maximum extent possible, in all contracting activities of the OCC.

#### § § 4.63

      The OCC's policy is to ensure that MWOBs and IDOBs have the opportunity to participate, to the maximum extent possible, in contracts awarded by the OCC. The OCC awards contracts consistent with the principles of full and open competition and best value acquisition, and with the concept of contracting for agency needs at the lowest practicable cost. The OCC ensures that MWOBs and IDOBs have the opportunity to participate fully in all contracting activities that the OCC enters into for goods and services, whether generated by the headquarters office in Washington, DC, or any other office of the OCC. Contracting opportunities may include small purchase awards, contracts above the small purchase threshold, and delivery orders issued against other governmental agency contracts.

      § 4.64   Promotion.

#### § § 4.64

      (a)  The OCC, under the direction of the Deputy Comptroller for Resource Management, engages in promotion and outreach activities designed to identify MWOBs and IDOBs capable of providing goods and services needed by the OCC, to facilitate interaction between the OCC and the MWOBs and IDOBs community, and to indicate the OCC's commitment to doing business with that community. The Outreach Program is designed to facilitate OCC's participation in business promotion events sponsored by other government agencies and attended by minorities, women and individuals with disabilities. Once the OCC has identified a prospective participant, it will assist the minority- or women-owned business or individual with disabilities-owned business in understanding the OCC's needs and contracting process.

      (b)  OCC's Outreach Program includes the following:

      (1) Obtaining various lists and directories of MWOBs and IDOBs maintained by government agencies;

      (2) Contacting appropriate firms for participation in the OCC's Outreach Program;

      (3) Participating in business promotion events comprised of or attended by MWOBs and IDOBs to explain OCC contracting opportunities and to obtain names of potential MWOBs and IDOBs;

      (4) Ensuring that the OCC contracting staff understands and actively promotes this Outreach Program; and

      (5) Registering MWOBs and IDOBs in the Department of the Treasury's database to facilitate their participation in the competitive procurement process for OCC contracts. This database is used by OCC procurement staff to identify firms to be solicited for OCC procurements.

      § 4.65   Certification.

#### § § 4.65

      (a)  To preserve the integrity and foster the Outreach Program's objectives, each prospective MWOB or IDOB must demonstrate that it meets the ownership and control requirements for participation in the Outreach Program.

      (a)  A depository institution must file an application or notice with the OCC to engage in corporate activities and transactions as described in this part.

      (b)  Forms and instructions for filing are available at .

      (c)  At the request of the filer, the OCC may accept an application or other filing submitted to another Federal agency that covers the proposed action or transaction and contains substantially the same information as required by the OCC. The OCC also may require the filer to submit supplemental information.

      (d)  A filer should address a filing or other submission under this part to the appropriate OCC licensing office or appropriate OCC supervisory office, unless the OCC advises a filer otherwise. Relevant addresses are listed on .

      (e)  A filer may incorporate any material contained in any other application or filing filed with the OCC or other Federal agency by reference, provided that the material is attached to the application and is current and responsive to the information requested by the OCC. The filing must clearly indicate that the information is so incorporated and include a cross-reference to the information incorporated.

      (f)  Before submitting a filing to the OCC, a potential filer is encouraged to contact the appropriate OCC licensing office to determine the need for a prefiling meeting. The OCC decides whether to require a prefiling meeting on a case-by-case basis. Submission of a draft business plan or other relevant information before any prefiling meeting may expedite the filing review process. A potential filer considering a novel, complex, or unique proposal is encouraged to contact the appropriate OCC licensing office to schedule a prefiling meeting early in the development of its proposal for the early identification and consideration of policy issues. Information on model business plans can be found in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual.

      (g)  A filer must certify that any filing or supporting material submitted to the OCC contains no material misrepresentations or omissions. The OCC may review and verify any information filed in connection with a notice or an application. Any person responsible for any material misrepresentation or omission in a filing or supporting materials may be subject to enforcement action and other penalties, including criminal penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

#### § § 5.8

      (a)  A filer must publish a public notice of its filing in a newspaper of general circulation in the community in which the filer proposes to engage in business, on the date of filing, or as soon as practicable before or after the date of filing. This notice must be published in the English language but if the OCC determines that the primary language of a significant number of adult residents of the community is a language other than English, the OCC may require that an additional notice(s) simultaneously be published in the community in the appropriate language(s).

      (b)  The public notice must state that a filing is being made, the date of the filing, the name and address of the filer, the subject matter of the filing (including the name of the institution that is the subject of the filing), that the public may submit comments to the appropriate OCC licensing office, the address of the appropriate OCC licensing office where comments should be sent, the closing date of the public comment period (if known at the time of publication of the notice), that the public portion of the filing is available on request, that the public may find information about the filing (including the closing date of the comment period) in the OCC's Weekly Bulletin available at , and any other information that the OCC requires.

      (c)  Promptly following publication, the filer must mail or otherwise deliver to the appropriate OCC licensing office a statement containing the date of publication, the name and address of the newspaper that published the public notice, a copy of the public notice, and any other information that the OCC requires.

      (d)  The OCC may consider more than one transaction, or a series of transactions, to be a single filing for purposes of the publication requirements of this section.

      (e)  Upon the request of a filer, for a transaction subject to a public notice requirement of both the OCC and another Federal agency, the OCC may accept publication of a single joint notice containing the information required by both the OCC and the other Federal agency, provided that the notice states that comments must be submitted to both the OCC and, if applicable, the other Federal agency.

      (f)  In addition to the foregoing, the OCC may require or give public notice and request comment on any filing and in any manner the OCC determines appropriate for the particular filing.

      (g)  At the OCC's discretion, a filer may be required to publish a new public notice if:

      (1) The filer submits either a revised filing or new or additional information related to a filing;

      (2) A major issue of law or change in circumstance arises after a filing; or

      (3) The OCC determines that a new public notice is appropriate.

      § 5.9   Public availability.

#### § § 5.9

      (a)  The OCC provides a copy of the public file to any person who requests it. A requestor should submit a written request for the public file concerning a pending filing to the appropriate OCC licensing office. A requestor should submit a written request for the public file concerning a decided or closed filing to the OCC's Freedom of Information Act Officer, Communications Division, at the address listed on . The OCC may impose a fee in accordance with 12 CFR 4.17 and at the rate the OCC publishes in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees,” described in 12 CFR 8.8.

      (b)  A public file consists of the portions of the filing, supporting data, supplementary information, and information submitted by interested persons, to the extent that those documents have not been afforded confidential treatment. Filers and other interested persons may request that confidential treatment be afforded information submitted to the OCC pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (c)  The filer or an interested person submitting information may request that specific information be treated as confidential under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 ( 12 CFR 4.12(b)). A submitter should draft its request for confidential treatment narrowly to extend only to those portions of a document it considers confidential. If a submitter requests confidential treatment for information that the OCC does not consider to be confidential, the OCC may include that information in the public file after providing notice to the submitter. Moreover, at its own initiative, the OCC may determine that certain information should be treated as confidential and withhold that information from the public file. A person requesting information withheld from the public file should submit the request to the OCC's Freedom of Information Act Officer, Communications Division, under the procedures described in 12 CFR part 4, subpart B. That request may be subject to the predisclosure notice procedures of 12 CFR 4.16.

      § 5.10   Comments.

#### § § 5.10

      (a)  During the comment period, any person may submit written comments on a filing to the appropriate OCC licensing office.

      (b) —(1)  Unless otherwise stated, the comment period is 30 days after publication of the public notice required by § 5.8(a). If a new public notice is required under § 5.8(g), the OCC may require a new comment period of up to 30 days after publication of the new public notice.

      (2)  The OCC may extend a comment period if:

      (i) The filer fails to file all required publicly available information on a timely basis to permit review by interested persons or makes a request for confidential treatment not granted by the OCC that delays the public availability of that information;

      (ii) Any person requesting an extension of time satisfactorily demonstrates to the OCC that additional time is necessary to develop factual information that the OCC determines is necessary to consider the filing; or

      (iii) The OCC determines that other extenuating circumstances exist.

      (3)  The OCC may give the filer an opportunity to respond to comments received.

      § 5.11   Hearings and other meetings.

#### § § 5.11

      (a)  Prior to the end of the comment period, any person may submit to the appropriate OCC office a written request for a hearing on a filing. The request must describe the nature of the issues or facts to be presented and the reasons why written submissions would be insufficient to make an adequate presentation of those issues or facts to the OCC. A person requesting a hearing must simultaneously submit a copy of the request to the filer.

      (b)  The OCC may grant or deny a request for a hearing and may limit the issues to those it deems relevant or material. The OCC generally grants a hearing request only if the OCC determines that written submissions would be insufficient or that a hearing would otherwise benefit the decision-making process. The OCC also may order a hearing if it concludes that a hearing would be in the public interest.

      (c)  If the OCC denies a hearing request, it will notify the person requesting the hearing of the reason for the denial.

      (d) —(1)  The OCC issues a Notice of Hearing if it grants a request for a hearing or orders a hearing because it is in the public interest. The OCC sends a copy of the Notice of Hearing to the filer, to the person requesting the hearing, and anyone else requesting a copy. The Notice of Hearing states the subject and date of the filing, the time and place of the hearing, and the issues to be addressed. The OCC may limit the issues considered at a hearing to those it determines are relevant or material.

      (2)  The OCC appoints a presiding officer to conduct the hearing. The presiding officer is responsible for all procedural questions not governed by this section.

      (e)  Any person who wishes to appear (participant) must notify the appropriate OCC licensing office of their intent to participate in the hearing within 10 days from the date the OCC issues the Notice of Hearing. At least five days before the hearing, each participant must submit to the appropriate OCC licensing office, the filer, and any other person the OCC requires, the names of witnesses and one copy of each exhibit the participant intends to present.

      (f)  The OCC arranges for a hearing transcript. The person requesting the hearing may be required to bear the cost of one copy of the transcript for their use.

      (g) —(1)  Subject to the rulings of the presiding officer, the filer and participants may make opening statements and present witnesses, material, and data.

      (2)  A person presenting documentary material must furnish one copy to the OCC and one copy to the filer and each participant.

      (3)  The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 ), the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. appendix), the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Rule 1 ), and the OCC's Rules of Practice and Procedure (12 CFR part 19) do not apply to hearings under this section.

      (h)  At the filer's or participant's request, the OCC may keep the hearing record open for up to 14 days following the OCC's receipt of the transcript. The OCC resumes processing the filing after the record closes.

      (i) —(1)  The OCC may arrange for a public meeting in connection with a filing, either upon receipt during the comment period of a written request for such a meeting or upon the OCC's own initiative, if the OCC finds that written submissions are insufficient to address facts or issues raised in the filing or otherwise determines that a meeting will benefit the decision-making process. Public meetings will be arranged and presided over by a presiding officer.

      (2)  The OCC may arrange a meeting with a filer or other interested parties to clarify and narrow the issues and to facilitate the resolution of the issues.

      (3)  The OCC may limit the issues considered at a meeting to those it determines are relevant or material.

      (4)  The OCC may conduct a meeting in the format that it determines is appropriate, including a telephone conference, a face-to-face meeting, or a more formal meeting.

      § 5.12   Computation of time.

#### § § 5.12

      In computing the period of days, the OCC does not include the day of the act or event ( the date a filing is received by the OCC) from which the period begins to run. When the last day of a time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday.

> [80 FR 28414, May 18, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 80436, Dec. 11, 2020]

      § 5.13   Decisions.

#### § § 5.13

      (a)  The OCC may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a filing after appropriate review and consideration of the record. In reviewing a filing, the OCC may consider the activities, resources, or condition of an affiliate of the filer that may reasonably reflect on or affect the filer. It also may consider information available from any source, including any comments submitted by interested parties or views expressed by interested parties at meetings with the OCC.

      (1)  The OCC may impose conditions on any approval, including to address a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern, if the OCC determines that the conditions are necessary or appropriate to ensure that approval is consistent with relevant statutory and regulatory standards and OCC policies thereunder and safe and sound banking practices.

      (2)  The OCC grants qualifying national banks and Federal savings associations expedited review within a specified time after filing or commencement of the public comment period for certain filings.

      (i) The OCC may extend the expedited review period or remove a filing from expedited review procedures if it concludes that the filing, or an adverse comment regarding the filing, presents a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or raises a significant legal or policy issue requiring additional OCC review. The OCC will provide the filer with a written explanation if it decides not to process an application from a qualifying national bank or Federal savings association under expedited review pursuant to this paragraph.

      (ii) Adverse comments that the OCC determines do not raise a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or a significant legal or policy issue; are frivolous, non-substantive, or filed primarily as a means of delaying action on the filing; or raise a CRA concern that has been satisfactorily resolved do not affect the OCC's decision under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The OCC considers a comment to be non-substantive if it is a generalized opinion that a filing should or should not be approved or a conclusory statement, lacking factual or analytical support. The OCC considers a CRA concern to have been satisfactorily resolved if the OCC previously reviewed ( in an examination, other supervisory activity, or a prior filing made by the current filer) a concern presenting substantially the same issue in substantially the same assessment area during substantially the same time, and the OCC determines that the concern would not warrant denial or imposition of a condition on approval of the application.

      (iii) If a bank or savings association makes a filing for any activity or transaction that is dependent upon the approval of another filing under this part, or if requests for approval for more than one activity or transaction are combined in a single filing under applicable sections of this part, none of the subject filings may be deemed approved upon expiration of the applicable time periods, unless all of the filings are subject to expedited review procedures and the longest of the time periods expires without the OCC issuing a decision or notifying the bank or savings association that the filings are not eligible for expedited review under the standards in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (b)  The OCC may deny a filing if:

      (1) A significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern exists with respect to the filer;

      (2) Approval of the filing is inconsistent with applicable law, regulation, or OCC policy thereunder; or

      (3) The filer fails to provide information requested by the OCC that is necessary for the OCC to make an informed decision.

      (c)  A filing must contain information required by the applicable section set forth in this part. To the extent necessary to evaluate an application, the OCC may require a filer to provide additional information. The OCC may deem a filing abandoned if information required or requested by the OCC in connection with the filing is not furnished within the time period specified by the OCC. The OCC may return an application without a decision if it finds the filing to be materially deficient. A filing is materially deficient if it lacks sufficient information for the OCC to make a determination under the applicable statutory or regulatory criteria.

      (d)  The OCC notifies the filer, and any person who makes a written request, of the final disposition of a filing, including confirmation of an expedited review under this part. If the OCC denies a filing, the OCC notifies the filer in writing of the reasons for the denial.

      (e)  The OCC will issue a public decision when a decision represents a new or changed policy or presents issues of general interest to the public or the banking industry. In rendering its decisions, the OCC may elect not to disclose information that the OCC deems to be private or confidential.

      (f)  A filer may file an appeal of an OCC decision in writing with the Deputy Comptroller for Licensing or with the Ombudsman at the address listed on . In the event that the Deputy Comptroller for Licensing was the deciding official of the matter appealed, or was involved personally and substantially in the matter, the appeal may be referred instead to the Chief Counsel or the Ombudsman.

      (g)  When the OCC approves or conditionally approves a filing, the OCC generally gives the filer a specified period of time to commence that new or expanded activity. The OCC does not generally grant an extension of the time specified to commence a new or expanded corporate activity approved under this part, unless the OCC determines that the delay is beyond the filer's control.

      (h)  The OCC may nullify any decision on a filing either prior to or after consummation of the transaction if:

      (1) The OCC discovers a material misrepresentation or omission in any information provided to the OCC in the filing or supporting materials;

      (2) The decision is contrary to law, regulation, or OCC policy thereunder; or

      (3) The decision was granted due to clerical or administrative error, or a material mistake of law or fact.

      (i)  The OCC may modify, suspend, or rescind a decision on a filing if a material change in the information or circumstance on which the OCC relied occurs prior to the date of the consummation of the transaction to which the decision pertains.

      (c)  This section describes the procedures and requirements governing OCC review and approval of an application to establish a national bank or a Federal stock or mutual savings association, including a national bank or a Federal savings association with a special purpose. Information regarding an application to establish an interim national bank or an interim Federal savings association solely to facilitate a business combination is set forth in § 5.33. This section also describes the requirements for an existing national bank or Federal savings association to change the purpose of its charter and refers such institutions to § 5.53 for the procedures to follow.

      (d)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means a bank owned exclusively (except to the extent directors' qualifying shares are required by law) by other depository institutions or depository institution holding companies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813), the activities of which are limited by its articles of association exclusively to providing services to or for other depository institutions, their holding companies, and the officers, directors, and employees of such institutions and companies, and to providing correspondent banking services at the request of other depository institutions or their holding companies.

      (2)  means with respect to an application to establish a national bank, control as used in section 2(a)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2), and with respect to an application to establish a Federal savings association, control as used in section 10(a)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(a)(2).

      (3)  means the OCC action issuing a charter and authorizing a national bank or Federal savings association to open for business.

      (4)  means any company that controls or proposes to control a national bank or a Federal savings association whether or not the company is a bank holding company under section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(1), or a savings and loan holding company under section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a.

      (5)  means the largest depository institution controlled by a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company based on a comparison of the average total assets controlled by each depository institution as reported in its Consolidated Report of Condition and Income required to be filed for the immediately preceding four calendar quarters.

      (6)  means either a national bank or Federal savings association.

      (7)  means a member of the organizing group.

      (8)  means five or more natural persons acting on their own behalf, or serving as representatives of a sponsoring holding company, who apply to the OCC for a national bank or Federal savings association charter.

      (9)  means a decision by the OCC permitting an organizing group to go forward with the organization of the proposed national bank or Federal savings association. A preliminary approval generally is subject to certain conditions that a filer must satisfy before the OCC will grant final approval.

      (10)  means a person who directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies, or together with members of their immediate family, will own, control, or hold 10 percent or more of the voting stock of the proposed national bank or Federal savings association.

      (e) —(1)  (i) The OCC charters a national bank under the authority of the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1  The bank may be a special purpose bank that limits its activities to fiduciary activities or to any other activities within the business of banking. A special purpose bank that conducts activities other than fiduciary activities must conduct at least one of the following three core banking functions: Receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money. The name of a proposed national bank must include the word “national.”

      (ii) The OCC charters a Federal savings association under the authority of section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464, which in an application to establish a Federal savings association requires the OCC to consider:

      (A) Whether the filers are persons of good character and responsibility;

      (B) Whether a necessity exists for the association in the community to be served;

      (C) Whether there is a reasonable probability of the association's usefulness and success; and

      (D) Whether the association can be established without undue injury to properly conducted existing local savings associations and home financing institutions.

      (iii) In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC verifies that the proposed national bank or Federal savings association has complied with the following requirements. A national bank or a Federal savings association must:

      (A) File either articles of association (for a national bank), or a charter and by-laws (for a Federal savings association) with the OCC;

      (B) In the case of an application to establish a national bank, file an organization certificate containing specified information with the OCC;

      (C) Ensure that all capital stock is paid in, or in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, ensure that at least a minimum amount of capital is paid in; and

      (D) Have at least five elected directors.

      (2)  Twelve CFR part 25 requires the OCC to take into account a proposed insured national bank's or Federal savings association's description of how it will meet its CRA objectives.

      (3)  Preliminary approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will be conditioned on the savings association applying for and receiving approval for deposit insurance from the FDIC. Final approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will not be issued until receipt by the OCC of written confirmation by the FDIC that the accounts of the Federal savings association will be insured by the FDIC.

      (f) —(1)  In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC is guided by the following principles:

      (i) Maintaining a safe and sound banking system;

      (ii) Encouraging a national bank or Federal savings association to provide fair access to financial services by helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community;

      (iii) Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; and

      (iv) Promoting fair treatment of customers including efficiency and better service.

      (2)  (i) In evaluating an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed institution:

      (A) Has organizers who are familiar with national banking laws and regulations or Federal savings association laws and regulations, respectively;

      (B) Has competent management, including a board of directors, with ability and experience relevant to the types of services to be provided;

      (C) Has capital that is sufficient to support the projected volume and type of business;

      (D) Can reasonably be expected to achieve and maintain profitability;

      (E) Will be operated in a safe and sound manner; and

      (F) Does not have a title that misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it offers.

      (ii) In evaluating an application to establish a Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed Federal savings association will be operated as a qualified thrift lender under section 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m).

      (iii) The OCC may also consider additional factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1816, including the risk to the Federal deposit insurance fund, and whether the proposed institution's corporate powers are consistent with the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Bank Act, and the Home Owners' Loan Act, as applicable.

      (3)  The OCC evaluates a proposed institution's organizing group and its business plan or operating plan together. The OCC's judgment concerning one may affect the evaluation of the other. An organizing group and its business plan or operating plan must be stronger in markets where economic conditions are marginal or competition is intense.

      (g) —(1)  Strong organizing groups generally include diverse business and financial interests and community involvement. An organizing group must have the experience, competence, willingness, and ability to be active in directing the proposed institution's affairs in a safe and sound manner. The institution's initial board of directors generally is comprised of many, if not all, of the organizers. The business plan or operating plan and other information supplied in the application must demonstrate an organizing group's collective ability to establish and operate a successful national bank or Federal savings association in the economic and competitive conditions of the market to be served. Each organizer should be knowledgeable about the business plan or operating plan. A poor business plan or operating plan reflects adversely on the organizing group's ability, and the OCC generally denies applications with poor business plans or operating plans.

      (2)  The initial board of directors must select competent senior executive officers before the OCC grants final approval. Early selection of executive officers, especially the chief executive officer, contributes favorably to the preparation and review of a business plan or operating plan that is accurate, complete, and appropriate for the type of national bank or Federal savings association proposed and its market, and reflects favorably upon an application. As a condition of the charter approval, the OCC retains the right to object to and preclude the hiring of any officer, or the appointment or election of any director, for a two-year period from the date the institution commences business, or longer as appropriate.

      (3)  (i) Each organizer must have a history of responsibility, personal honesty, and integrity. Personal wealth is not a prerequisite to become an organizer or director of a national bank or Federal savings association. However, directors' stock purchases, or, in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, capital contributions, individually and in the aggregate, should reflect a financial commitment to the success of the institution that is reasonable in relation to their individual and collective financial strength. A director should not have to depend on institution dividends, fees, or other compensation to satisfy financial obligations.

      (ii) Because directors are often the primary source of additional capital for an institution not affiliated with a holding company, it is desirable that the proposed directors of the national bank or Federal savings association, as a group, be able to supply or have a realistic plan to enable the institution to obtain capital when needed.

      (iii) Any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, between the organizing group or other insiders and the proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be on nonpreferential terms.

      (4)  (i) Organizers are expected to contribute time and expertise to the organization of the national bank or Federal savings association. Organizers should not bill excessive charges to the institution for professional and consulting services or unduly rely upon these fees as a source of income.

      (ii) A proposed national bank or Federal savings association may not pay any fee that is contingent upon an OCC decision. Such action generally is grounds for denial of the application or nullification or rescission of a preliminary approval. Organizational expenses for denied applications are the sole responsibility of the organizing group.

      (5)  A sponsor must be financially able to support the new institution's operations and to provide or locate capital when needed. The OCC primarily considers the financial and managerial resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's record of performance, rather than the financial and managerial resources of the organizing group, if an organizing group is sponsored by:

      (i) An existing holding company;

      (ii) Individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions; or

      (iii) Individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.

      (h) —(1)  (i) Organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must submit a business plan or operating plan that adequately addresses the statutory and policy considerations set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f)(2) of this section. In the case of a proposed Federal savings association the plan must also specifically address meeting qualified thrift lender requirements. The plan must reflect sound banking principles and demonstrate realistic assessments of risk in light of economic and competitive conditions in the market to be served.

      (ii) The OCC may offset deficiencies in one factor by strengths in one or more other factors. However, deficiencies in some factors, such as unrealistic earnings prospects, may have a negative influence on the evaluation of other factors, such as capital adequacy, or may be serious enough by themselves to result in denial. The OCC considers inadequacies in a business plan or operating plan to reflect negatively on the organizing group's ability to operate a successful institution.

      (2)  The organizing group must submit  balance sheets and income statements as part of the business plan or operating plan. The OCC reviews all projections for reasonableness of assumptions and consistency with the business plan or operating plan.

      (3)  (i) The organizing group must include in the business plan or operating plan information sufficient to permit the OCC to evaluate the overall management ability of the organizing group. If the organizing group has limited banking experience or community involvement, the senior executive officers must be able to compensate for such deficiencies.

      (ii) The organizing group may not hire an officer or elect or appoint a director if the OCC objects to that person at any time prior to the date the institution commences business.

      (4)  A proposed bank or Federal savings association must have sufficient initial capital, net of any organizational expenses that will be charged to the institution's capital after it begins operations, to support the institution's projected volume and type of business.

      (5)  (i) The business plan or operating plan must indicate the organizing group's knowledge of and plans for serving the community. The organizing group must evaluate the banking needs of the community, including its consumer, business, nonprofit, and government sectors. The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate how the proposed national bank or Federal savings association responds to those needs consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. The provisions of this paragraph may not apply to an application to organize an institution for a special purpose.

      (ii) As part of its business plan or operating plan, the organizing group must submit a statement that demonstrates its plans to achieve CRA objectives.

      (iii) Because community support is important to the long-term success of a national bank or Federal savings association, the organizing group must include plans for attracting and maintaining community support.

      (6)  The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate that the organizing group (and the sponsoring company, if any), is aware of, and understands, applicable depository institution laws and regulations, and safe and sound banking operations and practices. The OCC will deny an application that does not meet these safety and soundness requirements.

      (7)  The business plan or operating plan must indicate if the proposed institution intends to exercise fiduciary powers. The information required by § 5.26 must be filed with the charter application. A separate application is not required.

      (i) —(1)  The OCC normally requires a prefiling meeting with the organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association before the organizers file an application. Organizers should be familiar with the OCC's chartering policy and procedural requirements in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual before the prefiling meeting. The prefiling meeting normally is held in the district office where the application will be filed but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.

      (2)  An organizing group must file a business plan or operating plan that addresses the subjects discussed in paragraph (h) of this section.

      (3) . (i) Each proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder must submit to the appropriate OCC licensing office:

      (A) The information prescribed in the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at  and

      (B) Legible fingerprints.

      (ii) The OCC may require additional information about any proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder, if appropriate. The OCC may waive any of the information requirements of this paragraph if the OCC determines that it is in the public interest.

      (4)  The organizing group must designate a contact person to represent the organizing group in all contacts with the OCC. The contact person must be an organizer and proposed director of the new national bank or Federal savings association, except a representative of the sponsor or sponsors may serve as contact person if an application is sponsored by an existing holding company, individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions, or individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.

      (5)  The OCC notifies the contact person and other relevant parties in writing of its decision on an application.

      (6)  (i) Before the OCC grants final approval, a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be established as a legal entity. A national bank becomes a legal entity after it has filed its organization certificate and articles of association with the OCC as required by law. A Federal savings association becomes a legal entity after it has filed its proposed charter and bylaws with the OCC. A proposed national bank may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed national bank's charter application, provided that the proposed national bank has filed articles of association, an organization certificate, and a completed charter application and the bank complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section. A proposed Federal stock savings association may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed Federal stock savings association's charter application, provided that the proposed Federal stock savings association has filed a proposed charter, bylaws, and a completed charter application and the Federal stock savings association complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section.

      (ii)(A) After the OCC grants preliminary approval, the organizing group must elect a board of directors, take steps necessary to organize the proposed national bank or Federal savings association and prepare it for commencing business.

      (B) A proposed national bank may not conduct the business of banking until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter. A proposed Federal savings association may not commence business until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter, which must be in the form provided in this part.

      (iii) For all capital obtained through a public offering a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must use an offering circular that complies with the OCC's securities offering regulations, 12 CFR part 16, as applicable. All securities of a particular class in the initial offering must be sold at the same price.

      (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association in organization must raise its capital before it commences business. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank or Federal savings association does not raise the required capital within 12 months from the date the OCC grants preliminary approval. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank or Federal savings association does not commence business within 18 months from the date of preliminary approval, unless the OCC grants an extension. If preliminary approval expires, all cash collected on subscriptions must be returned.

      (j)  An application to establish a full-service national bank or Federal savings association that is sponsored by a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company whose lead depository institution is an eligible bank or eligible savings association is deemed preliminarily approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the public comment period or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, whichever is later, unless the OCC:

      (1) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2); or

      (2) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the OCC has determined that the proposed bank will offer banking services that are materially different than those offered by the lead depository institution.

      (k) —(1)  In addition to the other requirements of this section, when an organizing group seeks to organize a national bankers' bank, the organizing group must list in the application the anticipated activities and customers or clients of the proposed national bankers' bank.

      (2)  At the organizing group's request, the OCC may waive requirements that are applicable to national banks in general if those requirements are inappropriate for a national bankers' bank and would impede its ability to provide desired services to its market. A filer must submit a request for a waiver with the application and must support the request with adequate justification and legal analysis. A national bankers' bank that is already in operation may also request a waiver. The OCC cannot waive statutory provisions that specifically apply to national bankers' banks pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 27(b)(1).

      (3)  A national bank or Federal savings association may invest up to 10 percent of its capital and surplus in a bankers' bank and may own five percent or less of any class of a bankers' bank's voting securities.

      (l) —(1)  A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will limit its activities to fiduciary activities, credit card operations, or another special purpose must adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will have a community development focus must also adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A national bank that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with applicable requirements of 12 CFR part 24. A Federal savings association that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with § 160.36 or any other applicable requirements.

      (2)  An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are limited to a special purpose that desires to change to another special purpose, to add another special purpose, or to no longer be limited to a special purpose charter must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53. An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are not limited that desires to limit its activities and become a special purpose institution must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53.

      § 5.21   Federal mutual savings association charter and bylaws.

#### § § 5.21

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, and 2901

      (b)  A Federal mutual savings association must file an application, notice, or other filing as prescribed by this section when adopting or amending its charter or bylaws.

      (c)  This section describes the procedures and requirements governing charters and bylaws for Federal mutual savings associations.

      (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, §§ 5.8 through 5.11 do not apply to this section.

      (e)  Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a Federal mutual savings association must have a charter in the following form. A charter for a Federal mutual savings bank must substitute the term “savings bank” for “association.” The term “trustee” may be substituted for the term “director.” Associations adopting this charter with existing borrower members must grandfather those borrower members who were members as of the date of issuance of the new charter by the OCC. Such borrowers will have one vote for the period of time such borrowings are in existence.

      (f)  In order to adopt a charter amendment, a Federal mutual savings association must comply with the following requirements:

      (1)  The board of directors of the association must adopt a resolution proposing the charter amendment that states the text of such amendment;

      (2) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a Federal mutual savings association must file the proposed charter amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of, the OCC.

      (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the charter amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the amendment is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section and is not eligible for expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendment.

      (B)  Expedited review is not available for a charter amendment that would render more difficult or discourage a merger, proxy contest, the assumption of control by a mutual account holder of the association, or the removal of incumbent management; or involve a significant issue of law or policy.

      (ii)  No application under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is required if the text of the amendment is contained within paragraphs (e) or (g) of this section. In such case, the Federal mutual savings association must submit a notice with the charter amendment to the OCC within 30 days after adoption.

      (3)  A charter amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and adoption by the association, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendment.

      (g)  The following charter amendments are subject to the notice requirement in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section if adopted without change:

      (1)  Add a second paragraph to section 4, as follows:

      (2)  A Federal mutual savings association that complies with § 5.42 may amend its charter by substituting a new corporate title in section 1.

      (3)  A Federal mutual savings association may amend its charter by substituting a new home office in section 2, if it has complied with applicable requirements of § 5.40.

      (4)  A Federal mutual savings association may amend its charter by substituting any number of votes per member between 1 and 1000 in section 6.

      (h)  A Federal mutual savings association that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the OCC. Such request for reissuance should be filed at the appropriate OCC licensing office and contain signatures required under paragraph (e) of this section, together with such supporting documents as may be needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.

      (i)  A Federal mutual savings association must make available a true copy of its charter and bylaws and all amendments thereto to accountholders at all times in each office of the savings association, and must upon request deliver to any accountholders a copy of such charter and bylaws or amendments thereto.

      (j) —(1)  A Federal mutual savings association must operate under bylaws that contain provisions that comply with all requirements specified by the OCC in this paragraph and that are not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph; the association's charter; and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations  a bylaw provision inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph may be adopted with the approval of the OCC. Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the votes cast by the members at a legal meeting or a majority of the association's board of directors. The bylaws for a Federal mutual savings bank must substitute the term “savings bank” for “association”. The term “trustee” may be substituted for the term “director”.

      (2)  The following requirements are applicable to Federal mutual savings associations:

      (i)  (A) An association must provide for and conduct an annual meeting of its members for the election of directors and at which any other business of the association may be conducted. Such meeting must be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate, and at a date and time within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. The association's bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation of members at an annual meeting. Members participating in an annual meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section.

      (B) At each annual meeting, the officers must make a full report of the financial condition of the association and of its progress for the preceding year and must outline a program for the succeeding year.

      (C) If the association's bylaws provide for telephonic or electronic participation in member meetings, the association must follow the procedures for telephonic or electronic participation of the State corporate governance provisions it is permitted to elect pursuant to paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, if those State corporate governance provisions include telephonic or electronic participation procedures; the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter) (with “member” substituting for “stockholder”); or the Model Business Corporation Act (with “member” substituting for “shareholder”), provided, however, that such procedures are not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness. The association must indicate the use of these procedures in its bylaws.

      (ii)  Procedures for calling any special meeting of the members and for conducting such a meeting must be set forth in the bylaws. The board of directors of the association or the holders of 10 percent or more of the voting capital must be entitled to call a special meeting. The association's bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation of members at a special meeting pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(C) of this section. Members participating in a special meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, “voting capital” means FDIC-insured deposits as of the voting record date.

      (iii)  Notice specifying the date, time, and place of the annual or any special meeting and adequately describing any business to be conducted must be published for two successive weeks immediately prior to the week in which such meeting will convene in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or county in which the principal place of business of the association is located, or mailed postage prepaid at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the date on which such meeting will convene to each of its members of record. A similar notice must be posted in a conspicuous place in each of the offices of the association during the 14 days immediately preceding the date on which such meeting will convene. The bylaws may permit a member to waive in writing any right to receive personal delivery of the notice. When any meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjournment and reconvening of the meeting must be given as in the case of the original meeting.

      (iv)  The bylaws must provide for the fixing of a record date and a method for determining from the books of the association the members entitled to vote. Such date may not be more than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. The same determination must apply to any adjourned meeting.

      (v)  Any number of members present and voting, represented in person or by proxy, at a regular or special meeting of the members constitutes a quorum. A majority of all votes cast at any meeting of the members determines any question, unless otherwise required by regulation. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Members present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment.

      (vi)  Procedures must be established for voting at any annual or special meeting of the members by proxy pursuant to the rules and regulations of the OCC. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the member. All proxies with a term greater than eleven months or solicited at the expense of the association must run to the board of directors as a whole, or to a committee appointed by a majority of such board.

      (vii)  Provisions relating to communications between members must be consistent with § 144.8 of this chapter. No member, however, may have the right to inspect or copy any portion of any books or records of a Federal mutual savings association containing:

      (A) A list of depositors in or borrowers from such association;

      (B) Their addresses;

      (C) Individual deposit or loan balances or records; or

      (D) Any data from which such information could be reasonably constructed.

      (viii)  The bylaws must set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OTS prior to July 21, 2011 or by the OCC. Each director of the association must be a member of the association. Directors may be elected for periods of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified, but if a staggered board is chosen, provision must be made for the election of approximately one-third or one-half of the board each year, as appropriate. State-chartered savings banks converting to Federal savings banks may include alternative provisions for the election and term of office of directors so long as such provisions are authorized by the OCC, and provide for compliance with the standard provisions of this paragraph no later than six years after the conversion to a Federal savings association.

      (ix)  The board of directors determines the place, frequency, time, procedure for notice, which must be at least 24 hours unless waived by the directors, and waiver of notice for all regular and special meetings. The board also may permit telephonic or electronic participation at meetings. The bylaws may provide for action to be taken without a meeting if unanimous written consent is obtained for such action. A majority of the authorized directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of the board.

      (x)  (A) The bylaws must contain provisions regarding the officers of the association, their functions, duties, and powers. The officers of the association must consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom must be elected annually by the board of directors. Such other officers and assistant officers and agents as may be deemed necessary may be elected or appointed by the board of directors or chosen in such other manner as may be prescribed in the bylaws. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person, except the offices of president and secretary.

      (B) Any officer may be removed by the board of directors with or without cause, but such removal, other than for cause, must be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. Termination for cause, for purposes of this section and § 5.22, includes termination because of the person's personal dishonesty; incompetence; willful misconduct; breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit; intentional failure to perform stated duties; willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order; or material breach of any provision of an employment contract.

      (xi)  In the event of a vacancy on the board, the board of directors may, by its affirmative vote, fill such vacancy, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy may serve only until the next election of directors by the members. The bylaws must set out the procedure for the resignation of a director. Directors may be removed only for cause, as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(x)(B) of this section, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

      (xii)  The board of directors has the power to exercise any and all of the powers of the association not expressly reserved by the charter to the members.

      (xiii)  The bylaws must provide that nominations for directors may be made at the annual meeting by any member and must be voted upon, except, however, the bylaws may require that nominations by a member must be submitted to the secretary and then prominently posted in the principal place of business at least 10 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. However, if such provision is made for prior submission of nominations by a member, then the bylaws must provide for a nominating committee, which, except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity, must submit nominations to the secretary and have such nominations similarly posted at least 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.

      (xiv)  The bylaws must provide procedures for the introduction of new business at the annual meeting.

      (xv)  Bylaws may include any provision for their amendment that would be consistent with applicable law, rules, and regulations and adequately addresses its subject and purpose.

      (A) Amendments will be effective:

      () After approval by a majority vote of the authorized board, or by a majority of the vote cast by the members of the association at a legal meeting; and

      () After receipt of any applicable regulatory approval.

      (B) When an association fails to meet its quorum requirement, solely due to vacancies on the board, the bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of a majority of the sitting board.

      (xvi)  The bylaws also may address any other subjects necessary or appropriate for effective operation of the association.

      (3) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(3)(ii) or (j)(3)(iii) of this section, a Federal mutual savings association must file the proposed bylaw amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of, the OCC.

      (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section, the bylaw amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the bylaw amendment is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section and is not eligible for expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

      (B)  A bylaw amendment is not subject to expedited review if it would render more difficult or discourage a merger, proxy contest, the assumption of control by a mutual account holder of the association, or the removal of incumbent management; involve a significant issue of law or policy, including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or officer liability; or be inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph or with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or the association's charter.

      (ii)  A Federal mutual association may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of the laws of any State in which the home office or any branch of the association is located, provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and safety and soundness, and such provisions are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal mutual association must designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body of law selected for its corporate governance provisions, and must submit a notice containing a copy of such bylaws, within 30 days after adoption. The notice must indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section.

      (iii)  No filing is required for purposes of paragraph (j)(3) of this section if a bylaw amendment adopts the language of the OCC's model or optional bylaws without change.

      (4)  A bylaw amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

      (5)  Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal mutual savings association to engage in any transaction is determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect.

      § 5.22   Federal stock savings association charter and bylaws.

#### § § 5.22

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, and 2901

      (b)  A Federal stock savings association must file an application, notice, or other filing as prescribed by this section when adopting or amending its charter or bylaws.

      (c)  This section describes the procedures and requirements governing charters and bylaws for Federal stock savings associations.

      (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, §§ 5.8 through 5.11 do not apply to this section.

      (e)  The charter of a Federal stock association must be in the following form, except as provided in this section. An association that has converted from the mutual form pursuant to part 192 of this chapter must include in its charter a section establishing a liquidation account as required by § 192.485 of this chapter. A charter for a Federal stock savings bank must substitute the term “savings bank” for “association.” Charters may also include any preapproved optional provision contained in this section.

      (f)  In order to adopt a charter amendment, a Federal stock savings association must comply with the following requirements:

      (1)  The board of directors of the association must adopt a resolution proposing the charter amendment that states the text of such amendment;

      (2) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a Federal stock savings association must file the proposed charter amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of the OCC.

      (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the charter amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the amendment is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section and is not subject to expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendment.

      (B)  Expedited review is not available for a charter amendment that would render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a block of the association's stock, the removal of incumbent management, or involve a significant issue of law or policy.

      (ii)  No application under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is required if the amendment is contained within paragraphs (e) or (g) of this section. In such case, the Federal stock savings association must submit a notice with the charter amendment to the OCC within 30 days after adoption.

      (3)  A charter amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendments.

      (g)  The following charter amendments are subject to the notice requirement in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section if adopted without change:

      (1)  A Federal stock association that complies with § 5.42 of this chapter may amend its charter by substituting a new corporate title in section 1.

      (2)  A Federal savings association may amend its charter by substituting a new home office in section 2, if it has complied with applicable requirements of § 5.40.

      (3)  A Federal stock association may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.

      (4)  A Federal stock association may amend its charter by revising Section 5 to read as follows:

      (5)  A Federal stock association may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the issuance or reservation of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances which would require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange if the shares were then listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

      (6)  A Federal stock association may amend its charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence in the third paragraph of Section 5: “Each holder of shares of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder and there will be no right to cumulate votes in an election of directors.”

      (7)  Notwithstanding the law of the State in which the association is located, a Federal stock association may amend its charter by renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section 8 as follows:

      (h)  The OCC may grant approval to a charter amendment not listed in paragraph (g) of this section regarding the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities provided that the association files as part of its application pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section an opinion, acceptable to the OCC, of counsel independent from the association that the proposed charter provision would be permitted to be adopted by a corporation chartered by the State in which the principal office of the association is located. Any such provision must be consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and OCC policies. Further, any such provision that would have the effect of rendering more difficult a change in control of the association and would require for any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required by this part, may not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be required to take any action under such provision.

      (i)  A Federal stock association that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the OCC. Such requests for reissuance should be filed with the appropriate OCC licensing office, and contain signatures required in the form “Federal Stock Charter” in paragraph (e) of this section, together with such supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.

      (j) —(1)  Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by either a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders at a legal meeting or a majority of the board of directors. A bylaw provision inconsistent with paragraph (k), (l), (m) or (n) of this section may be adopted only with the approval of the OCC.

      (2) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) or (j)(2)(iii) of this section, a Federal stock savings association must file the proposed bylaw amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of, the OCC.

      (A)  Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the bylaw amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the application is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section and is not eligible for expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

      (B)  Expedited review is not available for a bylaw amendment that would:

      () Render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the association's stock, or the removal of incumbent management; or

      () Be inconsistent with paragraphs (k) through (n) of this section, with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the association's charter or involve a significant issue of law or policy, including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or officer liability.

      (ii)  A Federal stock association may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of: The laws of any State in which the home office or any branch of the association is located; the laws of any State in which a holding company of the association is incorporated or chartered; Delaware General Corporation law; or the Model Business Corporation Act, provided that such provisions may be elected to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness, and such provisions are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal stock association must designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body or bodies of law selected for its corporate governance provisions, and must file a notice containing a copy of such bylaws, within 30 days after adoption. The notice must indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. A Federal stock savings association that has elected to follow the corporate governance provisions of the law of the State in which its holding company is incorporated may continue to use those provisions even if the association is no longer controlled by that holding company.

      (iii)  No filing is required for purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section if a bylaw amendment adopts the language of the OCC's model or optional bylaws without change.

      (3)  A bylaw amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

      (4)  Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal savings association to engage in any transaction is determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect.

      (k) —(1) —(i)  A meeting of the shareholders of the association for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the association must be held annually within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or by such other persons as may be specified in the bylaws of the association.

      (ii) —(A)  All annual and special meetings of shareholders of the association may be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate. The association's bylaws may provide for the telephonic or electronic participation of shareholders in these meetings. Shareholders participating in an annual or special meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.

      (B)  If the association's bylaws provide for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings, the association must elect to follow corporate governance provisions for these meetings pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section that include procedures for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings. The association must indicate the use of these elected procedures in its bylaws.

      (2)  Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called must be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chair of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice will be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date prescribed in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the shareholder notice requirement.

      (3)  For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors must fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case may not be more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination will apply to any adjournment thereof.

      (4)  (i) At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for the shares of the association must make a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders must be kept on file at the home office of the association and is subject to inspection by any shareholder of record or the stockholder's agent during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book will constitute  evidence of the stockholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the voting list requirements.

      (ii) In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section, the board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is entitled to vote on such matter and who must defray the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the association in performance of the act or acts required.

      (5)  A majority of the outstanding shares of the association entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders voting together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter. Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election of directors.

      (6) —(i)  Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, at all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management must be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy maybe valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.

      (ii)  Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the association nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the association, may be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.

      (7)  Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders must be voted upon at the annual meeting if such nominations or new business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the association at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Ballots bearing the names of all the persons nominated must be provided for use at the annual meeting.

      (8)  If the bylaws of the association so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.

      (l) —(1)  The business and affairs of the association must be under the direction of its board of directors. Directors need not be stockholders unless the bylaws so require.

      (2)  The bylaws must set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OTS prior to July 21, 2011 or the OCC. Directors must be elected for a term of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. If a staggered board is chosen, the directors must be divided into two or three classes as nearly equal in number as possible and one class must be elected by ballot annually.

      (3)  The board of directors determines the place, frequency, time and procedure for notice of regular meetings. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at these meetings.

      (4)  A majority of the number of directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the OCC.

      (5)  Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even with less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy may serve only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.

      (6)  (i) At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be removed only for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Associations may provide for procedures regarding resignations in the bylaws.

      (ii) If less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal would be sufficient to elect a director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part.

      (iii) Whenever the holders of the shares of any class are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the charter or supplemental sections thereto, the provisions of this section apply, in respect to the removal of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

      (7)  The board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full board, may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees. No committee may have the authority of the board of directors with reference to: The declaration of dividends; the amendment of the charter or bylaws of the association; recommending to the stockholders a plan of merger, consolidation, or conversion; the sale, lease, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of the association otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; a voluntary dissolution of the association; a revocation of any of the foregoing; or the approval of a transaction in which any member of the executive committee, directly or indirectly, has any material beneficial interest. The designation of any committee and the delegation of authority thereto does not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any director, of any responsibility imposed by law or regulation.

      (8)  Written notice of at least 24 hours regarding any special meeting of the board of directors or of any committee designated thereby must be given to each director in accordance with the bylaws, although such notice may be waived by the director. The attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at a special meeting.

      (9)  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by all of the directors.

      (10)  A director of the association who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any association matter is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless their dissent or abstention is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless a written dissent to such action is filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or is forwarded by registered mail to the secretary of the association within five days after the date on which a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent does not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

      (11)  A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for directors. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules and regulations.

      (m) —(1)  The officers of the association must consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom must be elected by the board of directors. The board of directors may also designate the chair of the board as an officer. The offices of the secretary and treasurer or comptroller may be held by the same person and the vice president may also be either the secretary or the treasurer or comptroller. The board of directors may designate one or more vice presidents as executive vice president or senior vice president.

      (2)  Any officer may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the association will be served thereby; but such removal, other than for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), will be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed.

      (3)  A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for officers. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules, and regulations.

      (n) —(1)  Certificates representing shares of capital stock of the association must be in such form as determined by the board of directors and approved by the OCC. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, must be entered on the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates surrendered to the association for transfer must be cancelled and no new certificate may be issued until the former certificate for a like number of shares has been surrendered and cancelled, except that in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of directors may prescribe.

      (2)  Transfer of shares of capital stock of the association may be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority for such transfer may be given only by the holder of record or by a legal representative, who must furnish proper evidence of such authority, or by an attorney authorized by a duly executed power of attorney and filed with the association. The transfer may be made only on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the association is deemed by the association to be the owner for all purposes.

      § 5.23   Conversion to become a Federal savings association.

#### § § 5.23

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 35, 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1467a, 2903, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  (1) This section describes procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a mutual depository institution to convert to a Federal mutual savings association or an application by a stock depository institution to convert to a Federal stock savings association.

      (2) As used in this section, depository institution means any commercial bank (including a private bank), a savings bank, a trust company, a savings and loan association, a building and loan association, a homestead association, a cooperative bank, an industrial bank, or a credit union chartered in the United States and having its principal office located in the United States.

      (c)  A depository institution that is mutual in form (“mutual depository institution”) must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a Federal mutual savings association. A stock depository institution must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a Federal stock savings association. At the time of conversion, the filer must have deposits insured by the FDIC. An institution that is not already insured by the FDIC must apply to the FDIC, and obtain FDIC approval, for deposit insurance before converting.

      (d) —(1)  Consistent with the OCC's chartering policy, it is OCC policy to allow conversion to a Federal savings association charter by another financial institution that can operate safely and soundly as a Federal savings association in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. This includes consideration of the factors set out in section 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(e). The converting financial institution must obtain all necessary regulatory and shareholder or member approvals. The OCC may deny an application by any mutual depository institution or stock depository institution to convert to a Federal mutual savings association charter or Federal stock association charter, respectively, on the basis of the standards for denial set forth in § 5.13(b) or when conversion would permit the filer to escape supervisory action by its current regulators.

      (2) —(i)  The filer should consult with the appropriate OCC licensing office prior to filing if it anticipates that its application will raise unusual or complex issues. If a prefiling meeting is appropriate, it will normally be held in the OCC licensing office where the application will be filed, but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.

      (ii)  A mutual depository institution or a stock depository institution must submit its application to convert to a Federal mutual savings association or Federal stock depository association, respectively, to the appropriate OCC licensing office and must send a copy of the application to its current appropriate Federal banking agency. The application must:

      (A) Identify each branch that the resulting financial institution expects to operate after conversion;

      (B) Include the institution's most recent audited financial statements (if any);

      (C) Include the latest report of condition and report of income (the most recent daily statement of condition will suffice if the institution does not file these reports);

      (D) Unless otherwise advised by the OCC in a prefiling communication, include an opinion of counsel that, in the case of State-chartered institutions, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable State law, or in the case of Federally-chartered institutions, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable Federal law;

      (E) State whether the institution wishes to exercise fiduciary powers after the conversion;

      (F) Identify all subsidiaries, service corporation investments, bank service company investments, and other equity investments that will be retained following the conversion, and provide the information and analysis of the subsidiaries' activities and the service corporation investments and other equity investments that would be required if the converting mutual institution or stock institution were a Federal mutual savings association or Federal stock savings association, respectively, establishing each subsidiary or making each service corporation or other equity investment pursuant to § 5.35, § 5.38, § 5.58, or § 5.59, or other applicable law and regulation;

      (G) Identify any nonconforming assets (including nonconforming subsidiaries) and nonconforming activities that the institution engages in and describe the plans to retain or divest those assets and activities;

      (H) Include a business plan if the converting institution has been operating for less than three years, plans to make significant changes to its business after the conversion, or at the request of the OCC;

      (I) Include a list of all outstanding conditions or other requirements imposed by the institution's current appropriate Federal banking agency and, if applicable, current State bank supervisor or State attorney-general in any cease and desist order, written agreement, other formal enforcement order, memorandum of understanding, approval of any application, notice or request, commitment letter, board resolution, or in any other manner, including the converting institution's analysis whether any such actions prohibit conversion under 12 U.S.C. 35, and the converting institution's plans regarding adhering to such conditions and requirements after conversion;

      (J) If the converting institution does not meet the qualified thrift lender test of 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m), include a plan to achieve compliance within a reasonable period of time and a request for an exception from the OCC;

      (K) Include a list of directors and senior executive officers, as defined in § 5.51, of the converting institution; and

      (L) Include a list of individuals, directors, and shareholders who directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies, or together with members of their immediate family, do or will own, control, or hold 10 percent or more of the institution's voting stock.

      (iii) The OCC may permit a Federal savings association to retain nonconforming assets of a converting institution for the time period prescribed by the OCC following a conversion, subject to conditions and an OCC determination of the carrying value of the retained assets consistent with the requirements of section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)) relating to loans and investments. The OCC may permit a Federal savings association to continue nonconforming activities of a converting institution for the time period prescribed by the OCC following a conversion, subject to conditions.

      (iv) The OCC may require directors and senior executive officers of the converting institution to submit the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at  and legible fingerprints.

      (v) Approval for an institution to convert to a Federal savings association expires if the conversion has not occurred within six months of the OCC's approval of the application, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

      (vi) When the OCC determines that the filer has satisfied all statutory and regulatory requirements and any other conditions, the OCC issues a charter. The charter provides that the institution is authorized to begin conducting business as a Federal mutual savings association or a Federal stock savings association as of a specified date.

      (3)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (4)  An application by an eligible bank to convert to a Federal savings association charter is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

      (e)  In addition to the rules and procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, a filer converting from a mutual depository institution to a Federal mutual savings association must comply with the following: After a Federal charter is issued to a converting institution, the association's members must after due notice, or upon a valid adjournment of a previous legal meeting, hold a meeting to elect directors and take care of all other actions necessary to fully effectuate the conversion and operate the association in accordance with law and these rules and regulations. Immediately thereafter, the board of directors must meet, elect officers, and transact any other appropriate business.

      (f) —(1)  A national bank may convert to a Federal stock savings association. In addition to the rules and procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, a national bank that desires to convert to a Federal stock savings association must follow the requirements and procedures set forth in 12 U.S.C. 214a as if it were converting to a State bank and include in its application information demonstrating compliance with the applicable requirements of 12 U.S.C. 214a.

      (2)  The appropriate OCC licensing office provides instructions to the converting national bank for terminating its status as a national bank and beginning its status as a Federal savings association.

      (g)  The existence of the converting institution continues in the resulting Federal savings association. The resulting Federal savings association is considered the same business and entity as the converting institution, although as to rights, powers, and duties, the resulting Federal savings association is a Federal savings association. Any and all of the assets and other property (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible, including choses in action, rights, and credits) of the converting institution become assets and property of the resulting Federal savings association when the conversion occurs. Similarly, any and all of the obligations and debts of and claims against the converting institution become obligations and debts of and claims against the Federal savings association when the conversion occurs.

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 35, 93a, 214a, 214b, 214c, and 2903.

      (b)  A State bank, a stock State savings association, or a Federal stock savings association must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a national bank charter. A Federal mutual savings association that plans to convert to a national bank must first convert to a Federal stock savings association under 12 CFR part 192.

      (c)  (1) This section describes procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a State bank, a stock State savings association, or a Federal stock savings association to convert to a national bank charter.

      (2) As used in this section,  includes a _State bank_ as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a).

      (d)  Consistent with the OCC's chartering policy, it is OCC policy to allow conversion to a national bank charter by another financial institution that can operate safely and soundly as a national bank in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. A converting financial institution also must obtain all necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals. The OCC may deny an application by any State bank, stock State savings association, and any Federal stock savings association to convert to a national bank charter on the basis of the standards for denial set forth in § 5.13(b), or when conversion would permit the filer to escape supervisory action by its current regulators.

      (e) —(1)  The filer should consult with the appropriate OCC licensing office prior to filing if it anticipates that its application will raise unusual or complex issues. If a prefiling meeting is appropriate, it will normally be held at the OCC licensing office where the application will be filed, but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.

      (2)  A State bank, a Stock state savings association, or a Federal stock savings association must submit its application to convert to a national bank to the appropriate OCC licensing office and send a copy to its current appropriate Federal banking agency. The application must:

      (i) Identify each branch that the resulting bank expects to operate after conversion;

      (ii) Include the institution's most recent audited financial statements (if any);

      (iii) Include the latest report of condition and report of income (the most recent daily statement of condition will suffice if the institution does not file these reports);

      (iv) Unless otherwise advised by the OCC in a prefiling communication, include an opinion of counsel that, in the case of a State bank, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable State law, or in the case of a Federal stock savings association, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable Federal law;

      (v) State whether the institution wishes to exercise fiduciary powers after the conversion;

      (vi) Identify all subsidiaries, bank service company investments, and other equity investments that will be retained following the conversion, and provide the information and analysis of the subsidiaries' activities, the bank service company investments, and the other equity investments that would be required if the converting bank or savings association were a national bank establishing each subsidiary or making each bank service company investment or other equity investment pursuant to § 5.34, § 5.35, § 5.36, § 5.39, 12 CFR part 1, or other applicable law and regulation;

      (vii) Identify any nonconforming assets (including nonconforming subsidiaries) and nonconforming activities that the institution engages in and describe the plans to retain or divest those assets and activities;

      (viii) Include a business plan if the converting institution has been operating for fewer than three years, plans to make significant changes to its business after the conversion, or at the request of the OCC;

      (ix) List all outstanding conditions or other requirements imposed by the institution's current appropriate Federal banking agency and, if applicable, current State bank supervisor or State attorney-general in any cease and desist order, written agreement, other formal enforcement order, memorandum of understanding, approval of any application, notice or request, commitment letter, board resolution, or in any other manner, including the converting institution's analysis whether the conversion is prohibited under 12 U.S.C. 35, and State the institution's plans regarding adhering to such conditions or requirements after conversion;

      (x) Include a list of directors and senior executive officers, as defined in § 5.51, of the converting institution; and

      (xi) Include a list of individuals, directors, and shareholders who directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies, or together with members of their immediate family, do or will own, control, or hold 10 percent or more of the institution's voting stock.

      (3) The OCC may permit a national bank to retain nonconforming assets of a State bank or stock State savings association, subject to conditions and an OCC determination of the carrying value of the retained assets, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 35. The OCC may permit a national bank to continue nonconforming activities of a State bank or stock State savings association, or to retain the nonconforming assets or nonconforming activities of a Federal stock savings association, for a reasonable period of time following a conversion, subject to conditions imposed by the OCC.

      (4) The OCC may require directors and senior executive officers of the converting institution to submit the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at  and legible fingerprints.

      (5) Approval for an institution to convert to a national bank expires if the conversion has not occurred within six months of the OCC's approval of the application, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

      (6) When the OCC determines that the filer has satisfied all statutory and regulatory requirements, including those set forth in 12 U.S.C. 35, and any other conditions, the OCC issues a charter certificate. The certificate provides that the institution is authorized to begin conducting business as a national bank as of a specified date.

      (f) —(1)  A Federal stock savings association may convert to a national bank. In addition to the rules and procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, a Federal stock savings association that desires to convert to a national bank must include in its application information demonstrating compliance with applicable laws regarding the permissibility, requirements, and procedures for conversions, including any applicable stockholder or account holder approval requirements.

      (2)  The appropriate OCC licensing office provides instructions to the converting Federal stock savings association for terminating its status as a Federal stock savings association and beginning its status as a national bank.

      (g)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (h)  An application by an eligible savings association to convert to a national bank charter is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

      (i)  The corporate existence of the converting institution continues in the resulting national bank. The resulting national bank is considered the same business and corporate entity as the converting institution, although as to rights, powers, and duties, the resulting national bank is a national bank. Any and all of the assets and other property (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible, including choses in action, rights, and credits) of the converting institution become assets and property of the resulting national bank when the conversion occurs. Similarly, any and all of the obligations and debts of and claims against the converting institution become obligations and debts of and claims against the national bank when the conversion occurs.

      § 5.25   Conversion from a national bank or Federal savings association to a State bank or State savings association.

#### § § 5.25

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 93a, 214a, 214b, 214c, 214d, 1462a, 1463, 1464, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  A national bank must give notice to the OCC before converting to a State bank (including a State bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a)) or a State savings association.

Termination of a national bank's status as a national bank occurs upon the bank's completion of the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 214a, and upon the OCC's receipt of the bank's national bank charter in connection with the consummation of the conversion.

      (2)  A Federal savings association may convert to a State savings association or to a State bank, without prior OCC approval, subject to compliance with 12 U.S.C. 1464(i)(6).

      (ii) The notice must include:

      (A) A copy of the conversion application; and

      (B) An analysis demonstrating that the conversion is in compliance with laws of the applicable jurisdictions regarding the permissibility, requirements, and procedures for conversions, including any applicable stockholder or account holder approval requirements.

      § 5.26   Fiduciary powers of national banks and Federal savings associations.

#### § § 5.26

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 92a, 1462a, 1463, 1464(n), and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association must submit an application and obtain prior approval from, or in certain circumstances file a notice with, the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers. No approval or notice is required in the following circumstances:

      (1) Where two or more national banks consolidate or merge, and any of the national banks has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting national bank may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the national bank to which approval was originally granted;

      (2) Where two or more Federal savings associations consolidate or merge, and any of the Federal savings associations has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received approval from the OCC or the OTS to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting Federal savings association may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the Federal savings association to which approval was originally granted;

      (3) Where a national bank with prior OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers is the resulting bank in a merger or consolidation with a State bank, State savings association, or Federal savings association and the national bank will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted; and

      (4) Where a Federal savings association with prior approval from the OCC or the OTS to exercise fiduciary powers is the resulting savings association in a merger or consolidation with a State bank, State savings association, or national bank and the Federal savings association will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted.

      (c)  This section sets forth the procedures governing OCC review and approval of an application, and in certain cases the filing of a notice, by a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers. Fiduciary activities of national banks are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 9. Fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 150.

      (d)  The exercise of fiduciary powers is primarily a management decision of the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC generally permits a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers if the bank or savings association is operating in a satisfactory manner, the proposed activities comply with applicable statutes and regulations, and the bank or savings association retains qualified fiduciary management.

      (e) —(1)  The following institutions must obtain approval from the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers:

      (i) A national bank or Federal savings association without fiduciary powers:

      (ii) A national bank without fiduciary powers that desires to exercise fiduciary powers as the resulting bank after merging with a State bank, State savings association, or Federal savings association with fiduciary powers or a Federal savings association without fiduciary powers that desires to exercise fiduciary powers as the resulting savings association after merging with a State bank, State savings association or national bank with fiduciary powers;

      (iii) A national bank that results from the conversion of a State bank or a State or Federal savings association that was exercising fiduciary powers prior to the conversion or a Federal savings association that results from a conversion of a State or national bank or a State savings association that was exercising fiduciary powers prior to the conversion; and

      (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association that has received approval from the OCC to exercise limited fiduciary powers that desires to exercise full fiduciary powers.

      (2)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that desires to exercise fiduciary powers must submit to the OCC an application requesting approval. The application must contain:

      (A) A statement requesting full or limited powers (specifying which powers);

      (B) A statement that the capital and surplus of the national bank or Federal savings association is not less than the capital and surplus required by State law of State banks, trust companies, and other corporations exercising comparable fiduciary powers;

      (C) Sufficient biographical information on proposed senior trust management personnel, as identified by the OCC, to enable the OCC to assess their qualifications, including, if requested by the OCC, legible fingerprints and the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at

      (D) A description of the locations where the national bank or Federal savings association will conduct fiduciary activities;

      (E) If requested by the OCC, an opinion of counsel that the proposed activities do not violate applicable Federal or State law, including citations to applicable law; and

      (F) Any other information necessary to enable the OCC to sufficiently assess the factors described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (ii) If approval to exercise fiduciary powers is desired in connection with any other transaction subject to an application under this part, the filer covered under paragraph (e)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(iii), or (e)(1)(iv) of this section may include a request for approval of fiduciary powers, including the information required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as part of its other application. The OCC does not require a separate application requesting approval to exercise fiduciary powers under these circumstances.

      (iii) When reviewing any application filed under this section, the OCC considers factors such as the following:

      (A) The financial condition of the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (B) The adequacy of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital and surplus and whether it is sufficient under the circumstances and not less than the capital and surplus required by State law or State banks, trust companies, and other corporations exercising comparable fiduciary powers;

      (C) The character and ability of proposed trust management, including qualifications, experience, and competency. The OCC must approve any trust management change the bank or savings association makes prior to commencing trust activities;

      (D) The adequacy of the proposed business plan, if applicable;

      (E) The needs of the community to be served; and

      (F) Any other factors or circumstances that the OCC considers proper.

      (3)  An application by an eligible bank or eligible savings association to exercise fiduciary powers is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the application is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank or savings association prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

      (4)  Approval of an application under this section constitutes a permit under 12 U.S.C. 92a for national banks and 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) for Federal savings associations to conduct the fiduciary powers requested in the application.

      (5)  A national bank or Federal savings association that has ceased to conduct previously approved fiduciary powers for 18 consecutive months must provide the OCC with a notice describing the nature and manner of the activities proposed to be conducted and containing the information required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section 60 days prior to commencing any fiduciary activity.

      (6)  (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(iii) through (iv) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association with existing OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers must provide written notice to the OCC no later than 10 days after it begins to engage in any of the activities specified in § 9.7(d) of this chapter in a State in addition to the State or States described in the application for fiduciary powers that the OCC has approved.

      (ii) A notice submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section must identify the new State or States involved, identify the fiduciary activities to be conducted, and describe the extent to which the activities differ materially from the fiduciary activities the national bank or Federal savings association previously conducted.

      (iii) No notice under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section is required if the national bank or Federal savings association provides the information required by paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section through other means, such as a merger application.

      (iv) No notice is required if the national bank or Federal savings association is conducting only activities ancillary to its fiduciary business through a trust representative office or otherwise.

      (7)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (8)  Approval expires if a national bank or Federal savings association does not commence fiduciary activities within 18 months from the date of approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

    Subpart C—Expansion of Activities

      § 5.30   Establishment, acquisition, and relocation of a branch of a national bank.

#### § § 5.30

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1-42 and 2901-2907.

      (b)  A national bank must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval in order to establish or relocate a branch.

      (c) —(1)  This section describes the procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a national bank to establish a new branch or to relocate a branch.

      (2)  The standards of this section governing review and approval of applications by the OCC and, as applicable, 12 U.S.C. 36(b), but not the application procedures set forth in this section, apply to branches acquired or retained in a conversion approved under § 5.24 or a business combination approved under § 5.33. A branch acquired or retained in a conversion or business combination is subject to the application procedures set forth in § 5.24 or § 5.33.

      (d) —(1)  includes any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office, or any branch place of business established by a national bank in the United States or its territories at which deposits are received, checks paid, or money lent.

      (i) A branch established by a national bank includes a seasonal agency described in 12 U.S.C. 36(c), a mobile facility, a temporary facility, or an intermittent facility.

      (ii) A facility otherwise described in this paragraph (d)(1) is not a branch if:

      (A) The bank establishing the facility does not permit members of the public to have physical access to the facility for purposes of making deposits, paying checks, or borrowing money ( an office established by the bank that receives deposits only through the mail); or

      (B) It is located at the site of, or is an extension of, an approved main office or branch office of the national bank. The OCC determines whether a facility is an extension of an existing main office or branch office on a case-by-case basis. For this purpose, the OCC will consider a drive-in or pedestrian facility located within 500 feet of a public entrance to an existing main office or branch office to be an extension of the existing main office or branch office, provided the functions performed at the drive-in or pedestrian facility are limited to functions that are ordinarily performed at a teller window.

      (iii) A branch does not include a remote service unit (RSU) as described in 12 CFR 7.1027. This encompasses RSUs that are automated teller machines (ATMs), including interactive ATMs. A branch also does not include a loan production office, a deposit production office, a trust office, an administrative office, a data processing office, or any other office that does not engage in at least one of the activities in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (2)  means the State in which the national bank's main office is located.

      (3)  means a branch that is operated by a national bank for one or more limited periods of time to provide branch banking services at a specified recurring event, on the grounds or premises where the event is held or at a fixed site adjacent to the grounds or premises where the event is held, and exclusively during the occurrence of the event. Examples of an intermittent branch include the operation of a branch on the campus of, or at a fixed site adjacent to the campus of, a specific college during school registration periods; or the operation of a branch during a State fair on State fairgrounds or at a fixed site adjacent to the fairgrounds.

      (4)  has the meaning set forth in 12 CFR 7.1012.

      (5)  is a branch of a national bank, other than a messenger service branch, that does not have a single, permanent site, and includes a vehicle that travels to various public locations to enable customers to conduct their banking business. A mobile branch may provide services at various regularly scheduled locations or it may be open at irregular times and locations such as at county fairs, sporting events, or school registration periods. A mobile branch may be stationed continuously at a single location within the geographic area it is approved to serve for a period of up to four months. A branch license is needed for each mobile unit.

      (6)  means a branch of a national bank that is located at a fixed site and which, from the time of its opening, is scheduled to, and will, permanently close no later than a certain date (not longer than one year after the branch is first opened) specified in the branch application and the public notice.

      (e)  In determining whether to approve an application to establish or relocate a branch, the OCC is guided by the following principles:

      (1) Maintaining a safe and sound banking system;

      (2) Encouraging a national bank to provide fair access to financial services by helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community;

      (3) Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; and

      (B) If the Federal savings association intends to change the location of an existing branch office, it must post a notice of its intent in a prominent location in the existing office to be relocated. This notice must be posted for 30 days from the date of publication of the initial public notice described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.

      (C)() No person files a comment opposing the proposed action within 30 days after the date of the publication of the public notice; or

      (2) Any Federal savings association that must obtain approval of the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 1464(m)(1) must follow the application procedures of this section.

      (e) —(1) —(i)  When the OCC evaluates any application for a business combination, the OCC considers the following factors:

      (E) The effect of the transaction on the national bank's or Federal savings association's shareholders (or members in the case of a mutual savings association), depositors, other creditors, and customers.

      (ii)  When the OCC evaluates an application for a business combination under the Bank Merger Act, the OCC also considers the following factors:

      (A)  () The OCC considers the effect of a proposed business combination on competition. The filer must provide a competitive analysis of the transaction, including a definition of the relevant geographic market or markets. A filer may refer to the Comptroller's Licensing Manual for procedures to expedite its competitive analysis.

      () The OCC will deny an application for a business combination if the combination would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. The OCC also will deny any proposed business combination whose effect in any section of the United States may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the probable effects of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the transaction. For purposes of weighing against anticompetitive effects, a business combination may have favorable effects in meeting the convenience and needs of the community if the depository institution being acquired has limited long-term prospects, or if the resulting national bank or Federal savings association will provide significantly improved, additional, or less costly services to the community.

      (B)  The OCC considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing or proposed institutions.

      (C)  The OCC considers the probable effects of the business combination on the convenience and needs of the community served. The filer must describe these effects in its application, including any planned office closings or reductions in services following the business combination and the likely impact on the community. The OCC also considers additional relevant factors, including the resulting national bank's or Federal savings association's ability and plans to provide expanded or less costly services to the community.

      (D)  The OCC considers the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the business combination in combating money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.

      (E)  The OCC considers the risk to the stability of the United States banking and financial system.

      (F)  The OCC will not approve a transaction that would violate the deposit concentration limit in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(13) for interstate merger transactions, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(13)(C)(i).

      (iii) —(A)  The OCC takes into account the filer's _Community Reinvestment Act_ (CRA) record of performance in considering an application for a business combination. The OCC's conclusion of whether the CRA performance is or is not consistent with approval of an application is considered in conjunction with the other factors of this section.

      (B)  The OCC considers the CRA record of performance of the filer and its resulting bank affiliates and the filer's record of compliance with applicable State community reinvestment laws when required by 12 U.S.C. 1831u(b)(3).

      (C)  A filer must:

      () Disclose whether it has entered into and disclosed a covered agreement, as defined in _1_2 CFR 35.2, in accordance with 12 CFR 35.6 and 35.7; and

      () Provide summaries of, or documents relating to, all substantive discussions with respect to the development of the content of a covered agreement disclosed in (e)(_1_)(iii)(C)() that include the names of participants, dates, and synopsis of the discussions.

      (iv)  The OCC considers the standards and requirements contained in 12 U.S.C. 1831u for interstate merger transactions between insured banks, when applicable.

      (2)  A filer must disclose the location of any branch it will acquire and retain in a business combination, including approved but unopened branches. The OCC considers the acquisition and retention of a branch under the standards set out in § 5.30 or § 5.31, as applicable, but it does not require a separate application.

      (3)  (i) A filer must identify any subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment to be acquired in a business combination and state the activities of each subsidiary or other company in which the filer would be acquiring an investment. The OCC does not require a separate application or notice under §§ 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, 5.38, 5.39, 5.58, and 5.59.

      (ii) A national bank filer proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a national bank must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the filer were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to §§ 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, or 5.39.

      (iii) A Federal savings association filer proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a Federal savings association must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the filer were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to §§ 5.35, 5.38, 5.58, or 5.59.

      (4) —(i)  A filer for a business combination that plans to use an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association to accomplish the transaction must file an application to organize an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association as part of the application for the related business combination.

      (ii)  The OCC grants conditional preliminary approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association when it acknowledges receipt of the application for the related business combination.

      (iii)  An interim national bank or interim Federal savings association becomes a legal entity and may enter into legally valid agreements when it has filed, and the OCC has accepted, the interim national bank's duly executed articles of association and organization certificate or the Federal savings association's charter and bylaws. OCC acceptance occurs:

      (A) On the date the OCC advises the interim national bank that its articles of association and organization certificate are acceptable or advises the interim Federal savings association that its charter and bylaws are acceptable; or

      (B) On the date the interim national bank files articles of association and an organization certificate that conform to the form for those documents provided by the OCC in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual or the date the interim Federal savings association files a charter and bylaws that conform to the requirements set out in this part 5.

      (iv)  A filer should consult the Comptroller's Licensing Manual to determine what other information is necessary to complete the chartering of the interim national bank as a national bank or the interim Federal savings association as a Federal savings association.

      (5)  (i) A filer must identify any nonconforming activities and assets, including nonconforming subsidiaries, of other institutions involved in the business combination that will not be disposed of or discontinued prior to consummation of the transaction. The OCC generally requires a national bank or Federal savings association to divest or conform nonconforming assets, or discontinue nonconforming activities, within a reasonable time following the business combination.

      (ii) Any resulting Federal savings association must conform to the requirements of sections 5(c) and 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c) and 1467a(m)) within the time period prescribed by the OCC.

      (6)  (i) A filer must state whether the resulting national bank or Federal savings association intends to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to § 5.26(b).

      (ii) If a filer intends to exercise fiduciary powers after the combination and requires OCC approval for such powers, the filer must include the information required under § 5.26(e)(2).

      (7)  Approval of a business combination, and conditional approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association, if applicable, expires if the business combination is not consummated within six months after the date of OCC approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

      (8)  (i) A filer must inform shareholders of all material aspects of a business combination and must comply with any applicable requirements of the Federal securities laws and securities regulations of the OCC. Accordingly, a filer must ensure that all proxy and information statements prepared in connection with a business combination do not contain any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

      (5)  (i) With the approval of the OCC, a national bank that is not an insured bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(h) may merge with one or more of its nonbank affiliates, with the nonbank affiliate as the resulting entity, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, provided that the law of the State or other jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is organized allows the nonbank affiliate to engage in such mergers.

However, for these purposes the references in 12 U.S.C. 214c to “law of the State in which such national banking association is located” and “any State authority” mean “laws and regulations governing Federal savings associations” and “Office of the Comptroller of the Currency” respectively.

In making this determination the Comptroller will consider whether any party has acted arbitrarily or not in good faith in respect to the rights provided by this paragraph.

      () Unless the Federal savings association has elected to follow the procedures applicable to State savings associations under paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A), the plan of merger or consolidation must provide the manner of disposing of the shares of the resulting Federal savings association not taken by the dissenting shareholders of the Federal savings association.

      (D)() A State bank, State savings association, State trust company, or credit union entering into a consolidation or merger with a Federal savings association when the resulting institution will be a Federal savings association must follow the procedures for such consolidations or mergers set out in the law of the State or other jurisdiction under which the State bank, State savings association, State trust company, or credit union is organized.

When the national bank or Federal savings association files the notice under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, the OCC provides instructions to the national bank or Federal savings association for terminating its status as a national bank or Federal savings association, including surrendering its charter to the OCC immediately after consummation of the transaction.

      (5)  If the action contemplated by the notice is not completed within six months after the OCC's receipt of the notice, a new notice must be submitted to the OCC, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

      (m)  (1) When a national bank or Federal savings association is the filer and will be the resulting entity in a consolidation or merger, after receiving approval from the OCC, it must complete any remaining steps needed to complete the transaction, provide the OCC with a certification that all other required regulatory or shareholder approvals have been obtained, and inform the OCC of the planned consummation date.

      (2) When the transaction is consummated, the filer must notify the OCC of the consummation date. The OCC will issue a letter certifying that the combination was effective on the date specified in the filer's notice.

      (2) A Federal savings association may consolidate or merge with another depository institution, a State trust company or a credit union, may engage in another business combination listed in paragraphs (d)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, or may engage in any other combination listed in paragraph (d)(10), provided that:

      (ii) Any resulting Federal savings association meets the requirements for insurance of accounts; and

      (3) Where the resulting institution is a Federal mutual savings association, the OCC may approve a temporary increase in the number of directors of the resulting institution provided that the association submits a plan for bringing the board of directors into compliance with the requirements of § 5.21(e) within a reasonable period of time.

      (4)(i) The Federal savings associations described in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of this section below must provide affected accountholders with a notice of a proposed account transfer and an option of retaining the account in the transferring Federal savings association.

If any class of shares is entitled to vote as a class pursuant to § 5.22(g)(4), an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of each voting class and two-thirds of the total voting shares is required. The required vote must be taken at a meeting of the savings association.

      (B)  Stockholders of the resulting Federal stock savings association need not authorize a consolidation or merger if the transaction meets the requirements of paragraph (p) of this section.

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 24a, 25b, 93a, 3102(b).

      (b)  A national bank must file an application or notice as prescribed in this section to acquire or establish an operating subsidiary, or to commence a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.

      (c)  This section sets forth authorized activities and application or notice procedures for national banks engaging in activities through an operating subsidiary. The procedures in this section do not apply to financial subsidiaries authorized under § 5.39. Unless provided otherwise, this section applies to a Federal branch or agency that acquires, establishes, or maintains any subsidiary that a national bank is authorized to acquire or establish under this section in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Federal branch or agency were a national bank, except that the ownership interest required in paragraphs (e)(_2_) and (f)(2)(i)(C)() of this section applies to the parent foreign bank of the Federal branch or agency and not to the Federal branch or agency. The OCC may, at any time, limit a national bank's investment in an operating subsidiary or may limit or refuse to permit any activities in an operating subsidiary for supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness reasons.

      (d)  For purposes of this section,  means a product that would be defined as insurance under section 302(c) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6712) that, as of January 1, 1999, the OCC had determined in writing that national banks may provide as principal or national banks were in fact lawfully providing the product as principal, and as of that date no court of relevant jurisdiction had, by final judgment, overturned a determination by the OCC that national banks may provide the product as principal. An _authorized product_ does not include title insurance, or an annuity contract the income of which is subject to treatment under section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 72).

      (e) —(1)  (i) A national bank may conduct in an operating subsidiary activities that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly either as part of, or incidental to, the business of banking, as determined by the OCC, or otherwise under other statutory authority, including:

      (A) Providing authorized products as principal; and

      (B) Providing title insurance as principal if the national bank or subsidiary thereof was actively and lawfully underwriting title insurance before November 12, 1999, and no affiliate of the national bank (other than a subsidiary) provides insurance as principal. A subsidiary may not provide title insurance as principal if the State had in effect before November 12, 1999, a law which prohibits any person from underwriting title insurance with respect to real property in that State.

      (ii) In addition to OCC authorization, before it begins business an operating subsidiary also must comply with other laws applicable to it and its proposed business, including applicable licensing or registration requirements, if any, such as registration requirements under securities laws.

      (2)  (i) An operating subsidiary in which a national bank may invest includes a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or similar entity if:

      (A) The bank has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary, and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof;

      (B) The parent bank owns and controls more than 50 percent of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary, or the parent bank otherwise controls the operating subsidiary and no other party controls a percentage of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary greater than the bank's interest; and

      (C) The operating subsidiary is consolidated with the bank under GAAP.

      (ii) However, the following entities are not operating subsidiaries subject to this section:

      (A) A subsidiary in which the bank's investment is made pursuant to specific authorization in a statute or OCC regulation ( a bank service company under 12 U.S.C. 1861  a financial subsidiary under section 5136A of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24a), or a community development corporation subsidiary under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh) and 12 CFR part 24;

      (B) A subsidiary in which the bank has acquired, in good faith, shares through foreclosure on collateral, by way of compromise of a doubtful claim, or to avoid a loss in connection with a debt previously contracted; and

      (C) A trust formed for purposes of securitizing assets held by the bank as part of its banking business.

      (iii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,

      (A) A national bank must have reasonable policies and procedures to preserve the limited liability of the bank and its operating subsidiaries; and

      (B) OCC regulations may not be construed as requiring a national bank and its operating subsidiaries to operate as a single entity.

      (3)  An operating subsidiary conducts activities authorized under this section pursuant to the same authorization, terms and conditions that apply to the conduct of such activities by its parent national bank, unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, regulation, or published OCC policy, including sections 1044 and 1045 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 25b) with respect to the application of State law. If the OCC determines that the operating subsidiary is operating in violation of law, regulation, or written condition, or in an unsafe or unsound manner or otherwise threatens the safety or soundness of the bank, the OCC will direct the bank or operating subsidiary to take appropriate remedial action, which may include requiring the bank to divest or liquidate the operating subsidiary, or discontinue specified activities. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (4) —(i)  Pertinent book figures of the parent national bank and its operating subsidiary will be combined for the purpose of applying statutory or regulatory limitations when combination is needed to effect the intent of the statute or regulation,  for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 56, 59, 60, 84, and 371d.

      (ii)  Transactions conducted by all of a foreign bank's Federal branches and agencies and State branches and agencies, and their operating subsidiaries, will be combined for the purpose of applying any limitation or restriction as provided in 12 CFR 28.14.

      (f) —(1)  (i) Except for an operating subsidiary that qualifies for the notice procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or is exempt from application or notice requirements under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, a national bank must first submit an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.

      (ii) The application must explain, as appropriate, how the bank “controls” the enterprise, describing in full detail structural arrangements where control is based on factors other than bank ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the subsidiary and the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management. In the case of a limited partnership or limited liability company that does not qualify for the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the bank must provide a statement explaining why it is not eligible. The application also must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the bank and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the main office or a previously approved branch of the bank. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (2)  (i) Except for an operating subsidiary that is exempt from application or notice procedures under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, a national bank that is well capitalized and well managed may establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, by providing the appropriate OCC licensing office written notice prior to, or within 10 days after, acquiring or establishing the subsidiary, or commencing the new activity, if:

      (A) The activity is listed in paragraph (f)(5) of this section or, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity and the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;

      (B) The entity is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or trust; and

      (C) The bank or an operating subsidiary thereof:

      () Has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof. The ability to control the management and operations means:

      () In the case of a subs_i_diary that is a corporation, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof holds voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management; or

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to replace the trustee at will;

      () Holds more than 50 percent of the voting, or equivalent, interests in the subsidiary and:

      () In the case of a subs_i_diary that is a limited partnership, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole general partner of the limited partnership, provided that under the partnership agreement, limited partners have no authority to bind the partnership by virtue solely of their status as limited partners;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole managing member of the limited liability company, provided that under the limited liability company agreement, other limited liability company members have no authority to bind the limited liability company by virtue solely of their status as members; or

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficial owner of the trust; and

      () Is required to consolidate its financial statements with those of the subsidiary under GAAP.

      (ii) A national bank must file an application under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if a State has or will charter or license the proposed operating subsidiary as a bank, trust company, or savings association.

      (iii) The written notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary and of the activity conducted and a representation and undertaking that the activity will be conducted in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activity. To the extent that the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank also must list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (3)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (4)  The OCC reviews a national bank's application to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible under Federal banking laws and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent national bank. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.

      (5)  The following activities qualify for the notice procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided the activity is conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a national bank:

      (i) Holding and managing assets acquired by the parent bank or its operating subsidiaries, including investment assets and property acquired by the bank through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted;

      (c)  This section describes the procedures and requirements regarding OCC review and approval of a notice by a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in the equity of a bank service company. The OCC may, at any time, limit a national bank's or Federal savings association's investment in a bank service company or may limit or refuse to permit any activities in any bank service company for which a national bank or Federal savings association is the principal investor for supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness reasons.

      (d) —(1)  means a corporation or limited liability company organized to provide services authorized by the Bank Service Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1861  all of whose capital stock is owned by one or more insured depository institutions in the case of a corporation, or all of the members of which are one or more insured depository institutions in the case of a limited liability company.

      (2)  means any company, partnership, trust, or similar business entity organized under the law of a State (as defined in section 3(a)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(3)) which provides that a member or manager of such company is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the company solely by reason of being, or acting as, a member or manager of such company.

      (5)  includes making any advance of funds to a bank service company, whether by the purchase of stock, the making of a loan, or otherwise, except a payment for rent earned, goods sold and delivered, or services rendered before the payment was made.

      (6)  means the insured depository institution that has the largest amount invested in the equity of a bank service company. In any case where two or more insured depository institutions have equal amounts invested and no other insured depository institution has a larger amount invested, the bank service company must designate one of those insured depository institutions as its principal investor.

      (e)  A national bank or Federal savings association may invest in a bank service company that conducts activities described in paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this section and activities (other than taking deposits) permissible for the national bank or Federal savings association and other insured depository institution shareholders or members of the bank service company.

      (f) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that intends to invest in the equity of a bank service company, or to perform new activities in an existing bank service company, must submit a notice to and receive prior approval from the OCC. The notice must include the information required by paragraph (g) of this section. The OCC approves or denies a proposed investment within 60 days after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing presents a significant supervisory or compliance concern, or raises a significant legal or policy issue.

      (2)  (i) A notice to invest in the equity of a bank service company, or to perform new activities in an existing bank service company, that meets the requirements of this paragraph is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the notice is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review or the expedited review process is extended. Any bank or savings association making an investment pursuant to this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the bank service company will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with the published OCC guidance.

      (3)  A national bank or Federal savings association does not need to submit a notice or obtain OCC approval to invest in a bank service company, or to perform a new activity in an existing bank service company, if the bank service company will provide only the following services only for depository institutions: Check and deposit posting and sorting; computation and posting of interest and other credits and charges; preparation and mailing of checks, statements, notices, and similar items; or any other clerical, bookkeeping, accounting, statistical, or similar functions.

      (4)  A national bank or Federal savings association also may, with the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), invest in the equity of a bank service company that provides any other service (except deposit taking) that the Federal Reserve Board has determined, by regulation, to be permissible for a bank holding company under 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).

      (5)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to a request for approval to invest in a bank service company. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all provisions of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (g)  A notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must contain the following:

      (1) The name and location of the bank service company;

      (2) A complete description of the activities the bank service company will conduct and a representation and undertaking that the activities will be conducted in accordance with OCC guidance. To the extent the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the national bank or Federal savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the national bank or Federal savings association should describe the type of insurance activity that the company is engaged in and has present plans to conduct. The national bank or Federal savings association also must list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable;

      (3) A complete description of the national bank's or Federal savings association's investment in the bank service company and information demonstrating that the national bank or Federal savings association will comply with the investment limitations of paragraph (i) of this section; and

      (4) Information demonstrating that the bank service company will perform only those services that each insured depository institution shareholder or member is authorized to perform under applicable Federal or State law and will perform such services only at locations in a State in which each such shareholder or member is authorized to perform such services unless performing services that are authorized by the Federal Reserve Board under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 1865(b).

      (h)  Each bank service company in which a national bank or Federal savings association is the principal investor is subject to examination and supervision by the OCC in the same manner and to the same extent as that national bank or Federal savings association. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (4) Describe how the bank has the ability to prevent the enterprise from engaging in activities that are not set forth in § 5.34(f)(5) or not contained in published OCC precedent for previously approved activities, or how the bank otherwise has the ability to withdraw its investment;

      (5) Describe how the investment is convenient and useful to the bank in carrying out its business and not a mere passive investment unrelated to the bank's banking business;

      (6) Certify that the bank's loss exposure is limited as a legal matter and that the bank does not have unlimited liability for the obligations of the enterprise; and

      (7) Certify that the enterprise in which the bank is investing agrees to be subject to OCC supervision and examination, subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (f) —(1)  A national bank must file an application and obtain prior approval before making or acquiring, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a non-controlling investment in an enterprise if the non-controlling investment does not qualify for the notice procedure set forth in paragraph (e) of this section because the bank is unable to make the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) or the certifications required by paragraphs (e)(3) or (e)(7) of this section. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, the information required by paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the bank is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the bank's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a national bank and why the filer should be permitted to hold a non-controlling investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity. A bank may not make a non-controlling investment if it is unable to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section.

      (2)  An application submitted by a national bank is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 10th day after the application is received by the OCC if:

      (i) The national bank makes the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) and the certification required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section;

      (ii) The book value of the national bank's non-controlling investment for which the application is being submitted is no more than 1% of the bank's capital and surplus;

      (iii) No more than 50% of the enterprise is owned or controlled by banks or savings associations subject to examination by an appropriate Federal banking agency or credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Association; and

      (iv) The OCC has not notified the national bank that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

      (g)  A national bank may make or acquire, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a non-controlling investment in an enterprise without an application or notice to the OCC, if the:

      (1) Activities of the enterprise are limited to those activities previously reported by the bank in connection with the making or acquiring of a non-controlling investment;

      (2) Activities of the enterprise continue to be legally permissible for a national bank;

      (3) The bank's non-controlling investment will be made in accordance with any conditions imposed by the OCC in approving any prior non-controlling investment in an enterprise conducting these same activities; and

      (4) The bank is able to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(7) of this section.

      (h)  Certain non-controlling investments may be eligible for expedited treatment where the bank's investment is in an entity holding assets in satisfaction of debts previously contracted or the bank acquires shares of a company in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.

      (1)  A national bank that is well capitalized and well managed may acquire a non-controlling investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in the activities of holding and managing assets acquired by the parent bank through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted, by filing a written notice in accordance with this paragraph (h)(1). The activities of the enterprise must be conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a national bank. The bank must file the written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the non-controlling investment. This notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the enterprise and the activities conducted, a description of how the bank plans to divest the non-controlling investment or the underlying assets within applicable statutory time frames, and a representation and undertaking that the bank will conduct the activities in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activities. Any national bank receiving approval under this paragraph (h)(1) is deemed to have agreed that the enterprise will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (2)  A national bank is not required to file a notice or application under this § 5.36 if it acquires a non-controlling investment in shares of a company through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted.

      (i)  A Federal branch that is well capitalized and well managed may make a non-controlling investment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in the same manner and subject to the same conditions and requirements as a national bank, and subject to any additional requirements that may apply under 12 CFR 28.10(c).

      (j)  Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      § 5.37   Investment in national bank or Federal savings association premises.

#### § § 5.37

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 29, 93a, 371d, 1464(c)(2), 1464(c)(4)(B), 1828(m), and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  This section addresses a national bank's or Federal savings association's investment in banking premises and other premises-related investments, loans, or indebtedness. This section also sets forth the quantitative investment limitations and procedures governing the OCC's review and approval of an application by a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in these premises.

      (c)  The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

      (1)  includes:

      (i) Premises that are owned and occupied (or to be occupied, if under construction) by a national bank or Federal savings association, its respective branches, or its consolidated subsidiaries;

      (ii) Capitalized leases and leasehold improvements, vaults, and fixed machinery and equipment;

      (iii) Remodeling costs to existing premises;

      (iv) Real estate acquired and intended, in good faith, for use in future expansion; or

      (v) Parking facilities that are used by customers or employees of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (2)  means, for national banks and Federal stock savings associations, the amount of common stock outstanding and unimpaired plus the amount of perpetual preferred stock outstanding and unimpaired. With respect to Federal mutual savings associations, “capital stock” should be read to mean the amount of the association's retained earnings.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  A national bank or Federal savings association must submit an application to the appropriate OCC supervisory office to invest in banking premises, or in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other such obligations of any corporation, partnership, or similar entity ( a limited liability company) holding the premises of the national bank or Federal savings association, or to make loans to or upon the security of the stock of such corporation, if the aggregate of all such investments and loans, together with the indebtedness incurred by any such corporation that is an affiliate of the national bank or Federal savings association, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 221a or 12 U.S.C. 1462, respectively, will exceed the amount of the capital stock of the national bank or Federal savings association, or, in the case of a Federal mutual savings association the amount of retained earnings.

      (ii)  The application must include:

      (A) A description of the national bank's or Federal savings association's present investment in banking premises;

      (B) The investment in banking premises that the national bank or Federal savings association intends to make, and the business reason for making the investment; and

      (C) The amount by which the national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate investment will exceed the amount of the national bank's or Federal stock savings association's capital stock, or, in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, the amount of retained earnings.

      (2)  An application from a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in banking premises or in certain banking premises-related investments, loans or indebtedness, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, is deemed approved as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association prior to that date that the filing presents a significant supervisory or compliance concern, or raises a significant legal or policy issue. An approval for a specified amount under this section remains valid up to that amount until the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association otherwise.

      (3) —(i)  Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that is rated 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (CAMELS) may make an aggregate investment in banking premises up to 150 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital and surplus without the OCC's prior approval, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized and will continue to be well capitalized after the investment or loan is made. However, the national bank or Federal savings association must notify the appropriate OCC supervisory office in writing of the investment within 30 days after the investment or loan is made. The written notice must include a description of the national bank's or Federal savings association's investment or loan.

      (ii)  If a Federal savings association that would otherwise be eligible for the premises notice process described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section proposes to establish or acquire a subsidiary to make an investment in banking premises, or if investing in banking premises would be a new activity for such a subsidiary, the Federal savings association would not be eligible for the premises notice process and would be required to comply with the provisions of § 5.59 in the case of a service corporation, or § 5.38 in the case of an operating subsidiary.

      (4)  A Federal savings association that invests in banking premises through a service corporation is not subject to the premises application and premises notice requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; however, it must include this investment when calculating the quantitative limitations in paragraph (d) of this section, and must comply with § 5.59.

      (5)  Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      § 5.38   Operating subsidiaries of a Federal savings association.

#### § § 5.38

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1465, 1828, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(m)), a Federal savings association must file an application as prescribed in this section to acquire or establish an operating subsidiary, or to commence a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.

      (c)  This section sets forth authorized activities and application procedures for Federal savings associations engaging in activities through an operating subsidiary. The OCC may, at any time, limit a Federal savings association's investment in an operating subsidiary or may limit or refuse to permit any activities in an operating subsidiary for supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness reasons.

      (d) [Reserved]

      (e) —(1)  (i) A Federal savings association may conduct in an operating subsidiary activities that are permissible for a Federal savings association to engage in directly.

      (ii) In addition to OCC authorization, before it begins business an operating subsidiary also must comply with other laws applicable to it and its proposed business, including applicable licensing or registration requirements, if any, such as registration requirements under securities laws.

      (2)  (i) An operating subsidiary in which a Federal savings association may invest includes a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or similar entity if:

      (A) The savings association has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary, and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof;

      (B) The parent savings association owns and controls more than 50 percent of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary, or the parent savings association otherwise controls the operating subsidiary and no other party controls a percentage of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary greater than the savings association's interest; and

      (C) The operating subsidiary is consolidated with the savings association under GAAP.

      (ii) Subject to the requirements in this section, a Federal savings association may hold another insured depository institution as an operating subsidiary.

      (iii) However, the following entities are not operating subsidiaries subject to this section:

      (A) A subsidiary in which the savings association's investment is made pursuant to specific authorization in a statute or OCC regulation ( a service corporation under 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4) or a bank service company under 12 U.S.C. 1861 );

      (B) A subsidiary in which the savings association has acquired, in good faith, shares through foreclosure on collateral, by way of compromise of a doubtful claim, or to avoid a loss in connection with a debt previously contracted; and

      (C) A trust formed for purpose of securitizing assets held by the savings association as part of its business.

      (iv) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section:

      (A) A Federal savings association must have reasonable policies and procedures to preserve the limited liability of the savings association and its operating subsidiaries; and

      (B) OCC regulations may not be construed as requiring a Federal savings association and its operating subsidiaries to operate as a single entity.

      (3)  An operating subsidiary conducts activities authorized under this section pursuant to the same authorization, terms and conditions that apply to the conduct of such activities by its parent Federal savings association, unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, regulation, or published OCC policy, including sections 1045 and 1046 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 25b and 1465) with respect to the application of State law. If the OCC determines that the operating subsidiary is operating in violation of law, regulation, or written condition, or in an unsafe or unsound manner or otherwise threatens the safety or soundness of the savings association, the OCC will direct the savings association or operating subsidiary to take appropriate remedial action, which may include requiring the savings association to divest or liquidate the operating subsidiary, or discontinue specified activities. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (4)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, pertinent book figures of the parent Federal savings association and its operating subsidiary must be combined for the purpose of applying statutory or regulatory limitations when combination is needed to effect the intent of the statute or regulation,  for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1464(c) and 1464(u).

      (ii) Consolidation for purposes of calculating portfolio assets and qualified thrift investments is subject to 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m)(5).

      (f) —(1)  (i) A Federal savings association must first submit an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.

      (ii) The application must explain, as appropriate, how the savings association “controls” the enterprise, describing in full detail structural arrangements where control is based on factors other than savings association ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the subsidiary and the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management. In the case of a limited partnership or limited liability company that does not qualify for the expedited review procedure set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the savings association must provide a statement explaining why it is not eligible. The application also must include a complete description of the savings association's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the savings association and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the savings association must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the home office or a previously approved branch of the savings association. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (2)  (i) An application to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, that meets the requirements of this paragraph is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended under § 5.13(a)(2). Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (ii) An application is eligible for expedited review if all of the following requirements are met:

      (A) The savings association is well capitalized and well managed;

      (B) The activity is listed in paragraph (f)(5) this section or is substantively the same as a previously approved activity and the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;

      (C) The entity is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or trust; and

      (D) The savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof:

      () Has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof. The ability to control the management and operations means:

      () In the case of a subs_i_diary that is a corporation, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof holds voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management; or

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to replace the trustee at will;

      () Holds more than 50 percent of the voting, or equivalent, interests in the subsidiary, and:

      () In the case of a subs_i_diary that is a limited partnership, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole general partner of the limited partnership, provided that under the partnership agreement, limited partners have no authority to bind the partnership by virtue solely of their status as limited partners;

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole managing member of the limited liability company, provided that under the limited liability company agreement, other limited liability company members have no authority to bind the limited liability company by virtue solely of their status as members; or

      () In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficial owner of the trust; and

      () Is required to consolidate its financial statements with those of the subsidiary under GAAP. A filer proposing to qualify for expedited review must include in the application all necessary information showing the application meets the requirements.

      (3)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (4)  The OCC reviews a Federal savings association's application to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible under Federal savings association law and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent Federal savings association. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.

      (5)  The following activities qualify for the expedited review procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided the activity is conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a Federal savings association:

      (i) Holding and managing assets acquired by the parent savings association or its operating subsidiaries, including investment assets and property acquired by the savings association through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted;

      (ii) Providing services to or for the savings association or its affiliates, including accounting, auditing, appraising, advertising and public relations, and financial advice and consulting;

      (iii) Making loans or other extensions of credit, and selling money orders and travelers checks;

      (iv) Purchasing, selling, servicing, or warehousing loans or other extensions of credit, or interests therein;

      (v) Providing management consulting, operational advice, and services for other financial institutions;

      (vi) Providing check payment services;

      (vii) Acting as investment adviser (including an adviser with investment discretion) or financial adviser or counselor to governmental entities or instrumentalities, businesses, or individuals, including advising registered investment companies and mortgage or real estate investment trusts;

      (viii) Providing financial and transactional advice and assistance, including advice and assistance for customers in structuring, arranging, and executing mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, leveraged buyouts, swaps, foreign exchange, derivative transactions, coin and bullion, and capital restructurings;

      (ix) Underwriting and reinsuring credit life and disability insurance;

      (x) Leasing of personal property;

      (xi) Providing securities brokerage;

      (xii) Underwriting and dealing, including making a market, in savings association permissible securities and purchasing and selling as principal, asset backed obligations;

      (xiii) Acting as an insurance agent or broker for credit life, disability, and unemployment insurance; single property interest insurance; and title insurance;

      (xiv) Offering correspondent services to the extent permitted by published OCC precedent for Federal savings associations;

      (xv) Acting as agent or broker in the sale of fixed annuities;

      (xvi) Offering debt cancellation or debt suspension agreements;

      (xvii) Providing escrow services;

      (xviii) Acting as a transfer agent; and

      (xix) Providing or selling postage stamps.

      (6)  A Federal savings association that proposes to redesignate a service corporation as an operating subsidiary must submit a notification to the OCC at least 30 days prior to the redesignation date. The notification must include a description of how the redesignated service corporation meets all of the requirements of this section to be an operating subsidiary, a resolution of the savings association's board of directors approving the redesignation, and the proposed effective date of the redesignation. The savings association may effect the redesignation on the proposed date unless the OCC notifies the savings association otherwise prior to that date. The OCC may require an application if the redesignation presents policy, supervisory, or legal issues.

      (7)  (i) If an operating subsidiary proposes to accept fiduciary appointments for which fiduciary powers are required, such as acting as trustee or executor, then the Federal savings association must have fiduciary powers under section 5(n) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(n), and the subsidiary also must have its own fiduciary powers under the law applicable to the subsidiary.

      (ii) Unless the subsidiary is a registered investment adviser, if an operating subsidiary proposes to exercise investment discretion on behalf of customers or provide investment advice for a fee, the Federal savings association must have prior OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to § 5.26 (or a predecessor provision) and 12 CFR part 150.

      (8)  Approval expires if the Federal savings association has not established or acquired the operating subsidiary, or commenced the new activity in an existing operating subsidiary within 12 months after the date of the approval, unless the OCC shortens or extends the time period.

      (g)  Notwithstanding the requirements for a qualifying operating subsidiary in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and unless otherwise notified by the OCC with respect to a particular operating subsidiary, an entity that a Federal savings association lawfully acquired or established as an operating subsidiary before May 18, 2015, may continue to operate as a Federal savings association operating subsidiary under this section, provided that the savings association and the operating subsidiary were, and continue to be, conducting authorized activities in compliance with the standards and requirements applicable when the savings association established or acquired the operating subsidiary.

      (h)  An operating subsidiary may not state or imply that the securities it issues are covered by Federal deposit insurance. An operating subsidiary may not issue any security the payment, maturity, or redemption of which may be accelerated upon the condition that the controlling Federal savings association is insolvent or has been placed into receivership. For as long as any securities are outstanding, the controlling Federal savings association must maintain all records generated through each securities issuance in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to a copy of the prospectus, offering circular, or similar document concerning such issuance, and make such records available for examination by the OCC.

      (j) —(1)  A national bank, or, as applicable, its affiliated depository institutions, must continue to satisfy the qualification requirements set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section and the safeguards in paragraphs (h)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section following its acquisition of control of, or an interest in, a financial subsidiary. A national bank that fails to continue to satisfy these requirements will be subject to the following procedures and requirements:

      (i) The OCC will give notice to the national bank and, in the case of an affiliated depository institution to that depository institution's appropriate Federal banking agency, promptly upon determining that the national bank, or, as applicable, its affiliated depository institution, does not continue to meet the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section or the safeguards in paragraph (h)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section.

      (2)  A national bank that does not continue to meet the qualification requirement set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, applicable where the bank's financial subsidiary is engaged in activities other than solely in an agency capacity, may not directly or through a subsidiary, purchase or acquire any additional equity capital of any such financial subsidiary until the bank meets the requirement in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2), the term “equity capital” includes, in addition to any equity investment, any debt instrument issued by the financial subsidiary if the instrument qualifies as capital of the subsidiary under Federal or State law, regulation, or interpretation applicable to the subsidiary.

      (k)  A financial subsidiary is subject to examination and supervision by the OCC, subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (c) —(1)  A national bank may request a waiver of the residency requirement for any number of directors by filing a written application with the OCC. The OCC may grant a waiver on an individual basis or for any number of director positions. The waiver is valid until the OCC revokes it in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or, if granted on an individual basis, until the individual no longer serves on the board.

      (2)  A national bank may request a waiver of the citizenship requirements for individuals who comprise up to a minority of the total number of directors by filing a written application with the OCC. The OCC may grant a waiver on an individual basis. A citizenship waiver is valid until the individual no longer serves on the board or the OCC revokes the waiver in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (3)  (i) Each subject of a citizenship waiver application must submit to the appropriate OCC licensing office the information prescribed in the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at

      (ii) The OCC may require additional information about any subject of a citizenship waiver application, including legible fingerprints, if appropriate. The OCC may waive any of the information requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) if the OCC determines that doing so is in the public interest.

      (4)  Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section.

      (d) —(1)  The OCC may revoke a residency or citizenship waiver. Before revocation, the OCC will provide written notice to the national bank and affected director(s) of its intention to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver and the basis for its intention. The bank and affected director(s) may respond in writing to the OCC within 10 calendar days, unless the OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of relevant circumstances. The OCC will consider the written responses of the bank and affected director(s), if any, prior to deciding whether or not to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver. The OCC will notify the national bank and the director of the OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver in writing.

      (2)  The OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver is effective:

      (i) If the director or national bank, or both, appeals pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, upon the director's receipt of the decision of the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official, to uphold the initial decision to revoke the residency or citizenship waiver; or

      (ii) If neither the director nor national bank appeals pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, upon the expiration of the period to appeal.

      (e)  (1) A director or national bank, or both, may seek review by appealing the OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver to the Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, within 15 days of the receipt of the OCC's written decision to revoke. The director or national bank, or both, may appeal on the grounds that the reasons for revocation are contrary to fact or arbitrary and capricious. The appellant must submit all documents and written arguments that the appellant wishes to be considered in support of the appeal.

      (2) The Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, may designate an appellate official who was not previously involved in the decision leading to the appeal at issue. The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official considers all information submitted with the original application for the residency or citizenship waiver, the material before the OCC official who made the initial decision, and any information submitted by the appellant at the time of appeal.

      (3) The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will independently determine whether the reasons given for the initial decision to revoke are contrary to fact or arbitrary and capricious. If they determine either to be the case, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official may reverse the initial decision to revoke the waiver.

      (4) Upon completion of the review, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will notify the appellant in writing of the decision. If the initial decision is upheld, the decision to revoke the waiver is effective pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

      (f)  Any waiver granted by the OCC before January 11, 2021 remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section or, for a waiver granted to an individual, until the individual no longer serves on the board.

      (b)  A national bank must submit an application and obtain OCC approval to decrease its permanent capital. Generally, a national bank need only submit a notice to increase its permanent capital, although, in certain circumstances, a national bank may be required to submit an application and obtain OCC approval.

      (c)  This section describes procedures and standards relating to a transaction resulting in a change in a national bank's permanent capital.

      (d)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to changes in a national bank's permanent capital.

      (e)  For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:

      (1)  means a plan describing the manner and schedule by which a national bank will attain specified capital levels or ratios and a capital restoration plan filed with the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.5.

      (2)  means the total amount of common stock and preferred stock.

      (3)  means the total of:

      (i) The amount paid in on capital stock in excess of the par or stated value;

      (ii) Direct capital contributions representing the amounts paid in to the national bank other than for capital stock;

      (iii) The amount transferred from undivided profits; and

      (iv) The amount transferred from undivided profits reflecting stock dividends.

      (4)  means the sum of capital stock and capital surplus.

      (f)  In determining whether to approve a proposed change to a national bank's permanent capital, the OCC considers whether the change is:

      (1) Consistent with law, regulation, and OCC policy thereunder;

      (2) Provides an adequate capital structure; and

      (3) If appropriate, complies with the bank's capital plan.

      (g) —(1) —(i)  If a national bank is not required to file an application and obtain prior approval under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the bank need not submit an application. It must submit the notice of capital increase under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The increase in capital is deemed approved by the OCC as of the date the increase was made, once the bank has filed the notice of capital increase and the OCC certifies the increase, as provided in paragraph (i)(3).

      (ii)  In addition to a notice of capital increase under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a national bank must submit an application under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section and obtain prior OCC approval to increase its permanent capital if the bank is:

      (A) Required to receive OCC approval pursuant to letter, order, directive, written agreement, or otherwise;

      (B) Selling common or preferred stock for consideration other than cash; or

      (C) Receiving a material noncash contribution to capital surplus.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, in the case of a sale of preferred stock, the national bank must also submit provisions in the articles of association concerning preferred stock dividends, voting and conversion rights, retirement of the stock, and rights to exercise control over management to the appropriate OCC licensing office prior to the sale of the preferred stock. The provisions will be deemed approved by the OCC within 15 days of its receipt, unless the OCC notifies the filer otherwise, including a statement of the reason for the delay.

      (h)  A national bank must submit an application and obtain prior approval under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section for any reduction of its permanent capital. A national bank may request approval for a reduction in capital for multiple quarters. The request need only specify a total dollar amount for the requested period and need not specify amounts for each quarter.

      (i) —(1)  A national bank proposing to make a change in its permanent capital that requires prior OCC approval under paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The application must:

      (i) Describe the type and amount of the proposed change in permanent capital and explain the reason for the change;

      (ii) In the case of a reduction in capital, provide a schedule detailing the present and proposed capital structure;

      (iii) In the case of a material noncash contribution to capital, provide a description of the method of valuing the contribution; and

      (iv) State if the bank is subject to a capital plan with the OCC and how the proposed change would conform to a capital plan or if a capital plan is otherwise required in connection with the proposed change in permanent capital.

      (2)  An eligible bank's application is deemed approved by the OCC 15 days after the date the OCC receives the application described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2). An eligible bank seeking to decrease its capital may request OCC approval for up to four consecutive quarters. The request need only specify a total dollar amount for the four-quarter period and need not specify amounts for each quarter. An eligible bank may decrease its capital pursuant to such a plan only if the bank maintains its eligible bank status before and after each decrease in its capital.

      (3)  (i) After a bank completes an increase in capital it must submit a notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The notice must be acknowledged before a notary public by the bank's president, vice president, or cashier and contain:

      (A) A description of the transaction, unless already provided pursuant to paragraph (i)(1) of this section;

      (B) The amount, including the par value of the stock, and effective date of the increase;

      (C) A certification that the funds have been paid in, if applicable;

      (D) A certified copy of the amendment to the articles of association, if required; and

      (E) A statement that the bank has complied with all laws, regulations and conditions imposed by the OCC.

      (ii) After it receives the notice of capital increase, the OCC issues a certification specifying the amount of the increase and the effective date ( the date on which the increase occurred). In the case of a capital increase for which prior approval was not required pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i), the increase is deemed certified by the OCC seven days after receipt of the notice if the OCC has not issued a certification prior to that date.

      (4)  A national bank that decreases its capital in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section must notify the appropriate OCC licensing office following the completion of the transaction.

      (5)  Approval expires if a national bank has not completed its change in permanent capital within one year of the date of approval, unless the OCC specifies a longer period.

      (6)  (i) Changes to the permanent capital accounts that result solely from application of GAAP are not subject to the prior approval or notice requirements in paragraph (i)(1), (3), or (4) of this section, as applicable.

      (ii) Within 30 days after the end of the quarter in which the adjustment occurred, a bank must notify the OCC if the accounting adjustment resulted in an increase or decrease to permanent capital in an amount greater than 5% of the bank's total permanent capital prior to the adjustments; or, if the bank is subject to a letter, order, directive, written agreement, or otherwise related to changes in permanent capital. The notification must include the amount and description of the adjustment, including the applicable provision of GAAP.

      (j)  A national bank must comply with the Securities Offering Disclosure Rules in 12 CFR part 16 for offers and sales of common and preferred stock.

      (k)  A national bank must obtain the necessary shareholder approval required by statute for any change in its permanent capital.

      § 5.47   Subordinated debt issued by a national bank.

#### § § 5.47

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 93a, 1831o, and 3907.

      means the stated maturity of the subordinated debt note.

      means principal and interest, and premium, if any.

      means any document pertaining to an issuance of subordinated debt, and any renewal, extension, amendment, modification, or replacement thereof, including the subordinated debt note and any global note, pricing supplement, note agreement, trust indenture, paying agent agreement, or underwriting agreement.

      (iii) Be subordinated to the claims of depositors;

      (v) Be ineligible as collateral for a loan by the issuing national bank;

      (vi) Provide that once any scheduled payments of principal begin, all scheduled payments must be made at least annually and the amount repaid in each year may be no less than in the prior year; and

      (2)  A subordinated debt document must not include any provision or covenant that unduly restricts or otherwise acts to unduly limit the authority of a national bank or interferes with the OCC's supervision of the national bank. Specifically, this would include a provision or covenant that:

      (i) Maintains a certain minimum amount in its capital accounts or other metric, such as minimum capital assets, liquidity, or loan ratios;

      (ii) Unreasonably restricts a national bank's ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional subordinated debt or other regulatory capital instruments;

      (iii) Provides for default and acceleration of the subordinated debt as the result of a change in control, if such change in control results from the OCC's exercise of its statutory authority to require a national bank to sell stock in that national bank, enter into a merger or consolidation, or be acquired by a bank holding company;

      (iv) Requires the prior approval of a purchaser or holder of the subordinated debt note in the case of a voluntary merger by a national bank where the resulting institution:

      (B) Is not in default of the various covenants of the subordinated debt; and

      (v) Provides for default and acceleration of the subordinated debt as the result of a default by a subsidiary (including a limited liability company) of the national bank, unless:

      (B) Such agreement has been reviewed and approved by the OCC.

      (3)  (i) A national bank must disclose clearly on the face of any subordinated debt note the following language in all capital letters:

      (A) THIS OBLIGATION IS NOT A DEPOSIT AND IS NOT INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION; and

      (B) THIS OBLIGATION IS SUBORDINATED TO CLAIMS OF DEPOSITORS AND GENERAL CREDITORS, IS UNSECURED, AND IS INELIGIBLE AS COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN BY [INSERT NAME OF ISSUING NATIONAL BANK].

      (ii) A national bank must disclose clearly and accurately in the subordinated debt note:

      (A) The order and level of subordination, and in addition to being subordinated to the claims of depositors, provide that, at a minimum, the subordinated debt note is subordinate and junior in its right of payment to the obligations of all creditors, including both secured and unsecured or general creditors, except those specifically designated as ranking on a parity with, or subordinated to, the subordinated debt note;

      (B) A general description of the OCC's regulatory authority with respect to a national bank in danger of insolvency that includes:

      () If a national bank that is “undercapitalized” as defined by applicable law fails to satisfactorily implement a required capital restoration plan, the national bank may be subject to all the additional restrictions and requirements applicable to a “significantly undercapitalized” institution, as defined by applicable law, including being required to sell shares in the national bank, being acquired by a depository institution holding company, or being merged or consolidated with another depository institution, and this authority supersedes and voids any defaults that may have occurred; and

      () If a national bank is “critically undercapitalized,” as defined by applicable law, the national bank is prohibited from making principal or interest payments on the subordinated debt note without prior regulatory approval; and

      (C) A description of the OCC's authority under 12 CFR 3.11 to limit distributions, including interest payments on any tier 2 capital instrument if the national bank has full discretion to permanently or temporarily suspend such payments without triggering an event of default, if applicable to the subordinated debt issuance.

      (D) A statement that the obligation may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the national bank enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

      (iii) A national bank must comply with the Securities Offering Disclosure Rules in 12 CFR part 16.

      (e)  In order to qualify as tier 2 capital, a national bank's subordinated debt must meet the requirements in 12 CFR 3.20(d).

      (f) —(1) —(i) —(A)  An eligible bank is required to receive prior approval from the OCC to issue any subordinated debt, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, if:

      () The OCC has previously notified the national bank that prior approval is required; or

      () Prior approval is required by law.

      (B)  A national bank that is not an eligible bank must receive prior OCC approval to issue any subordinated debt, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.

      (ii)  A national bank that intends to include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital must submit an application to the OCC for approval, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, before or within ten days after issuing the subordinated debt. Where a national bank's application to issue subordinated debt has been deemed to be approved, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, and the national bank does not contemporaneously receive approval from the OCC to include the subordinated debt as tier 2 capital, the national bank must submit an application for approval to include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital, pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, after issuance of the subordinated debt. A national bank may not include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital unless the national bank has filed the application with the OCC and received approval from the OCC that the subordinated debt issued by the national bank qualifies as tier 2 capital.

      (2) —(i) —(A)  An eligible bank is required to receive prior approval from the OCC to prepay any subordinated debt that is not included in tier 2 capital (including acceleration, repurchase, redemption prior to maturity, and exercising a call option), in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, only if:

      () The national bank will not be an eligible bank after the transaction;

      () The OCC has previously notified the national bank that prior approval is required;

      () Prior approval is required by law; or

      () The amount of the proposed prepayment is equal to or greater than one percent of the national bank's total capital, as defined in 12 CFR 3.2.

      (ii)  All national banks must receive prior OCC approval to prepay subordinated debt included in tier 2 capital, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (3)  A national bank must receive prior approval from the OCC in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section prior to making a material change to an existing subordinated debt document if the bank would have been required to receive OCC approval to issue the security under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section or to include it in tier 2 capital under paragraph (h) of this section.

      (g) —(1) —(i)  A national bank required to obtain OCC approval before issuing subordinated debt must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The application must include:

      (D) Either:

      () A statement explaining why the national bank believes that following the proposed prepayment the national bank would continue to hold an amount of capital commensurate with its risk; or

      () A description of the replacement capital instrument that meets the criteria for tier 1 or tier _2_ capital under 12 CFR 3.20, including the amount of such instrument, and the time frame for issuance.

      (iii)  A national bank required to obtain OCC approval before making a material change to an existing subordinated debt document, pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The application must include:

      (A) A description of all proposed changes;

      (B) A statement of whether the national bank is subject to a capital plan or required to file a capital plan with the OCC and, if so, how the proposed change conforms to the capital plan;

      (C) A copy of the revised subordinated debt documents reflecting all proposed changes; and

      (D) A statement that the proposed changes to the subordinated debt documents complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

      (iv)  The OCC reserves the right to request additional relevant information, as appropriate.

      (2) —(i)  The application is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the national bank prior to that date that the filing presents a significant supervisory or compliance concern or raises a significant legal or policy issue.

      (ii)  Notwithstanding this paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, if the application for prior approval is for prepayment, the national bank must receive affirmative approval from the OCC. If the OCC requires the national bank to replace the subordinated debt, the national bank must receive affirmative approval that the replacement capital instrument meets the criteria for tier 1 or tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20 and must issue the replacement instrument prior to prepaying the subordinated debt, or immediately thereafter.

      (iii)  Following notification to the OCC pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section that the national bank has issued the subordinated debt, the OCC will notify the national bank whether the subordinated debt qualifies as tier 2 capital.

      (iv)  Approval expires if a national bank does not complete the sale of the subordinated debt within one year of approval.

      (h)  (1) A national bank must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office in writing before or within ten days after issuing subordinated debt that it intends to include in tier 2 capital. A national bank may not include such subordinated debt in tier 2 capital unless the national bank has received approval from the OCC that the subordinated debt qualifies as tier 2 capital.

      (2) The application must include:

      (i) The terms of the issuance;

      (ii) The amount or projected amount and date or projected date of receipt of funds;

      (iii) The interest rate or expected calculation method for the interest rate;

      (i)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to transactions governed by this section.

      (j)  A provision or covenant included in a subordinated debt document does not unduly restrict or otherwise act to unduly limit the authority of a national bank or interfere with the OCC's supervision of the national bank, for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if the provision or covenant is included pursuant to requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the subordinated debt is issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Emergency Capital Investment Program pursuant to section 104A of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

      (b)  A national bank or a Federal savings association considering going into voluntary liquidation must provide preliminary notice to the OCC. The bank or savings association must also file a notice with the OCC once a liquidation plan is definite. The bank or savings association may not begin liquidation unless the OCC has notified it that the OCC does not object to the liquidation plan.

      (c)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to a voluntary liquidation. However, if the OCC concludes that the notice presents significant or novel policy, supervisory or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (d) —(1)  In reviewing a proposed liquidation plan, the OCC will consider:

      (iii) Its impact on the bank's or savings association's depositors, other creditors, and customers.

      (2)  For national banks, the OCC also will review liquidation plans for compliance with 12 U.S.C. 181 and 182.

      (3)  For Federal mutual savings associations, the OCC also will assess the advisability of, and alternatives to, liquidation and the effect of liquidation on all concerned.

      (e) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is considering going into voluntary liquidation must provide preliminary notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office.

      (2)  (i) After a national bank or Federal savings association provides preliminary notice under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the bank or savings association plans to proceed with liquidation, it must submit a voluntary liquidation plan to the OCC. A liquidation plan may be effected in whole or part through purchase and assumption transactions.

      (ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must receive the OCC's non-objection to the liquidation plan before beginning the liquidation.

      (B) provide notice to depositors, other known creditors, and known claimants of the bank or savings association.

      (ii)  A vote to liquidate a national bank must comply with 12 U.S.C. 181. In addition, a national bank must publish notice in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 182.

      (4)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidating agent or committee must submit a report to the appropriate OCC licensing office at the start of liquidation showing the bank's or savings association's balance sheet as of the start of liquidation.

      (5)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidating agent or committee must submit a “Report of Progress of Liquidation” annually to the appropriate OCC licensing office until the liquidation is complete.

      (6)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidating agent or committee must submit a final report at the conclusion of liquidation showing that all creditors have been satisfied, remaining assets have been distributed to shareholders, resolutions to dissolve the bank or savings association have been adopted, and the bank or savings association has been dissolved. The national bank or Federal savings association also must return its charter certificate to the OCC.

      (f) —(1)  When an acquiring depository institution in a business combination purchases all the assets, and assumes all the liabilities, including all contingent liabilities, of a target national bank or Federal savings association, the target national bank or Federal savings association may be dissolved immediately after the combination. However, if any liabilities will remain in the target national bank or Federal savings association, then the standard liquidation procedures apply. This paragraph (f) does not apply to dissolutions of Federal mutual savings associations, which are subject to the standard liquidation procedures.

      (2)  After its board of directors and shareholders have voted to liquidate and the national bank or Federal savings association has notified the appropriate OCC licensing office of its plans, the bank or savings association may surrender its charter and dissolve immediately, if:

      (i) The acquiring depository institution certifies to the OCC that it has purchased all the assets and assumed all the liabilities, including all contingent liabilities, of the national bank or Federal savings association in liquidation; and

      (ii) The acquiring depository institution and the national bank or Federal savings association in liquidation have published notice that the bank or savings association will dissolve after the purchase and assumption to the acquiror. This notice must be included in the notice and publication for the purchase and assumption required under the Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(c).

      (B) Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, would be presumed to have controlled that bank or Federal savings association continuously since March 9, 1979, if the transaction will not result in that person's direct or indirect ownership or power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the national bank or Federal savings association; or, in other cases, where the OCC determines that the person has controlled the bank or savings association continuously since March 9, 1979;

However, preferred stock or similar interests are not voting securities if:

      (A) Any voting rights associated with the shares or interests are limited solely to voting rights customarily provided by statute regarding matters that would significantly affect the rights or preference of the security or other interest. This includes the issuance of additional amounts of classes of senior securities, the modification of the terms of the security or interest, the dissolution of the issuing national bank, or the payment of dividends by the issuing national bank or Federal savings association when preferred dividends are in arrears;

      (B) The shares or interests are a passive investment or financing device and do not otherwise provide the holder with control over the issuing national bank or Federal savings association; and

      (C) The shares or interests do not allow the holder by statute, charter, or in any manner, to select or to vote for the selection of directors (or persons exercising similar functions) of the issuing national bank or Federal savings association.

      (ii) Securities, other instruments, or similar interests that are immediately convertible, at the option of the owner or holder thereof, into voting securities.

      (e) —(1)  The OCC seeks to enhance and maintain public confidence in the banking system by preventing a change in control of a national bank or Federal savings association that could have serious adverse effects on a national bank's or Federal savings association's financial stability or management resources, the interests of the bank's or Federal savings association's customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or competition.

      (2)  (i) If corporations, partnerships, certain trusts, associations, and similar organizations, that are not already bank holding companies, are not required to secure prior Federal Reserve Board approval to acquire control of a bank under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1842, other than indirectly through the acquisition of shares of a bank holding company, they are subject to the notice requirements of this section.

      (ii) Certain transactions, including foreclosures by depository institutions and other institutional lenders, fiduciary acquisitions by depository institutions, and increases of majority holdings by bank holding companies, are described in sections 2(a)(5)(D) and 3(a) (A) and (B) of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(5)(D) and 12 U.S.C. 1842(a) (A) and (B), but do not require the Federal Reserve Board's prior approval. For purposes of this section, they are considered subject to section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1842, and do not require either a prior or subsequent notice to the OCC under this section.

      (3)  In assessing the financial condition of the acquiring person, the OCC weighs any debt servicing requirements in light of the acquiring person's overall financial strength; the institution's earnings performance, asset condition, capital adequacy, and future prospects; and the likelihood of the acquiring party making unreasonable demands on the resources of the institution.

      (f) —(1)  Sections 5.8(a), 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, and 5.13(a) through (f) do not apply to filings under this section. When complying with § 5.8(b) no address is required for a notice filed by one or more individuals under this section.

      (ii) The following persons are presumed to be acting in concert for purposes of this section:

      (A) A company and any controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such company if both the company and the person own stock in the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (B) A person and the members of the person's immediate family;

      (C) Companies under common control;

      (D) Persons that have made, or propose to make, a joint filing under section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78m or 78n, and the rules thereunder promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission;

      (E) A person or company will be presumed to be acting in concert with any trust for which such person or company serves as trustee, except that a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in 12 CFR 192.25 is not be presumed to be acting in concert with its trustee or person acting in a similar fiduciary capacity solely for the purposes of determining whether to combine the holdings of a plan and its trustee or fiduciary; and

      (F) Persons that are parties to any agreement, contract, understanding, relationship, or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise, regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association, other than through a revocable proxy in connection with a proxy solicitation for the purposes of conducting business at a regular or special meeting of the institution, if the proxy terminates within a reasonable period after the meeting.

      (iii) The OCC presumes, unless rebutted, that an acquisition or other disposition of voting securities through which any person proposes to acquire ownership of, or the power to vote, 10 percent or more of a class of voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association is an acquisition by a person of the power to direct the bank's or savings association's management or policies if:

      (A) The securities to be acquired or voted are subject to the registration requirements of section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78; or

      (B) Immediately after the transaction no other person will own or have the power to vote a greater proportion of that class of voting securities.

      (iv) The OCC will consider a rebuttal of the presumption of control where the person or company intends to have no more than one representative on the board of directors of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (v) The presumption of control may not be rebutted if the total equity investment by the person or company in the national bank or Federal savings association, including 15 percent or more of any class of voting securities, equals or exceeds one third of the total equity of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (vi) Other transactions resulting in a person's control of less than 25 percent of a class of voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association are not deemed by the OCC to result in control for purposes of this section.

      (vii) If two or more persons, not acting in concert, each propose to acquire simultaneously equal percentages of 10 percent or more of a class of a national bank's or Federal savings association's voting securities, and either the acquisitions are of a class of securities subject to the registration requirements of section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78l, or immediately after the transaction no other shareholder of the national bank or Federal savings association would own or have the power to vote a greater percentage of the class, each of the acquiring persons must either file a notice or rebut the presumption of control.

      (viii) An acquiring person may seek to rebut a presumption established in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section by presenting relevant information in writing to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The OCC will respond in writing to any person that seeks to rebut the presumption of control or the presumption of concerted action. No rebuttal filing is effective unless the OCC indicates in writing that the information submitted has been found to be sufficient to rebut the presumption of control.

      (3)  (i) The OCC does not accept a notice of a change in control unless it is technically complete,  the information provided is responsive to every item listed in the notice form and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.

      (A) The notice must contain the information required under 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(6)(A), and the information prescribed in the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report. This form is available at . The OCC may waive any of the informational requirements of the notice if the OCC determines that it is in the public interest.

      (B) When the acquiring person is an individual, or group of individuals acting in concert, the requirement to provide personal financial data may be satisfied with a current statement of assets and liabilities and an income summary, together with a statement of any material changes since the date of the statement or summary. However, the OCC may require additional information, if appropriate.

      (ii) The OCC has 60 days from the date it declares the notice to be technically complete to review the notice.

      (A) When the OCC declares a notice technically complete, the appropriate OCC licensing office sends a letter of acknowledgment to the filer indicating the technically complete date.

      (B) As set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, the filer must publish an announcement within 10 days of filing the notice with the OCC. The publication of the announcement triggers a 20-day public comment period. The OCC may waive or shorten the public comment period if an emergency exists. The OCC also may shorten the comment period for other good cause. The OCC may act on a proposed change in control prior to the expiration of the public comment period if the OCC makes a written determination that an emergency exists.

      (C) A filer must notify the OCC immediately of any material changes in a notice submitted to the OCC, including changes in financial or other conditions that may affect the OCC's decision on the filing.

      (iii) Within the 60-day period, the OCC may inform the filer that the acquisition has been disapproved, has not been disapproved, or that the OCC will extend the 60-day review period for up to an additional 30 days. The period or the OCC's review of a notice may be further extended not to exceed two additional times for not more than 45 days each time if:

      (A) The OCC determines that any acquiring party has not furnished all the information required under this part;

      (B) In the OCC's judgment, any material information submitted is substantially inaccurate;

      (C) The OCC has been unable to complete an investigation of each acquirer because of any delay caused by, or the inadequate cooperation of, such acquirer; or

      (D) The OCC determines that additional time is needed to investigate and determine that no acquiring party has a record of failing to comply with the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31 of the United States Code.

      (4)  The OCC may impose conditions on its action not to disapprove a notice to assure satisfaction of the relevant statutory criteria for non-objection to a notice.

      (5)  The OCC may disapprove a notice if it finds that any of the following factors exist:

      (i) The proposed acquisition of control would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States;

      (ii) The effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly or the proposed acquisition of control would in any other manner be in restraint of trade, and the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;

      (iii) Either the financial condition of any acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or Federal savings association or prejudice the interests of the depositors of the bank or Federal savings association;

      (iv) The competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring person, or of any of the proposed management personnel, indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the bank or Federal savings association, or in the interest of the public, to permit that person to control the bank or Federal savings association;

      (v) An acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the OCC all the information it requires; or

      (vi) The OCC determines that the proposed transaction would result in an adverse effect on the Deposit Insurance Fund.

      (6) —(i)  If the OCC disapproves a notice, it will notify the filer in writing within three days after the decision. The OCC's written disapproval will contain a statement of the basis for disapproval and indicate that the filer may request a hearing.

      (ii)  The filer may request a hearing by the OCC within 10 days of receipt of disapproval, pursuant to the procedures in 12 CFR part 19, subpart H. Following final agency action under 12 CFR part 19, further review by the courts is available. ( 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(5)).

      (iii)  If a filer fails to request a hearing with a timely request, the notice of disapproval constitutes a final and unappealable order.

      (g) —(1)  The filer must publish an announcement in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the affected national bank or Federal savings association is located within 10 days of filing. The OCC may authorize a delayed announcement if an immediate announcement would not be in the public interest.

      (i) In addition to the information required by § 5.8(b), the announcement must include the name of the national bank or Federal savings association named in the notice and the comment period ( 20 days from the date of the announcement). The announcement also must state that the public portion of the notice is available upon request.

      (ii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph (g), if the OCC determines in writing that an emergency exists and that the announcement requirements of this paragraph (g) would seriously threaten the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association to be acquired, including situations where the OCC must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC may waive or shorten the publication requirement.

      (2)  (i) Upon the request of any person, the OCC releases the information provided in the public portion of the notice and makes it available for public inspection and copying as soon as possible after a notice has been filed. In certain circumstances the OCC may determine that the release of the information would not be in the public interest. In addition, the OCC makes the date that the notice is filed, the disposition of the notice and the date thereof, and the consummation date of the transaction, if applicable, publicly available in the OCC's “Weekly Bulletin.”

      (ii) The OCC handles requests for the non-public portion of the notice as requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and other applicable law.

      (h)  After the consummation of the change in control, the national bank or Federal savings association must notify the OCC in writing of any changes or replacements of its chief executive officer or of any director occurring during the 12-month period beginning on the date of consummation. This notice must be filed within 10 days of such change or replacement and must include a statement of the past and current business and professional affiliations of the new chief executive officers or directors.

      (i) —(1)  (i) Any foreign bank, or any affiliate thereof, must file a consolidated report with the appropriate OCC supervisory office of the national bank or Federal savings association if the foreign bank or any affiliate thereof, has credit outstanding to any person or group of persons that, in the aggregate, is secured, directly or indirectly, by 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the same national bank or Federal savings association.

      (ii) The foreign bank, or any affiliate thereof, must also file a copy of the report with its appropriate OCC supervisory office if that office is different from the national bank's or Federal savings association's appropriate OCC supervisory office. If the foreign bank, or any affiliate thereof, is not supervised by the OCC, it must file a copy of the report filed with the OCC with its appropriate Federal banking agency.

      (iii) Any shares of the national bank or Federal savings association held by the foreign bank, or any affiliate thereof, as principal must be included in the calculation of the number of shares in which the foreign bank or any affiliate thereof has a security interest for purposes of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section.

      (A) Are acting together, in concert, or with one another to acquire or control shares of the same insured national bank or Federal savings association, including an acquisition of shares of the same national bank or Federal savings association at approximately the same time under substantially the same terms; or

      (B) Have made, or propose to make, a joint filing under 15 U.S.C. 78m regarding ownership of the shares of the same depository institution.

      (i) The person or group of persons referred to in paragraph (i)(1) of this section has disclosed the amount borrowed and the security interest therein to the appropriate OCC licensing office in connection with a notice filed under this section or any other application filed with the appropriate OCC licensing office as a substitute for a notice under this section, such as for a national bank or Federal savings association charter; or

      (ii) The transaction involves a person or group of persons that has been the owner or owners of record of the stock for a period of one year or more or, if the transaction involves stock issued by a newly chartered bank or Federal savings association, before the bank's or Federal savings association's opening.

      (4)  (i) The consolidated report must indicate the number and percentage of shares securing each applicable extension of credit, the identity of the borrower, and the number of shares held as principal by the foreign bank and any affiliate thereof.

      (3)  (i) Following receipt of a technically complete notice, the OCC may request additional information. Such request must be in writing, must explain why the information is needed, and must specify a time period during which the information must be provided.

      (ii) If the national bank or Federal savings association cannot provide the information requested by the OCC within the time specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may request in writing that the OCC suspend processing of the notice. The OCC will advise the national bank or Federal savings association in writing whether the suspension request is granted and, if granted, the length of the suspension.

      (iii) If the national bank or Federal savings association fails to provide the requested information within the time specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, the OCC may deem the filing abandoned under § 5.13(c) or may review the notice based on the information provided.

      (4)  The OCC may disapprove an individual proposed as a member of the board of directors or as a senior executive officer if the OCC determines on the basis of the individual's competence, experience, character, or integrity that it would not be in the best interests of the depositors of the national bank or Federal savings association or the public to permit the individual to be employed by, or associated with, the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC must send a written notice of disapproval to both the national bank or Federal savings association and the individual stating the basis for disapproval.

      (5)  An individual proposed as a member of the board of directors or as a senior executive officer may begin service before the expiration of the review period if the OCC notifies the individual and the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that the OCC does not disapprove the proposed director or senior executive officer and all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied.

      (6) —(i)  (A) A national bank or Federal savings association may send a letter to the appropriate supervisory office requesting a waiver of the prior notice requirement.

      (B) The OCC may grant the waiver if it issues a written finding that:

      () Delay could adversely affect the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association;

      () Delay would not be in the public interest; or

      () Other extraordinary circumstances justify waiver of prior notice.

      (C) The OCC will determine the length of the waiver on a case-by-case basis. All waivers that the OCC grants under this paragraph (e)(6) are subject to the condition that the national bank or Federal savings association must file a technically complete notice under this section within the time period specified by the OCC.

      (D) Subject to paragraph (e)(6)(i)(C) of this section, the proposed individual may assume the position on an interim basis until the earliest of the following events:

      () The individual and the national bank or the Federal savings association receive a notice of intent not to disapprove, at which time the individual may assume the position on a permanent basis, provided all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied;

      () The individual and the national bank or the Federal savings association receive a notice of disapproval within 90 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice. In this event the individual must immediately resign from the position upon receipt of the notice of disapproval and may assume the position on a permanent basis only if the notice of disapproval is reversed on appeal and all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied; or

      () The OCC does not act within 90 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice. In this event, the individual may assume the position on a permanent basis 91 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice.

      (E) If the technically complete notice is not filed within the time period specified in the waiver, the proposed individual must immediately resign their position. Thereafter, the individual may assume the position only after a technically complete notice has been filed, all other applicable requirements are satisfied, and:

      () The national bank or the Federal savings association receives a notice of intent not to disapprove;

      () The review period expires; or

      () A notice of disapproval has been overturned on appeal as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (F) Notwithstanding the grant of a waiver, the OCC has authority to issue a notice of disapproval within 30 days of the expiration of such waiver.

      (ii)  An individual who has been elected to the board of directors of a national bank or Federal savings association may serve as a director on an interim basis before a notice has been filed under this section, provided the individual was not nominated by management, and the national bank or Federal savings association submits a notice under this section not later than seven days after the individual has been notified of the election. The individual may serve on an interim basis until the occurrence of the earliest of the events described in paragraphs (e)(6)(i)(D)(), (), or () of this section.

      (7)  An individual proposed as a member of the board of directors or as a senior executive officer who satisfies all other applicable legal requirements may assume the office on a permanent basis:

      (i) Prior to the expiration of the review period, only if the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that the OCC does not disapprove the proposed director or senior executive officer pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section; or

      (ii) Following the expiration of the review period, unless:

      (A) The OCC issues a written notice of disapproval during the review period; or

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association does not provide additional information within the time period required by the OCC pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section and the OCC deems the notice to be abandoned pursuant to § 5.13(c).

      (8)  Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, and 5.13(a) through (f) do not apply to a notice for a change in directors and senior executive officers, except that § 5.13(c) will apply to the extent provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (e)(7) of this section.

      (f)  (1) If the national bank or Federal savings association, the proposed individual, or both, disagree with a disapproval, they may seek review by appealing the disapproval to the Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, within 15 days of the receipt of the notice of disapproval. The national bank or Federal savings association or the individual may appeal on the grounds that the reasons for disapproval are contrary to fact or insufficient to justify disapproval. The appellant must submit all documents and written arguments that the appellant wishes to be considered in support of the appeal.

      (2) The Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, may designate an appellate official who was not previously involved in the decision leading to the appeal at issue. The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official considers all information submitted with the original notice, the material before the OCC official who made the initial decision, and any information submitted by the appellant at the time of the appeal.

      (3) The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will independently determine whether the reasons given for the disapproval are contrary to fact or insufficient to justify the disapproval. If either is determined to be the case, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official may reverse the disapproval.

      (4) Upon completion of the review, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will notify the appellant in writing of the decision. If the original decision is reversed, the individual may assume the position in the national bank or Federal savings association for which he or she was proposed.

      (b)  This section requires a national bank or a Federal savings association to obtain the approval of the OCC for a substantial asset change.

      (c) —(1)  Except as provide in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  means:

      (i) The sale or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the national bank's or Federal savings association's assets in a transaction or a series of transactions;

      (v) Any change in the purpose of the charter of the national bank or Federal savings association as described in § 5.20(l)(2).

      (2)  The term “substantial asset change” does not include, and this section does not apply, to a change in composition of all, or substantially all, of a bank's or savings association's assets:

      (i) That the bank or savings association undertakes in response to direction from the OCC ( in an enforcement action pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818);

      (ii) That is part of a voluntary liquidation under § 5.48, if the bank or savings association in liquidation has obtained the OCC's non-objection to its plan of liquidation under § 5.48 and has stipulated in its notice of liquidation to the OCC that its liquidation will be completed, the bank or savings association dissolved and its charter returned to the OCC within one year of the date it filed the notice of liquidation, unless the OCC extends the time period;

      (iii) That occurs as a result of a bank's or savings association's ordinary and ongoing business of originating and securitizing loans; or

In determining whether to require an application, the OCC considers the size and nature of the transaction and the condition of the institutions involved.

      (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must file an application and obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before engaging in a substantial asset change.

      (3) —(i)  (A) In determining whether to approve an application filed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the OCC considers the following factors:

      () The capital level of any resulting national bank or Federal savings association;

      () The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies;

      () The purpose of the transaction;

      () The impact of the transaction on safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association; and

      () The effect of the transaction on the national bank or Federal savings association's shareholders, depositors, other creditors, and customers.

      (B) The OCC may deny the application if the transaction would have a negative effect in any of these respects.

      (ii)  The OCC's review of any substantial asset change that involves the purchase or other acquisition or other expansions of the bank's or savings association's operations or that involves a change in the purpose of the bank's or association's charter, as described in § 5.20(l)(2), will include, in addition to the foregoing factors, the factors governing the organization of a bank or savings association under § 5.20.

      (e)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply with respect to applications filed pursuant to this section.

      § 5.55   Capital distributions by Federal savings associations.

#### § § 5.55

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1467a, 1831o, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  A Federal savings association must file an application before making a capital distribution, as provided in this section.

      (c)  This section applies to all capital distributions by a Federal savings association and sets forth the procedures and standards relating to a capital distribution.

      (d)  The following definitions apply to this section:

      (1)  means an affiliate, as defined under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regarding transactions with affiliates, 12 CFR part 223 (Regulation W).

      (2)  means:

      (i) A distribution of cash or other property to owners of a Federal savings association made on account of their ownership, but excludes:

      (A) Any dividend consisting only of the shares of the savings association or rights to purchase the shares; or

      (B) If the savings association is a Federal mutual savings association, any payment that the savings association is required to make under the terms of a deposit instrument and any other amount paid on deposits that the OCC determines is not a distribution for the purposes of this section;

      (ii) A Federal savings association's payment to repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any of its shares or other ownership interests; any payment to repurchase, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire debt instruments included in its total capital under 12 CFR part 3; and any extension of credit to finance an affiliate's acquisition of the savings association's shares or interests;

      (iii) Any direct or indirect payment of cash or other property to owners or affiliates made in connection with a corporate restructuring. This includes the Federal savings association's payment of cash or property to shareholders of another association or to shareholders of its holding company to acquire ownership in that association, other than by a distribution of shares;

      (iv) Any other distribution charged against a Federal savings association's capital accounts if the savings association would not be well capitalized, as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, following the distribution; and

      (v) Any transaction that the OCC determines, by order or regulation, to be in substance a distribution of capital.

      (3)  has the same meaning as in section 10(a)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(a)(2)).

      (4)  means a Federal savings association's net income computed in accordance with GAAP.

      (5)  means a Federal savings association's net income for a specified period less total capital distributions declared in that period.

      (6)  means common and preferred stock, and any options, warrants, or other rights for the acquisition of such stock. The term “share” also includes convertible securities upon their conversion into common or preferred stock. The term does not include convertible debt securities prior to their conversion into common or preferred stock or other securities that are not equity securities at the time of a capital distribution.

      (e) —(1)  A Federal savings association must file an application with the OCC before making a capital distribution if:

      (i) The Federal savings association would not be at least well capitalized or would not otherwise remain an eligible savings association following the distribution;

      (ii) The total amount of all of the Federal savings association's capital distributions (including the proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years. If the capital distribution is from retained earnings, the aggregate limitation in this paragraph may be calculated in accordance with § 5.64(c)(2), substituting “capital distributions” for “dividends” in that section;

      (iii) The Federal savings association's proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or debentures included in capital under 12 CFR part 3 (other than regular payments required under a debt instrument approved under § 5.56);

      (iv) The Federal savings association's proposed capital distribution is payable in property other than cash;

      (v) The Federal savings association is directly or indirectly controlled by a mutual savings and loan holding company or by a company that is not a savings and loan holding company; or

      (vi) The Federal savings association's proposed capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute, regulation, or agreement between the Federal savings association and the OCC or the OTS, or violate a condition imposed on the Federal savings association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS.

      (2)  A Federal savings association may make a capital distribution without filing an application with the OCC if it does not meet the filing requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (3)  If the Federal savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company that is filing a notice with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) for a dividend solely under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(f) and not also under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o)(11), and no application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is required, then the savings association must provide an informational copy to the OCC of the notice filed with the Board, at the same time the notice is filed with the Board.

      (f) —(1)  The application must:

      (i) Be in narrative form;

      (ii) Include all relevant information concerning the proposed capital distribution, including the amount, timing, and type of distribution; and

      (iii) Demonstrate compliance with paragraph (h) of this section.

      (2)  The application may include a schedule proposing capital distributions over a specified period.

      (3)  A Federal savings association may combine the application required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section with any other notice or application, if the capital distribution is a part of, or is proposed in connection with, another transaction requiring a notice or application under this chapter. If submitting a combined filing, the Federal savings association must state that the related notice or application is intended to serve as an application under this section.

      (g) —(1)  When a Federal savings association is required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, it must file the application at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of directors. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the OCC is deemed to have approved an application from an eligible savings association upon the expiration of 30 days after the filing date of the application unless, before the expiration of that time period, the OCC notifies the Federal savings association that:

      (i) Additional information is required to supplement the application;

      (ii) The application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under 5.13(a)(2); or

      (iii) The application is denied.

      (2)  An application is not subject to expedited review if:

      (i) The Federal savings association is not an eligible savings association;

      (ii) The total amount of all of the Federal savings association's capital distributions (including the proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years;

      (iii) The Federal savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized, as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, following the distribution; or

      (iv) The Federal savings association's proposed capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute, regulation, or agreement between the savings association and the OCC or the OTS, or violate a condition imposed on the savings association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS.

      (3) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, a Federal savings association that is required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or an informational copy of a notice under paragraph (e)(3) of this section must submit the application or notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office.

      (ii)  A Federal savings association that is required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section for capital distributions involving solely a cash dividend from retained earnings or involving a cash dividend from retained earnings and a concurrent cash distribution from permanent capital must submit the application to the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

      (h)  After review of an application submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section:

      (1) The OCC may deny the application in whole or in part, if it makes any of the following determinations:

      (i) The Federal savings association will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, as applicable, following the capital distribution. If so, the OCC will determine if the capital distribution is permitted under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(d)(1)(B).

      (ii) The proposed capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns.

      (iii) The proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, agreement between the Federal savings association and the OCC or the OTS, or a condition imposed on the Federal savings association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS.

      (2) The OCC may approve the application in whole or in part. Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, the OCC may waive any waivable prohibition or condition to permit a distribution.

      (i)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to capital distributions made by Federal savings associations.

      § 5.56   Inclusion of subordinated debt securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as Federal savings association supplementary (tier 2) capital.

#### § § 5.56

      (a)  (1) A Federal savings association must comply with this section in order to include subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (“covered securities”) in tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20(d) and to prepay covered securities included in tier 2 capital. A savings association that does not include covered securities in tier 2 capital is not required to comply with this section. Covered securities not included in tier 2 capital are subject to the requirements of § 163.80 of this chapter.

      (2) For purposes of this section, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock means mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that was issued before July 23, 1985 or issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and approved in writing by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for inclusion as regulatory capital before or after issuance.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  A Federal savings association must file an application seeking the OCC's approval of the inclusion of covered securities in tier 2 capital. The savings association may file its application before or after it issues covered securities, but may not include covered securities in tier 2 capital until the OCC approves the application and the securities are issued.

      (ii)  The OCC is deemed to have approved an application from an eligible savings association to include covered securities in tier 2 capital upon the expiration of 30 days after the filing date of the application unless, before the expiration of that time period, the OCC notifies the Federal savings association that:

      (A) Additional information is required to supplement the application;

      (B) The application has been removed from expedited review or the expedited review process is extended under § 5.13(a)(2); or

      (C) The OCC denies the application.

      (iii)  A Federal savings association also must comply with the securities offering rules at 12 CFR part 16 by filing an offering circular for a proposed issuance of covered securities, unless the offering qualifies for an exemption under that part.

      (2) —(i)  A Federal savings association must file an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC before prepaying covered securities included in tier 2 capital. The application must include:

      (A) A statement explaining why the Federal savings association believes that following the proposed prepayment the savings association would continue to hold an amount of capital commensurate with its risk; or

      (B) A description of the replacement capital instrument that meets the criteria for tier 1 or tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20, including the amount of such instrument and the time frame for issuance.

      (ii)  If the OCC conditions approval of prepayment on a requirement that a Federal savings association must replace the covered security with a covered security of an equivalent amount that satisfies the requirements for tier 1 or tier 2 capital, the savings association must file an application to issue the replacement covered security and must receive prior OCC approval.

      (c)  A covered security issued under this section must satisfy the requirements for tier 2 capital in 12 CFR 3.20(d).

      (d)  To be included in tier 2 capital, covered securities must satisfy the requirements in 12 CFR 3.20(d). In addition, such covered securities must meet the following requirements:

      (1)  (i) Each certificate evidencing a covered security must:

      (A) Bear the following legend on its face, in bold type: “This security is  a savings account or deposit and it is  insured by the United States or any agency or fund of the United States;”

      (B) State that the security is subordinated on liquidation, as to principal, interest, and premium, to all claims against the savings association that have the same priority as savings accounts or a higher priority;

      (C) State that the security is not secured by the savings association's assets or the assets of any affiliate of the savings association. An affiliate means any person or company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the savings association;

      (D) State that the security is not eligible collateral for a loan by the savings association;

      (E) State the prohibition on the payment of dividends or interest at 12 U.S.C. 1828(b) and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, state the prohibition on the payment of principal and interest at 12 U.S.C. 1831o(h), 12 CFR 3.11, and any other relevant restrictions;

      (F) For subordinated debt securities, state or refer to a document stating the terms under which the savings association may prepay the obligation;

      (G) Where applicable, state or refer to a document stating that the savings association must obtain OCC's prior approval before the acceleration of payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt securities, redemption of subordinated debt securities prior to maturity, repurchase of subordinated debt securities, or exercising a call option in connection with a subordinated debt security; and

      (H) State that the security may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the savings association enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

      (ii) A Federal savings association must include such additional statements as the OCC may prescribe for certificates, purchase agreements, indentures, and other related documents.

      (2)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a Federal savings association must use an indenture for subordinated debt securities. If the aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities publicly offered (excluding sales in a non-public offering as defined in 12 CFR 16.7) and sold in any consecutive 12-month or 36-month period exceeds $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 respectively (or such lesser amount that the Securities and Exchange Commission may establish by rule or regulation under 15 U.S.C. 77ddd), the indenture must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than the savings association or an affiliate of the savings association (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section) and for collective enforcement of the security holders' rights and remedies.

      (ii) A Federal savings association is not required to use an indenture if the subordinated debt securities are sold only to accredited investors, as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15). A savings association must have an indenture that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section in place before any debt securities for which an exemption from the indenture requirement is claimed, are transferred to any non-accredited investor. If a savings association relies on this exemption from the indenture requirement, it must place a legend on the debt securities indicating that an indenture must be in place before the debt securities are transferred to any non-accredited investor.

      (e)  (1) In reviewing applications under this section, the OCC will consider whether:

      (i) The issuance of the covered securities is authorized under applicable laws and regulations and is consistent with the savings association's charter and bylaws;

      (ii) The savings association is at least adequately capitalized under 12 CFR 6.4 and meets the regulatory capital requirements at 12 CFR 3.10;

      (iii) The savings association is or will be able to service the covered securities;

      (iv) The covered securities are consistent with the requirements of this section;

      (v) The covered securities and related transactions sufficiently transfer risk from the Deposit Insurance Fund; and

      (vi) The OCC has no objection to the issuance based on the savings association's overall policies, condition, and operations.

      (2) The OCC's approval is conditioned upon no material changes to the information disclosed in the application submitted to the OCC. The OCC may impose such additional requirements or conditions as it may deem necessary to protect purchasers, the savings association, the OCC, or the Deposit Insurance Fund.

      (f)  If a Federal savings association amends the covered securities or related documents following the completion of the OCC's review, it must obtain the OCC's approval under this section before it may include the amended securities in tier 2 capital.

      (g)  The Federal savings association must complete the sale of covered securities within one year after the OCC's approval under this section. A savings association may request an extension of the offering period by filing a written request with the OCC. The savings association must demonstrate good cause for the extension and file the request at least 30 days before the expiration of the offering period or any extension of the offering period.

      (h)  The OCC may require a Federal savings association seeking prior approval to prepay a covered security included in tier 2 capital to issue a replacement covered security of an equivalent amount that qualifies as tier 1 or tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20. If the OCC imposes such a requirement, the savings association must complete the sale of such covered security prior to, or immediately after, the prepayment.

      (i)  A Federal savings association must file the following information with the OCC within 30 days after the savings association completes the sale of covered securities includable as tier 2 capital. If the savings association filed its application following the completion of the sale, it must submit this information with its application:

      (1) A written report indicating the number of purchasers, the total dollar amount of securities sold, the net proceeds received by the savings association from the issuance, and the amount of covered securities, net of all expenses, to be included as tier 2 capital;

      (2) Three copies of an executed form of the securities and a copy of any related documents governing the issuance or administration of the securities; and

      (3) A certification by the appropriate executive officer indicating that the savings association complied with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the offering, issuance, and sale of the securities.

      § 5.58   Pass-through investments by a Federal savings association.

#### § § 5.58

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1828, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  Federal savings associations are permitted to make various types of equity investments pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1464 and other statutes, including pass-through investments authorized under 12 CFR 160.32(a). These investments are in addition to those subject to §§ 5.35, 5.37, 5.38, and 5.59. This section describes the procedure governing the filing of the application or notice that the OCC requires in connection with certain of these investments. The OCC may review other permissible equity investments on a case-by-case basis.

      (c)  A Federal savings association must file a notice or application as prescribed in this section to make a pass-through investment authorized under 12 CFR 160.32(a).

      (d)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or similar business entity.

      (2)  means an investment authorized under 12 CFR 160.32(a). A  does not include a Federal savings association holding interests in a trust formed for the purposes of securitizing assets held by the savings association as part of its business or for the purposes of holding multiple legal titles of motor vehicles or equipment in conjunction with lease financing transactions.

      (e)  Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section, a Federal savings association may make a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in an activity described in § 5.38(f)(5) or in an activity that is substantively the same as a previously approved activity by filing a written notice. The Federal savings association must file this written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the investment. The written notice must:

      (1) Describe the structure of the investment and the activity or activities conducted by the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing. To the extent the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the Federal savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the savings association should describe the type of insurance activity that the company is engaged in and has present plans to conduct. The Federal savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable;

      (2) State:

      (i) Which paragraphs of § 5.38(f)(5) describe the activity; or

      (ii) If the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity:

      (A) How, the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity;

      (B) The citation to the applicable precedent; and

      (C) That the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;

      (3) Certify that the Federal savings association is well capitalized and well managed at the time of the investment;

      (4) Describe how the Federal savings association has the ability to prevent the enterprise from engaging in an activity that is not set forth in § 5.38(f)(5) or not contained in published OCC (including published former OTS) precedent for previously approved activities, or how the savings association otherwise has the ability to withdraw its investment;

      (5) Describe how the investment is convenient and useful to the Federal savings association in carrying out its business and not a mere passive investment unrelated to the savings association's banking business;

      (6) Certify that the Federal savings association's loss exposure is limited as a legal matter and that the savings association does not have unlimited liability for the obligations of the enterprise; and

      (7) Certify that the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing agrees to be subject to OCC supervision and examination, subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).

      (f) —(1)  A Federal savings association must file an application and obtain prior approval before making or acquiring, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a pass-through investment in an enterprise if the pass-through investment does not qualify for the notice procedure set forth in paragraph (e) of this section because the savings association is unable to make the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) or the certification required by paragraphs (e)(3) or (e)(7) of this section. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the Federal savings association is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the savings association's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a Federal savings association and why the filer should be permitted to hold a pass-through investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity. A Federal savings association may not make a pass-through investment if it is unable to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section.

      (2)  An application submitted by a Federal savings association is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 10th day after the application is received by the OCC if:

      (A) The Federal savings association makes the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) and the certification required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section;

      (B) The book value of the Federal savings association's pass-through investment for which the application is being submitted is no more than 1% of the savings association's capital and surplus;

      (C) No more than 50% of the enterprise is owned or controlled by banks or savings associations subject to examination by an appropriate Federal banking agency or credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Association; and

      (D) The OCC has not notified the Federal savings association that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

      (3)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if an enterprise in which a Federal savings association proposes to invest would be a subsidiary of the Federal savings association for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1828(m) and the enterprise would not be an operating subsidiary or a service corporation, the Federal savings association must file an application with the OCC under paragraph (f)(3) of this section at least 30 days prior to making the investment and obtain prior approval from the OCC before making the investment. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the Federal savings association is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the savings association's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a Federal savings association and why the filer should be permitted to hold a pass-through investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity. A Federal savings association may not make a pass-through investment if it is unable to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section.

      (g)  A Federal savings association may make or acquire, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a pass-through investment in an enterprise, without an application or notice to the OCC, if:

      (1) The activities of the enterprise are limited to those activities previously reported by the savings association in connection with the making or acquiring of a pass-through investment;

      (2) The activities in the enterprise continue to be legally permissible for a Federal savings association;

      (3) The savings association's pass-through investment will be made in accordance with any conditions imposed by the OCC or OTS in approving any prior pass-through investment conducting these activities;

      (4) The savings association is able to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(7) of this section; and

      (5) The enterprise will not be a subsidiary for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1828(m).

      (h)  Certain pass-through investments may be eligible for expedited treatment where the Federal savings association's investment is in an enterprise holding assets in satisfaction of debts previously contracted or the savings association acquires shares of a company in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.

      (1)  A Federal savings association that is well capitalized and well managed may acquire a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in the activities of holding and managing assets acquired by the parent savings association through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted, by filing a written notice in accordance with this paragraph (h)(1). The activities of the enterprise must be conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a Federal savings association. The Federal savings association must file the written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the pass-through investment. This notice must include a complete description of the Federal savings association's investment in the enterprise and the activities conducted, a description of how the savings association plans to divest the pass-through investment or the underlying assets within applicable statutory time frames, and a representation and undertaking that the savings association will conduct the activities in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activities. Any Federal savings association receiving approval under this paragraph (h)(1) is deemed to have agreed that the enterprise will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (2)  A Federal savings association is not required to file a notice or application under this § 5.58 if it acquires a non-controlling investment in shares of a company through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted.

      (i)  A Federal savings association may make a pass-through investment without filing a notice or application to the OCC if all of the following conditions are met:

      (1) The investment is in an investment company the portfolio of which consists exclusively of assets that the Federal savings association may hold directly;

      (2) The Federal savings association is not investing more than 10 percent of its total capital (or, in the case of a Federal savings association that is a qualifying community banking organization that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework, 10 percent of its tier 1 capital, as used under § 3.12 of this chapter) in one company;

      (3) The book value of the Federal savings association's aggregate pass-through investments does not exceed 25 percent of its total capital (or, in the case of a Federal savings association that is a qualifying community banking organization that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework, 25 percent of its tier 1 capital, as used under § 3.12 of this chapter) after making the investment;

      (4) The investment would not give Federal savings association direct or indirect control of the company; and

      (5) The Federal savings association's liability is limited to the amount of its investment.

      (j)  Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      § 5.59   Service corporations of Federal savings associations.

#### § § 5.59

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464(c)(4)(B), 1828, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

      (b)  When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(m)), a Federal savings association must file an application as prescribed in this section to:

      (1) Acquire or establish a service corporation; or

      (2) Commence a new activity in an existing service corporation subsidiary.

      (c)  This section sets forth the OCC's requirements regarding service corporations of Federal savings associations, and sets forth procedures governing OCC review and approval of filings by Federal savings associations to establish or acquire service corporations and filings by Federal savings associations to conduct new activities in existing service corporation subsidiaries, pursuant to the authority provided in section 5(c)(4)(B) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B).

      (d) —(1)  has the meaning set forth at 12 U.S.C. 1841 and the Federal Reserve Board's regulations thereunder, at 12 CFR part 225.

      (2)  means a service corporation in which a Federal savings association has a direct or indirect ownership interest and whose assets are consolidated with those of the savings association for purposes of reporting under GAAP.

      (3)  means any equity interest in a business organization, including stock, limited or general partnership interests, or shares in a limited liability company.

      (4)  means any entity that satisfies all of the requirements for service corporations in 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B) and this part, and that is designated by the investing Federal savings association as a service corporation pursuant to this section. A service corporation may be a first-tier service corporation of a Federal savings association or may be a lower-tier service corporation.

      (5)  means a service corporation of a Federal savings association that is controlled by that savings association.

      (e) —(1)  Only Federal or State-chartered savings associations with home offices in the State where the relevant Federal savings association has its home office may have an ownership interest in a first-tier service corporation. A Federal savings association need not have any minimum percentage ownership interest or have control of a service corporation in order to designate an entity as a service corporation.

      (2)  A first-tier service corporation must be organized under the laws of the State where the relevant Federal savings association's home office is located.

      (3)  A service corporation may engage in any of the designated permissible service corporation activities listed in paragraph (f) of this section, subject to any applicable filing requirement under paragraph (h) of this section. In addition, a Federal savings association may request OCC approval for a service corporation to engage in any other activity reasonably related to the activities of financial institutions.

      (4)  A Federal savings association's investment in service corporations is subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The assets of a Federal savings association's service corporations are not subject to the investment limitations applicable to the savings association under section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(c).

      (5)  A service corporation may be organized as a corporation, or may be organized in any other organizational form that provides the same protections as the corporate form of organization, including limited liability.

      (6)  In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m)(5), a Federal savings association may determine whether to consolidate the assets of a particular service corporation for purposes of calculating qualified thrift investments. If a service corporation's assets are not consolidated with the assets of the Federal savings association for that purpose, the savings association's investment in the service corporation will be considered in calculating the savings association's qualified thrift investments.

      (7)  (i) Each service corporation must be well managed and operate safely and soundly. In addition, each service corporation must pursue financial policies that are safe and consistent with the purposes of savings associations. Each service corporation must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation.

      (ii) The OCC may, at any time, limit a Federal savings association's investment in a service corporation, or limit or refuse to permit any activity of a service corporation, for supervisory, legal, or safety or soundness reasons.

      (8)  Federal savings associations and service corporations thereof must be operated in a manner that demonstrates to the public that each maintains a separate corporate existence. Each must operate so that:

      (i) Their respective business transactions, accounts, and records are not intermingled;

      (ii) Each observes the formalities of their separate corporate procedures;

      (iii) Each is held out to the public as a separate enterprise; and

      (iv) Unless the parent Federal savings association has guaranteed a loan to the service corporation, all borrowings by the service corporation indicate that the savings association is not liable.

      (9)  A service corporation must not state or imply that the securities it issues are covered by Federal deposit insurance. A service corporation subsidiary must not issue any security the payment, maturity, or redemption of which may be accelerated upon the condition that the controlling Federal savings association is insolvent or has been placed into receivership. For as long as any securities are outstanding, the controlling Federal savings association must maintain all records generated through each securities issuance in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to a copy of the prospectus, offering circular, or similar document concerning such issuance, and make such records available for examination by the OCC.

      (10)  A Federal savings association that made a non-controlling investment in a service corporation before May 18, 2015, but did not submit a filing under 12 U.S.C. 1828(m) with respect to such service corporation investment, is not required to file a service corporation application with respect to such investment pursuant to paragraph (b), provided that the Federal savings association does not acquire additional stock or similar interests in the service corporation, and the service corporation does not engage in any activities in which it was not engaged as of May 18, 2015.

      (f)  Subject to the prior filing requirements set forth in paragraph (h) of this section and the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a service corporation may engage in the following activities:

      (1)

      (2)  Service corporations may engage in the following activities only when such activities are limited to financial documents or financial clients or are generally finance-related:

      (8)  Community and economic development or public welfare investments that are permissible under part 24 of this chapter.

      (9)  Establishing or acquiring a corporation that is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as organized for charitable purposes under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and making a reasonable contribution to capitalize it,  that the corporation engages exclusively in activities designed to promote the well-being of communities in which the owners of the service corporation operate.

      (10)  Activities conducted on behalf of a customer on other than an “as principal” basis.

      (11)  Activities reasonably incident to those listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(10) of this section if the service corporation engages in those activities.

      (g) —(1)  Under the authority of section 5(c)(4)(B) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B)), a Federal savings association may invest up to 3 percent of its assets in the capital stock, obligations, and other securities of service corporations. Any investment that would cause a Federal savings association's investment in service corporations, in the aggregate, to exceed 2 percent of assets, or made while the savings association's investments in service corporations exceeds 2 percent of assets, must serve primarily community, inner city, or community and economic development or public welfare purposes consistent with 12 CFR part 24. A Federal savings association must designate the investments serving those purposes.

      (2)  In addition to the amounts that a Federal savings association may invest under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and to the extent that a Federal savings association has authority under other provisions of section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)), this part 5, and 12 CFR part 160, and available capacity within any applicable investment limits, a Federal savings association may make loans to any service corporation subject to the following conditions:

      (i) Loans to service corporations other than a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary are subject to the lending limits in part 32 of this chapter.

      (ii) The OCC may limit the amount of loans to any service corporation where safety and soundness considerations warrant such action.

      (3)  For purposes of this paragraph (g), the terms “loans” and “obligations” include all loans and other debt instruments (except accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business and paid within 60 days) and all guarantees or take-out commitments of such loans or debt instruments.

      (4)  Both debt and equity investments in service corporations that are GAAP-consolidated subsidiaries are considered investments in subsidiaries for purposes of 12 CFR part 3.

      (h) —(1)  (i) When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(m)), a Federal savings association must file an application at least 30 days before:

      (A) Acquiring or establishing a service corporation; or

      (B) Commencing a new activity in an existing service corporation subsidiary.

      (ii) The application must include a complete description of the savings association's investment in the service corporation, the proposed activities of the service corporation, the organizational structure and management of the service corporation, the relations between the savings association and the service corporation, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. If the service corporation proposes to engage in insurance activities, the savings association must describe the type of insurance activity in which the service corporation proposes to engage. The savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the service corporation holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the service corporation will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (2)  (i) An application to establish or acquire a service corporation, or to perform a new activity in an existing service corporation subsidiary, that meets the requirements of this paragraph is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review period is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2). Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the service corporation will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.

      (ii) An application is eligible for expedited review if the following requirements are met:

      (A) The savings association is well capitalized and well managed; and

      (B) The service corporation engages only in one or more of the preapproved activities listed in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (3)  The OCC reviews a Federal savings association's application to determine whether the proposal is legally permissible and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of this section, safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent Federal savings association. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.

      (4)  A Federal savings association that proposes to redesignate an operating subsidiary as a service corporation must submit a notification to the OCC at least 30 days prior to the redesignation date. The notification must include a description of how the redesignated entity will meet all of the requirements of this section, a resolution of the savings association's board of directors approving the redesignation, and the proposed effective date of the redesignation. The savings association may effect the redesignation on the proposed date unless the OCC notifies the savings association otherwise prior to that date. The OCC may require an application if the redesignation presents policy, supervisory, or legal issues.

      (5)  Sections 5.8, 5.10 and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

      (i)  (1) In accordance with this section, a Federal savings association may exercise its salvage power to make a contribution or a loan (including a guarantee of a loan made by any other person) to a service corporation (“salvage investment”) that exceeds the maximum amount otherwise permitted under law or regulation. A Federal savings association must notify the appropriate supervisory office at least 30 days before making such a salvage investment. The notification must demonstrate:

      (i) The salvage investment protects the savings association's interest in the service corporation;

      (ii) The salvage investment is consistent with safety and soundness; and

      (iii) The savings association considered alternatives to the salvage investment and determined that such alternatives would not adequately satisfy paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (2) If the OCC notifies the Federal savings association within 30 days of the filing of the notification that the notification presents supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, the Federal savings association must apply for and receive the OCC's prior written approval before making the salvage investment.

      (3) If a service corporation is a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary, the salvage investment will be considered an investment in a subsidiary for purposes of 12 CFR part 3.

    Subpart E—Payment of Dividends by National Banks

      § 5.60   Authority, scope, and exceptions to rules of general applicability.

#### § § 5.60

      (a)  12 U.S.C. 56, 60, and 93a.

      (b)  Except as otherwise provided, the restrictions in this subpart apply to the declaration and payment of all dividends by a national bank, including dividends paid in property. However, the provisions contained in § 5.64 do not apply to dividends paid in stock of the bank.

      (c)  Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this subpart.

      § 5.61   Definitions.

#### § § 5.61

      For the purposes of subpart E, the following definitions apply:

      (a)  and  have the same meaning as set forth in § 5.46.

      (b)  means the net income of a specified period less the total amount of all dividends declared in that period.

      § 5.62   Date of declaration of dividend.

#### § § 5.62

      A national bank must use the date a dividend is declared for the purposes of determining compliance with this subpart.

      § 5.63   Capital limitation under 12 U.S.C. 56.

#### § § 5.63

      (a)  Except as provided by 12 U.S.C. 59 and § 5.46, a national bank may not withdraw, or permit to be withdrawn, either in the form of a dividend or otherwise, any portion of its permanent capital. Further, a national bank may not declare a dividend in excess of undivided profits.

      (b)  The provisions of 12 U.S.C. 56 do not apply to dividends on preferred stock. However, if the undivided profits of the national bank are not sufficient to cover a proposed dividend on preferred stock, the proposed dividend constitutes a reduction in capital subject to 12 U.S.C. 59 and § 5.46.

      § 5.64   Earnings limitation under 12 U.S.C. 60.

#### § § 5.64

      (a)  As used in this section, the term “current year” means the calendar year in which a national bank declared, or proposes to declare, a dividend. The term “current year minus one” means the year immediately preceding the current year. The term “current year minus two” means the year that is two years prior to the current year. The term “current year minus three” means the year that is three years prior to the current year. The term “current year minus four” means the year that is four years prior to the current year.

      (b)  Subject to 12 U.S.C. 56 and this subpart, the directors of a national bank may declare and pay dividends of so much of the undivided profits as they judge to be expedient.

      (c) —(1)  For purposes of 12 U.S.C. 60, unless approved by the OCC in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a national bank may not declare a dividend if the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, declared by the national bank in any current year exceeds the total of the national bank's net income for the current year to date, combined with its retained net income of current year minus one and current year minus two, less the sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock.

      (2)  (i) If in current year minus one or current year minus two the bank declared dividends in excess of that year's net income, the excess does not reduce retained net income for the three-year period specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that the amount of excess dividends can be offset by retained net income in current year minus three or current year minus four. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus one, the excess is offset by retained net income in current year minus three and then by retained net income in current year minus two. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus two, the excess is first offset by retained net income in current year minus four and then by retained net income in current year minus three.

      (ii) If the bank's retained net income in current year minus three and current year minus four was insufficient to offset the full amount of the excess dividends declared, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the amount that is not offset will reduce the retained net income available to pay dividends in the current year.

      (iii) The calculation in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies only to retained net loss that results from dividends declared in excess of a single year's net income and does not apply to other types of current earnings deficits.

      (3)  A national bank may declare a dividend in excess of the amount described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, provided that the dividend is approved by the OCC. A national bank must submit a request for prior approval of a dividend under 12 U.S.C. 60 to the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

      § 5.65   Restrictions on undercapitalized institutions.

#### § § 5.65

      Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, a national bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the national bank would be “undercapitalized” as defined in 12 CFR part 6.

      § 5.66   Dividends payable in property other than cash.

#### § § 5.66

      In addition to cash dividends, directors of a national bank may declare dividends payable in property, with the approval of the OCC. A national bank must submit a request for prior approval of a noncash dividend to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The dividend is equivalent to a cash dividend in an amount equal to the actual current value of the property, regardless of whether the book value is higher or lower under GAAP. Before the dividend is declared, the bank should show the difference between actual value and book value on the books of the national bank as a gain or loss, as applicable, and the dividend should then be declared in the amount of the actual current value of the property being distributed.

      § 5.67   Fractional shares.

#### § § 5.67

      A national bank issuing additional stock may adopt arrangements to preclude the issuance of fractional shares. The bank may remit the cash equivalent of the fraction not being issued to those to whom fractional shares would otherwise be issued. The cash equivalent is based on the market value of the stock, if there is an established and active market in the national bank's stock. In the absence of such a market, the cash equivalent is based on a reliable and disinterested determination as to the fair market value of the stock if such stock is available. The bank may propose an alternate method in the application for the stock issuance filed with the OCC.

      (2)  A foreign bank must submit an application and obtain prior approval from the OCC before it:

      (i) Establishes a Federal branch or agency; or

L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991)) (12 U.S.C. 1831o).

      (b)  Section 38 of the FDI Act establishes a framework of supervisory actions for insured depository institutions that are not adequately capitalized. The principal purpose of this subpart is to define, for insured national banks and insured Federal savings associations, the capital measures and capital levels, and for insured Federal branches, comparable asset-based measures and levels, that are used for determining the supervisory actions authorized under section 38 of the FDI Act. This part 6 also establishes procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans and for issuance and review of directives and orders pursuant to section 38.

      (c)  This subpart implements the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act as they apply to insured national banks, insured Federal branches, and insured Federal savings associations. Certain of these provisions also apply to officers, directors, and employees of these insured institutions. Other provisions apply to any company that controls an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association and to the affiliates of an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association.

      (d)  Neither section 38 nor this part in any way limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, deficient capital levels, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 38 of the FDI Act and this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the OCC, including issuance of cease and desist orders, capital directives, approval or denial of applications or notices, assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.

      (e)  The assignment of an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association under this subpart within a particular capital category is for purposes of implementing and applying the provisions of section 38. Unless permitted by the OCC or otherwise required by law, no national bank or Federal savings association may state in any advertisement or promotional material its capital category under this subpart or that the OCC or any other Federal banking agency has assigned the national bank or Federal savings association to a particular capital category.

      (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association shall file a written capital restoration plan with the OCC within 45 days of the date that the national bank or Federal savings association receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the national bank or Federal savings association is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, unless the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An adequately capitalized national bank or Federal savings association that has been required, pursuant to § 6.4 and subpart M of part 19 of this chapter to comply with supervisory actions as if the national bank or Federal savings association were undercapitalized is not required to submit a capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that has already submitted and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under section 38 and this subpart is not required to submit an additional capital restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures or a reclassification of the institution pursuant to § 6.4 and subpart M of part 19 of this chapter unless the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association that it must submit a new or revised capital plan. A national bank or Federal savings association that is notified that it must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan shall file the plan in writing with the OCC within 45 days of receiving such notice, unless the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that the plan must be filed within a different period.

      (b)  All financial data submitted in connection with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided on the Call Report, unless the OCC instructs otherwise. The capital restoration plan shall include all of the information required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act. A national bank or Federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan as the result of a reclassification of the national bank or Federal savings association, pursuant to § 6.4 and subpart M of part 19 of this chapter shall include a description of the steps the national bank or Federal savings association will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice. No plan shall be accepted unless it includes any performance guarantee described in section 38(e)(2)(C) of that Act by each company that controls the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (c)  Within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan under this subpart, the OCC shall provide written notice to the national bank or Federal savings association of whether the plan has been approved. The OCC may extend the time within which notice regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.

      (d)  If a capital restoration plan is not approved by the OCC, the national bank or Federal savings association shall submit a revised capital restoration plan within the time specified by the OCC. Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized national bank or Federal savings association (as defined in § 6.4) shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable until such time as a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted by the national bank or Federal savings association has been approved by the OCC.

      (e)  A national bank or Federal savings association that is undercapitalized (as defined in § 6.4) and that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the period provided in this section shall, upon the expiration of that period, be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly undercapitalized national banks or Federal savings associations.

      (f)  Any undercapitalized national bank or Federal savings association that fails, in any material respect, to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly undercapitalized national banks or Federal savings associations.

      (g)  A national bank or Federal savings association that has submitted an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the OCC, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the national bank or Federal savings association shall implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed amendment.

      (h)  Within 45 days of the effective date of OCC approval of a capital restoration plan, or any amendment to a capital restoration plan, the OCC shall provide a copy of the plan or amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      (i) —(1) —(i)  The aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under section 38 and this subpart for all companies that control a specific national bank or Federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan under this subpart shall be limited to the lesser of:

      (A) An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total assets at the time the national bank or Federal savings association was notified or deemed to have notice that the national bank or Federal savings association was undercapitalized; or

      (B) The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of the national bank or Federal savings association to the levels required for the national bank or Federal savings association to be classified as adequately capitalized, as those capital measures and levels are defined at the time that the national bank or Federal savings association initially fails to comply with a capital restoration plan under this subpart.

      (ii)  The guarantee and limit of liability under section 38 and this subpart shall expire after the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The expiration or fulfillment by a company of a guarantee of a capital restoration plan shall not limit the liability of the company under any guarantee required or provided in connection with any capital restoration plan filed by the same national bank or Federal savings association after expiration of the first guarantee.

      (iii)  Each company that controls a given national bank or Federal savings association shall be jointly and severally liable for the guarantee for such national bank or Federal savings association as required under section 38 and this subpart, and the OCC may require payment of the full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing the guarantee.

      (2)  In the event that a national bank or Federal savings association that is controlled by any company submits a capital restoration plan that does not contain the guarantee required under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act, the national bank or Federal savings association shall, upon submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this part that are applicable to national banks or Federal savings associations that have not submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.

      (3)  Failure by any company that controls a national bank or Federal savings association to perform fully its guarantee of any capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the national bank or Federal savings association shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this part that are applicable to national banks or Federal savings associations that have failed in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.

      (j)  The failure of a national bank or Federal savings association to implement, in any material respect, a capital restoration plan required under section 38 and this section shall subject the national bank or Federal savings association to the assessment of civil money penalties pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the FDI Act.

#### § § 6.21

      (a) —(1)  The OCC shall provide an undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized national bank or Federal savings association prior written notice of the OCC's intention to issue a directive requiring such national bank, Federal savings association, or company to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in section 38 that are within the OCC's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including section 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5).

      § 7.1000   Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking.

#### § § 7.1000

      (a)  This section identifies the criteria that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses to determine whether an activity is authorized as part of, or incidental to, the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority.

      (b)  The OCC may determine that activities are permissible under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority only if they are subject to standards or conditions designed to provide that the activities function as intended and are conducted safely and soundly, in accordance with other applicable statutes, regulations, or supervisory policies.

      (c)  (1) An activity is permissible for national banks as part of the business of banking if the activity is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority. In determining whether an activity that is not specifically included in 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority is part of the business of banking, the OCC considers the following factors:

      (i) Whether the activity is the functional equivalent to, or a logical outgrowth of, a recognized banking activity;

      (ii) Whether the activity strengthens the bank by benefiting its customers or its business;

      (iii) Whether the activity involves risks similar in nature to those already assumed by banks; and

      (iv) Whether the activity is authorized for State-chartered banks.

      (2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

      (d)  (1) An activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of banking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national banks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking. In determining whether an activity is convenient or useful to such activities, the OCC considers the following factors:

      (i) Whether the activity facilitates the production or delivery of a bank's products or services, enhances the bank's ability to sell or market its products or services, or improves the effectiveness or efficiency of the bank's operations, in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, techniques and new technologies for producing and delivering financial products and services; and

      (ii) Whether the activity enables the bank to use capacity acquired for its banking operations or otherwise avoid economic loss or waste.

      (2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

      § 7.1002   National bank and Federal savings association acting as finder.

#### § § 7.1002

      (a)  A finder may identify potential parties, make inquiries as to interest, introduce or arrange contacts or meetings of interested parties, act as an intermediary between interested parties, and otherwise bring parties together for a transaction that the parties themselves negotiate and consummate. It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to act as a finder. A Federal savings association may act as a finder to the extent those activities are incidental to the powers expressly authorized by the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) (12 U.S.C. 1461 ).

      (b) —(1)  The following list provides examples of permissible finder activities for national banks. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to a national bank's authority to act as a finder:

      (i) Communicating information about providers of products and services, and proposed offering prices and terms to potential markets for these products and services;

      (ii) Communicating to the seller an offer to purchase or a request for information, including forwarding completed applications, application fees, and requests for information to third-party providers;

      (iii) Arranging for third-party providers to offer reduced rates to those customers referred by the national bank;

      (iv) Providing administrative, clerical, and record keeping functions related to the national bank's finder activity, including retaining copies of documents, instructing and assisting individuals in the completion of documents, scheduling sales calls on behalf of sellers, and conducting market research to identify potential new customers for retailers;

      (v) Conveying between interested parties expressions of interest, bids, offers, orders, and confirmations relating to a transaction;

      (vi) Conveying other types of information between potential buyers, sellers, and other interested parties;

      (vii) Establishing rules of general applicability governing the use and operation of the finder service, including rules that:

      (A) Govern the submission of bids and offers by buyers, sellers, and other interested parties that use the finder service and the circumstances under which the finder service will pair bids and offers submitted by buyers, sellers, and other interested parties; and

      (B) Govern the manner in which buyers, sellers, and other interested parties may bind themselves to the terms of a specific transaction; and

      (viii) Acting as an electronic finder pursuant to § 7.5002(a)(1).

      (2)  The following list provides examples of finder activities that are permissible for _Federal savings associations._ This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to a Federal savings association's incidental powers:

      (i) Referring customers to a third party; and

      (ii) Providing services and products to customers indirectly through a third-party discount program.

      (c)  The authority to act as a finder does not enable a national bank or a Federal savings association to engage in brokerage activities that have not been found to be permissible for national banks or Federal savings associations, respectively.

      (d)  Unless otherwise prohibited by Federal law, a national bank or Federal savings association may advertise the availability of, and accept a fee for, the services provided pursuant to this section.

      § 7.1003   Money lent by a national bank at banking offices or at facilities other than banking offices.

#### § § 7.1003

      (a)  For purposes of what constitutes a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30, “money” is deemed to be “lent” only at the place, if any, where the borrower in-person receives loan proceeds directly from national bank funds:

      (1) From the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary; or

      (2) At a facility that is established by the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary.

      (b)  Loan proceeds directly from national bank funds may be received by a borrower in person at a place that is not the national bank's main office and is not licensed as a branch without violating 12 U.S.C. 36, 12 U.S.C. 81 and 12 CFR 5.30, provided that a third party is used to deliver the funds and the place is not established by the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary. A third party includes a person who satisfies the requirements of § 7.1012(c)(2), or one who customarily delivers loan proceeds directly from national bank funds under accepted industry practice, such as an attorney or escrow agent at a real estate closing.

      (c)  An operating subsidiary owned by a national bank may distribute loan proceeds from its own funds or bank funds directly to the borrower in person at offices the operating subsidiary has established without violating 12 U.S.C. 36, 12 U.S.C. 81 and 12 CFR 5.30 provided that the operating subsidiary provides similar services on substantially similar terms and conditions to customers of unaffiliated entities including unaffiliated banks.

A national bank or its operating subsidiary may solicit loan customers, market loan products, assist persons in completing application forms and related documents to obtain a loan, originate and approve loans, make credit decisions regarding a loan application, and offer other lending-related services such as loan information and applications at a loan production office without violating 12 U.S.C. 36 and 12 U.S.C. 81, provided that “money” is not deemed to be “lent” at that site within the meaning of § 7.1003 and the site does not accept deposits or pay withdrawals.

      § 7.1011   National bank acting as payroll issuer.

#### § § 7.1011

      A national bank may disburse to an employee of a customer payroll funds deposited with the bank by that customer. The bank may disburse those funds by direct payment to the employee, by crediting an account in the employee's name at the disbursing bank, or by forwarding funds to another institution in which an employee maintains an account.

      § 7.1012   Establishment, operation, or use of a messenger service by a national bank.

#### § § 7.1012

      (a)  For purposes of this section, a “messenger service” means any service, such as a courier service or armored car service, used by a national bank and its customers to pick up from, and deliver to, specific customers at locations such as their homes or offices, items relating to transactions between the bank and those customers.

      (b)  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), a national bank may establish and operate a messenger service, or use, with its customers, a third party messenger service. The bank may use the messenger service to transport items relevant to the bank's transactions with its customers without regard to the branching limitations set forth in 12 U.S.C. 36, provided the service does not engage in branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j). In establishing or using such a facility, the national bank may establish terms, conditions, and limitations consistent with this section and appropriate to assure compliance with safe and sound banking practices.

      (c)  (1) Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), a national bank and its customers may use a messenger service to pick up from and deliver to customers items that relate to branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36, provided the messenger service is established and operated by a third party. In using such a facility, a national bank may establish terms, conditions, and limitations, consistent with this section and appropriate to assure compliance with safe and sound banking practices.

      (2) The OCC reviews whether a messenger service is established by a third party on a case-by-case basis, considering all of the circumstances. However, a messenger service is clearly established by a third party if:

      (i) A party other than the national bank owns or rents the messenger service and its facilities and employs the persons who provide the service;

      (ii)(A) The messenger service retains the discretion to determine in its own business judgment which customers and geographic areas it will serve; or

      (B) If the messenger service and the bank are under common ownership or control, the messenger service actually provides its services to the general public, including other depository institutions, and retains the discretion to determine in its own business judgment which customers and geographic areas it will serve;

      (iii) The messenger service maintains ultimate responsibility for scheduling, movement, and routing;

      (iv) The messenger service does not operate under the name of the bank, and the bank and the messenger service do not advertise, or otherwise represent, that the bank itself is providing the service, although the bank may advertise that its customers may use one or more third party messenger services to transact business with the bank;

      (v) The messenger service assumes responsibility for the items during transit and for maintaining adequate insurance covering thefts, employee fidelity, and other in-transit losses; and

      (vi) The messenger service acts as the agent for the customer when the items are in transit. The bank deems items intended for deposit to be deposited when credited to the customer's account at the bank's main office, one of its branches, or another permissible facility, such as a back-office facility that is not a branch. The bank deems items representing withdrawals to be paid when the items are given to the messenger service.

      (3) A national bank may defray all or part of the costs incurred by a customer in transporting items through a messenger service. Payment of those costs may only cover expenses associated with each transaction involving the customer and the messenger service. The national bank may impose terms, conditions, and limitations that it deems appropriate with respect to the payment of such costs.

      (d)  A national bank may establish and operate a messenger service to transport items relevant to the bank's transactions with its customers if such transactions constitute one or more branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j), provided the bank receives approval to establish a branch pursuant to 12 CFR 5.30.

      § 7.1014   Sale of money orders at nonbanking outlets by a national bank.

#### § § 7.1014

      A national bank may designate bonded agents to sell the bank's money orders at nonbanking outlets. The responsibility of both the bank and its agent should be defined in a written agreement setting forth the duties of both parties and providing for remuneration of the agent. The bank's agents need not report on sales and transmit funds from the nonbanking outlets more frequently than at the end of the third business day following receipt of the funds.

      § 7.1015   National bank and Federal savings association investments in small business investment companies.

#### § § 7.1015

      (a)  A national bank may invest in a small business investment company (SBIC) or in any entity established solely to invest in SBICs, including purchasing the stock of a SBIC, subject to appropriate capital limitations ( 15 U.S.C. 682(b)), and may receive the benefits of such stock ownership ( stock dividends). The receipt and retention of a dividend by a national bank from a SBIC in the form of stock of a corporate borrower of the SBIC is not a purchase of stock within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh).

      (b)  Federal savings associations may invest in a SBIC or in any entity established solely to invest in SBICs as provided in 12 CFR 160.30.

      (c)  A national bank or Federal savings association may invest in a SBIC that is either:

      (1) Already organized and has obtained a license from the Small Business Administration; or

      (2) In the process of being organized.

      (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association may retain an interest in a SBIC that has voluntarily surrendered its license to operate as a SBIC in accordance with 13 CFR 107.1900 and does not make any new investments (other than investments in cash equivalents, which, for the purposes of this paragraph (d), means high quality, highly liquid investments whose maturity corresponds to the issuer's expected or potential need for funds and whose currency corresponds to the issuer's assets) after such voluntary surrender.

      § 7.1016   Independent undertakings issued by a national bank or Federal savings association to pay against documents.

#### § § 7.1016

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may issue and commit to issue letters of credit and other independent undertakings within the scope of applicable laws or rules of practice recognized by law.  Under such independent undertakings, the national bank's or Federal savings association's obligation to honor depends upon the presentation of specified documents and not upon nondocumentary conditions or resolution of questions of fact or law at issue between the applicant and the beneficiary. A national bank or Federal savings association also may confirm or otherwise undertake to honor or purchase specified documents upon their presentation under another person's independent undertaking within the scope of such laws or rules.

      (b) —(1)  As a matter of safe and sound banking practice, national banks and Federal savings associations that issue independent undertakings should not be exposed to undue risk. At a minimum, national banks and Federal savings associations should consider the following:

      (i) The independent character of the undertaking should be apparent from its terms (such as terms that subject it to laws or rules providing for its independent character);

      (ii) The undertaking should be limited in amount;

      (iii) The undertaking should:

      (A) Be limited in duration; or

      (B) Permit the national bank or Federal savings association to terminate the undertaking either on a periodic basis (consistent with the bank's or savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments) or at will upon either notice or payment to the beneficiary; or

      (C) Entitle the national bank or Federal savings association to cash collateral from the applicant on demand (with a right to accelerate the applicant's obligations, as appropriate); and

      (iv) The national bank or Federal savings association either should be fully collateralized or have a post-honor right of reimbursement from the applicant or from another issuer of an independent undertaking. Alternatively, if the national bank's or Federal savings association's undertaking is to purchase documents of title, securities, or other valuable documents, the bank or savings association should obtain a first priority right to realize on the documents if the bank or savings association is not otherwise to be reimbursed.

      (2)  Certain undertakings require particular protections against credit, operational, and market risk:

      (i) In the event that the undertaking is to honor by delivery of an item of value other than money, the national bank or Federal savings association should ensure that market fluctuations that affect the value of the item will not cause the bank or savings association to assume undue market risk;

      (ii) In the event that the undertaking provides for automatic renewal, the terms for renewal should be consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments prior to renewal;

      (iii) In the event that a national bank or Federal savings association issues an undertaking for its own account, the underlying transaction for which it is issued must be within the bank's or savings association's authority and comply with any safety and soundness requirements applicable to that transaction.

      (3)  The national bank or Federal savings association should possess operational expertise that is commensurate with the sophistication of its independent undertaking activities.

      (4)  The national bank or Federal savings association must accurately reflect the bank's or savings association's undertakings in its records, including any acceptance or deferred payment or other absolute obligation arising out of its contingent undertaking.

      (c)  An independent undertaking within the meaning of this section is not subject to the provisions of § 7.1017.

      § 7.1017   National bank as guarantor or surety on indemnity bond.

#### § § 7.1017

      (a) A national bank may lend its credit, bind itself as a surety to indemnify another, or otherwise become a guarantor (including, pursuant to 12 CFR 28.4, guaranteeing the deposits and other liabilities of its Edge corporations and Agreement corporations and of its corporate instrumentalities in foreign countries), if:

      (1) The bank has a substantial interest in the performance of the transaction involved (for example, a bank, as fiduciary, has a sufficient interest in the faithful performance by a cofiduciary of its duties to act as surety on the bond of such cofiduciary); or

      (2) The transaction is for the benefit of a customer and the bank obtains from the customer a segregated deposit that is sufficient in amount to cover the bank's total potential liability. A segregated deposit under this section includes collateral:

      (i) In which the bank has perfected its security interest (for example, if the collateral is a printed security, the bank must have obtained physical control of the security, and, if the collateral is a book entry security, the bank must have properly recorded its security interest); and

      (ii) That has a market value, at the close of each business day, equal to the bank's total potential liability and is composed of:

      (A) Cash;

      (B) Obligations of the United States or its agencies;

      (C) Obligations fully guaranteed by the United States or its agencies as to principal and interest; or

      (D) Notes, drafts, or bills of exchange or bankers' acceptances that are eligible for rediscount or purchase by a Federal Reserve Bank; or

      (iii) That has a market value, at the close of each business day, equal to 110 percent of the bank's total potential liability and is composed of obligations of a State or political subdivision of a State.

      (b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may guarantee obligations of a customer, subsidiary or affiliate that are financial in character, provided the amount of the bank's financial obligation is reasonably ascertainable and otherwise consistent with applicable law.

      § 7.1018   National bank automatic payment plan accounts.

#### § § 7.1018

      A national bank may, for the benefit and convenience of its savings depositors, adopt an automatic payment plan under which a savings account will earn dividends at the current rate paid on regular savings accounts. The depositor, upon reaching a previously designated age, receives his or her accumulated savings and earned interest in installments of equal amounts over a specified period.

      § 7.1020   Purchase of open accounts by a national bank.

#### § § 7.1020

      (a)  The purchase of open accounts is a part of the business of banking and within the power of a national bank.

      (b)  A national bank may purchase open accounts in connection with export transactions; the accounts should be protected by insurance such as that provided by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association and the Export-Import Bank.

      § 7.1021   Financial literacy programs not branches of national banks.

#### § § 7.1021

      A financial literacy program is a program the principal purpose of which is to be educational for members of the community. The premises of, or a facility used by, a school or other organization at which a national bank participates in a financial literacy program is not a branch for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36 provided the bank does not establish and operate the premises or facility. The OCC considers establishment and operation in this context on a case by case basis, considering the facts and circumstances. However, the premises or facility is not a branch of the national bank if the safe harbor test in § 7.1012(c)(2) applicable to messenger services established by third parties is satisfied. The factor discussed in § 7.1012(c)(2)(i) can be met if bank employee participation in the financial literacy program consists of managing the program or conducting or engaging in financial education activities provided the school or other organization retains control over the program and over the premises or facilities at which the program is held.

      § 7.1022   National banks' authority to buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion.

#### § § 7.1022

      (a) In this section,  means metal (including an alloy) in a physical form primarily suited to industrial or commercial use, for example, copper cathodes.

      (b)  Section 24(Seventh) of the National Bank Act authorizes national banks to buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion. Industrial or commercial metal is not exchange, coin, and bullion within the meaning of this authorization.

      (c)  Section 24(Seventh) authorizes national banks to engage in activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking. Buying and selling industrial or commercial metal for the purpose of dealing or investing in that metal is not part of or incidental to the business of banking pursuant to section 24(Seventh). Accordingly, national banks may not acquire industrial or commercial metal for purposes of dealing or investing.

      (d)  This section may not be construed to preclude a national bank from acquiring or selling metal in connection with its incidental authority to foreclose on loan collateral, compromise doubtful claims, or avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted. This section also may not be construed to preclude a national bank from buying and selling physical metal to hedge a derivative for which that metal is the reference asset so long as the amount of the physical metal used for hedging purposes is nominal.

      (e)  National banks that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a national bank makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.

      (a) In this section,  means metal (including an alloy) in a physical form primarily suited to industrial or commercial use, for example, copper cathodes.

      (b) Federal savings associations may not deal or invest in industrial or commercial metal.

      (c)  This section may not be construed to preclude a Federal savings association from acquiring or selling metal in connection with its authority to foreclose on loan collateral, compromise doubtful claims, or avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted.

      (d)  Federal savings associations that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a Federal savings association makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with safe and sound operation of the association.

      § 7.1024   National bank or Federal savings association ownership of property.

#### § § 7.1024

      (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may invest in real estate that is necessary for the transaction of its business.

      (2)  Real estate investments permissible under this section include:

      (i) Premises that are owned and occupied (or to be occupied, if under construction) by the national bank or Federal savings association, or its respective branches or consolidated subsidiaries;

      (ii) Real estate acquired and intended, in good faith, for use in future expansion;

      (iii) Parking facilities that are used by customers or employees of the national bank or Federal savings association, or its respective branches or consolidated subsidiaries;

      (iv) Residential property for the use of officers or employees of the national bank or Federal savings association who are:

      (A) Located in remote areas where suitable housing at a reasonable price is not readily available; or

      (B) Temporarily assigned to a foreign country, including foreign nationals temporarily assigned to the United States; and

      (v) Property for the use of national bank or Federal savings association officers, employees, or customers, or for the temporary lodging of such persons in areas where suitable commercial lodging is not readily available, provided that the purchase and operation of the property qualifies as a deductible business expense for Federal tax purposes.

      (3)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may acquire and hold real estate under this paragraph (a) by any reasonable and prudent means, including ownership in fee, a leasehold estate, or in an interest in a cooperative. The national bank or Federal savings association may hold this real estate directly or through one or more subsidiaries. The national bank or Federal savings association may organize a banking premises subsidiary as a corporation, partnership, or similar entity ( a limited liability company).

      (ii) A Federal savings association also may acquire and hold banking premises through a service corporation in accordance with 12 CFR 5.59.

      (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association may own fixed assets necessary for the transaction of its business, such as fixtures, furniture, and data processing equipment.

      (c) —(1)  Twelve CFR 5.37(d)(1)(i) and (d)(3)(i) provide quantitative investment limitations that govern when OCC approval is required for a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in banking premises.

      (2)  (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must seek approval from the OCC in accordance with 12 CFR 5.37(d).

      (ii) A Federal savings association that invests in banking premises through a service corporation must comply with the quantitative limitations in 12 CFR 5.37(d) and, to the extent applicable, 12 CFR 5.59.

      (3)  An unexercised option to purchase banking premises or stock in a corporation holding banking premises is not an investment in banking premises. However, a national bank or Federal savings association seeking to exercise such an option must comply with the requirements in 12 CFR 5.37(d).

      (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association normally should use real estate acquired for future national bank or Federal savings association expansion within five years. After holding such real estate for one year, the national bank or Federal savings association must state, by resolution of its board of directors or an appropriately authorized bank or savings association official or subcommittee of the board, definite plans for its use. The resolution or other official action must be available for inspection by OCC examiners.

      (e)  If, on May 18, 2015, a Federal savings association holds an investment in real estate, fixed assets, banking premises, or other real property that complies with the legal requirements in effect prior to May 18, 2015, but would violate any provision of this section or § 5.37, the savings association may continue to hold such investment in accordance with the prior legal requirements. However, a Federal savings association that holds such an investment may not modify, expand or improve this investment, except for routine maintenance, without the prior approval of the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

#### § § 7.1025

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may engage in a tax equity finance transaction pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) and 1464 only if the transaction is the functional equivalent of a loan, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and the transaction satisfies applicable conditions in paragraph (d) of this section. The authority to engage in tax equity finance transactions under this section is pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) and 1464 lending authority and is separate from, and does not limit, other investment authorities available to national banks and Federal savings associations.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means the OCC office that is responsible for the supervision of a national bank or Federal savings association, as described in subpart A of 12 CFR part 4;

      (2)  has the same meaning that this term has in 12 CFR 32.2.

      (3)  means a transaction in which a national bank or Federal savings association provides equity financing to fund a project or projects that generate tax credits or other tax benefits and the use of an equity-based structure allows the transfer of those credits and other tax benefits to the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (c)  A tax equity finance transaction is the functional equivalent of a loan if:

      (1) The structure of the transaction is necessary for making the tax credits or other tax benefits available to the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (2) The transaction is of limited tenure and is not indefinite, including retaining a limited investment interest that is required by law to obtain continuing tax benefits or needed to obtain the expected rate of return;

      (3) The tax benefits and other payments received by the national bank or Federal savings association from the transaction repay the investment and provide the expected rate of return at the time of underwriting;

      (4) Consistent with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association does not rely on appreciation of value in the project or property rights underlying the project for repayment;

      (5) The national bank or Federal savings association uses underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards that are substantially equivalent to the underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards used for a traditional commercial loan;

      (6) The national bank or Federal savings association is a passive investor in the transaction and is unable to direct the affairs of the project company; and

      (7) The national bank or Federal savings association appropriately accounts for the transaction initially and on an ongoing basis and has documented contemporaneously its accounting assessment and conclusion.

      (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association may engage in tax equity finance transactions only if:

      (1) The national bank or Federal savings association cannot control the sale of energy, if any, from the project;

      (2) The national bank or Federal savings association limits the total dollar amount of tax equity finance transactions undertaken pursuant to this section to no more than five percent of its capital and surplus, unless the OCC determines, by written approval of a written request by the national bank or Federal savings association to exceed the five percent limit, that a higher aggregate limit will not pose an unreasonable risk to the national bank or Federal savings association and that the tax equity finance transactions in the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio will not be conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner; provided, however, that in no case may a national bank or Federal savings association's total dollar amount of tax equity finance transactions undertaken pursuant to this section exceed 15 percent of its capital and surplus;

      (3) The national bank or Federal savings association has provided written notification to the appropriate OCC supervisory office, prior to engaging in each tax equity finance transaction that includes its evaluation of the risks posed by the transaction;

      (4) The national bank or Federal savings association can identify, measure, monitor, and control the associated risks of its tax equity finance transaction activities individually and as a whole on an ongoing basis to ensure that such activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner; and

      (5) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a legal opinion or has other good faith, reasoned bases for making a determination that tax credits or other tax benefits are available before engaging in a tax equity finance transaction.

      (e)  The transaction is subject to the substantive legal requirements of a loan, including the lending limits prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 84 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as appropriate, as implemented by 12 CFR part 32, and if the active investor or project sponsor of the transaction is an affiliate of the bank, to the restrictions on transactions with affiliates prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c-1, as implemented by 12 CFR part 223.

      § 7.1026   National bank and Federal savings association payment system memberships.

#### § § 7.1026

      (a)  National banks and Federal savings associations may become members of payment systems, subject to the requirements of this section.

      (b)  As used in this section:

      (1)  means the OCC office that is responsible for the supervision of a national bank or Federal savings association, as described in subpart A of 12 CFR part 4;

      (2)  includes a national bank or Federal savings association designated as a “member,” or “participant,” or other similar role by a payment system, including by a payment system that requires the national bank or Federal savings association to share in operational losses or maintain a reserve with the payment system to offset potential liability for operational losses. This definition includes indirect members only if they agree to be bound by the rules of the payment system and the rules of the payment system indicate indirect members are covered;

      (3)  refers to liability for operational losses that is not capped under the rules of the payment system and includes indemnifications of third parties provided as a condition of membership in the payment system;

      (4)  means a charge resulting from sources other than defaults by other members of the payment system. Examples of operational losses include losses that are due to: Employee misconduct, fraud, misjudgment, or human error; management failure; information systems failures; disruptions from internal or external events that result in the degradation or failure of services provided by the payment system; security breaches or cybersecurity events; or payment or settlement delays, constrained liquidity, contagious disruptions, and resulting litigation; and

      (5)  means “financial market utility” as defined in 12 U.S.C. 5462(6), wherever operating, and includes both retail and wholesale payment systems. _Payment system_ does not include a derivatives clearing organization registered under the Commodity Exchange Act, a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or foreign organization that would be considered a derivatives clearing organization or clearing agency were it operating in the United States.

      (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association must provide written notice to its appropriate OCC supervisory office at least 30 days prior to joining a payment system that exposes it to open-ended liability.

      (2)  A national bank or Federal savings association must provide written notice to its appropriate OCC supervisory office within 30 days of joining a payment system that does not expose it to open-ended liability.

      (d) —(1)  A notice required by paragraph (c) of this section must include representations that the national bank or Federal savings association:

      (i) Has complied with the safety and soundness review requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

      (ii) Will comply with the safety and soundness review and notification requirements in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.

      (2)  A notice filed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section also must include a representation that either:

      (i) The rules of the payment system do not impose liability for operational losses on members; or

      (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liability for operational losses is limited by the rules of the payment system to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:

      (A) The legal lending limit under 12 CFR part 32; or

      (B) The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC.

      (e)  (1) Prior to joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must:

      (i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and

      (ii) Ensure that it can measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.

      (2) After joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must manage the risks of the payment system on an ongoing basis. This ongoing risk management must:

      (i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and

      (ii) Measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.

      (3) If the national bank or Federal savings association identifies risks during the ongoing risk management required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section that raise safety and soundness concerns, such as a material change to the bank's or savings association's liability or indemnification responsibilities, the national bank or Federal savings association must:

      (i) Notify the appropriate OCC supervisory office as soon as the safety and soundness concern is identified; and

      (ii) Take appropriate actions to remediate the risk.

      (4) A national bank or Federal savings association that believes its open-ended liability is otherwise limited ( by negotiated agreements or laws of an appropriate jurisdiction) may consider its liability to be limited for purposes of the reviews required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section so long as:

      (i) Prior to joining the payment system, the bank or savings association obtains a written legal opinion that:

      (A) Describes how the payment system allocates liability for operational losses; and

      (B) Concludes the potential liability for operational losses for the national bank or Federal savings association is in fact limited to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:

      () The legal lending limit under _1_2 CFR part 32; or

      () The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC; and

      (ii) There are no material changes to the liability or indemnification requirements applicable to the bank or savings association since the issuance of the written legal opinion.

      (f)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association should evaluate, at a minimum, the following payment system characteristics when conducting an analysis required by paragraph (e) of this section:

      (i) Does the processing occur on a real-time gross settlement basis or provide reasonable assurance ( prefunding, etc.) that members will meet settlement obligations?

      (ii) How does the payment system's rules limit its liability to members?

      (iii) Does the payment system have insurance coverage and/or self-insurance arrangements to cover operational losses?

      (iv) Do the payment system's rules provide an unambiguous pro-rata loss allocation methodology under its indemnity provisions and does the methodology provide members the opportunity to reduce or eliminate liability exposure by decreasing or ceasing use of the payment system?

      § 7.1027   Establishment and operation of a remote service unit by a national bank.

#### § § 7.1027

      A remote service unit (RSU) is an automated or unstaffed facility, operated by a customer of a bank with at most delimited assistance from bank personnel, that conducts banking functions such as receiving deposits, paying withdrawals, or lending money. A national bank may establish and operate an RSU pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh). An RSU includes an automated teller machine, automated loan machine, automated device for receiving deposits, personal computer, telephone, other similar electronic devices, and drop boxes. An RSU may be equipped with a telephone or tele-video device that allows contact with bank personnel. An RSU is not a “branch” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j), and is not subject to State geographic or operational restrictions or licensing laws.

      § 7.1028   Establishment and operation of a deposit production office by a national bank.

#### § § 7.1028

      (a)  A national bank or its operating subsidiary may engage in deposit production activities at a site other than the main office or a branch of the bank. A national bank or its operating subsidiary may solicit deposits, provide information about deposit products, and assist persons in completing application forms and related documents to open a deposit account at a deposit production office (DPO). A DPO is not a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30(d)(1) so long as it does not receive deposits, pay withdrawals, or make loans. All deposit and withdrawal transactions of a bank customer using a DPO must be performed by the customer, either in person at the main office or a branch office of the bank, or by mail, electronic transfer, or a similar method of transfer.

      (b)  A national bank may use the services of, and compensate, persons not employed by the bank in its deposit production activities.

Since an LPO, DPO, or RSU is not, individually, a branch under 12 U.S.C. 36(j), any combination of these facilities at one location does not create a branch. The RSU at such a combined location must be primarily operated by the customer with at most delimited assistance from bank personnel.

      (1) Derivatives transactions with payments based on underlyings a national bank is permitted to purchase directly as an investment;

      (2) Derivatives transactions with any underlying to hedge the risks arising from bank-permissible activities;

      (3) Derivatives transactions as a financial intermediary with any underlying that are customer-driven, cash-settled, and either perfectly-matched or portfolio-hedged;

      (4) Derivatives transactions as a financial intermediary with any underlying that are customer-driven, physically-settled by transitory title transfer, and either perfectly-matched or portfolio-hedged; and

      (5) Derivatives transactions as a financial intermediary with any underlying that are customer-driven, physically-hedged, and either portfolio-hedged or hedged on a transaction-by-transaction basis, and provided that:

      (ii) Physical hedging activities meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

      (d)  (1) A national bank must provide notice to its Examiner-in-Charge prior to engaging in any of the following with respect to derivatives transactions with payments based on underlyings that a national bank is not permitted to purchase directly as an investment:

      (i) Engaging in derivatives hedging activities pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

      (ii) Expanding the bank's derivatives hedging activities pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section to include a new category of underlying for derivatives transactions;

      (iii) Engaging in customer-driven financial intermediation derivatives activities pursuant to paragraph (c)(3), (4), or (5) of this section; and

      (iv) Expanding the bank's customer-driven financial intermediation derivatives activities pursuant to paragraph (c)(3), (4), or (5) of this section to include any new category of underlyings.

      (iii) A detailed description of the bank's risk management system (policies, processes, personnel, and control systems) for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the risks of the activity.

      (e)  (1) A national bank engaging in physical hedging activities pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section must hold the underlying solely to hedge risks arising from derivatives transactions originated by customers for the customers' valid and independent business purposes.

      (2) The physical hedging activities must offer a cost-effective means to hedge risks arising from permissible banking activities.

      (3) The national bank must not take anticipatory or maintain residual positions in the underlying except as necessary for the orderly establishment or unwinding of a hedging position.

Title to commodities acquired and immediately sold by a transitory title transfer does not count against the 5 percent limit;

      (ii) The physical position must more effectively reduce risk than a cash-settled hedge referencing the same commodity; and

      (iii) The physical position hedges a physically-settled customer-driven commodity derivative transaction(s).

      (f)  A national bank must adhere to safe and sound banking practices in conducting the activities described in this section.

    Subpart B—Corporate Practices

      § 7.2000   National bank corporate governance.

#### § § 7.2000

      (a)  The corporate governance provisions in a national bank's articles of association and bylaws and the bank's conduct of its corporate governance affairs must comply with applicable Federal banking statutes and regulations and safe and sound banking practices.

      (b)  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal banking statutes or regulations, or bank safety and soundness, a national bank may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of the law of any State in which the main office or any branch of the bank is located, the law of any State in which a holding company of the bank is incorporated, the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter), or the Model Business Corporation Act (1984, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter). A national bank must designate in its bylaws the body of law selected for its corporate governance provisions.

      (c)  A national bank that has elected to follow the corporate governance provisions of the law of the State in which its holding company is incorporated may continue to use those provisions even if the bank is no longer controlled by that holding company.

      (d)  A national bank may request the views of OCC staff on the permissibility of a national bank's adoption of a particular State corporate governance provision. Requests must include the following information:

      (1) The name of the national bank;

      (2) Citation to the State statutes or regulations involved;

      (3) A discussion as to whether a similarly situated State bank is subject to or may adopt the corporate governance provision;

      (4) Identification of all Federal banking statutes or regulations that are on the same subject as, or otherwise have a bearing on, the subject of the proposed State corporate governance provision; and

      (5) An analysis of how the proposed practice is not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes or regulations and is not inconsistent with bank safety and soundness.

      § 7.2001   National bank adoption of anti-takeover provisions.

#### § § 7.2001

      (a)  Pursuant to § 7.2000(b), a national bank may adopt anti-takeover provisions included in State corporate governance law if the provisions are not inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations and not inconsistent with bank safety and soundness.

      (b)  State anti-takeover provisions that are not inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations include the following:

      (1)  State provisions that prohibit, or that permit the corporation to prohibit in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, the corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder or any related entity for a specified period of time from the date on which the shareholder first becomes an interested shareholder, subject to certain exceptions such as board approval. An interested shareholder is one that owns an amount of stock specified in the State provision.

      (2)  State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that all the shareholders, other than the hostile acquiror, have the right to purchase additional stock at a substantial discount upon the occurrence of a triggering event.

      (3)  State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that all actions to be taken by shareholders must occur at a meeting and that shareholders may not take action by written consent.

      (4)  State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that:

      (i) Only the board of directors, and not the shareholders, have the right to call special meetings of the shareholders; or

      (ii) If shareholders have the right to call special meetings, a high percentage of shareholders is needed to call the meeting.

      (5)  State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that shareholders may remove a director only for cause, and not both for cause and without cause.

      (c)  The following State anti-takeover provisions are inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations:

      (1)  State provisions that require, or that permit the corporation to require in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, a supermajority of the shareholders to approve specified matters are inconsistent when applied to matters for which Federal banking statutes or regulations specify the required level of shareholder approval.

      (2)  State provisions that prohibit, or that permit the corporation in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document to prohibit, a person from voting shares acquired that increase their percentage of ownership of the company's stock above a certain level are inconsistent when applied to shareholder votes governed by 12 U.S.C. 61.

      (d) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any State corporate governance provision, including anti-takeover provisions, that would render more difficult or discourage an injection of capital by purchase of bank stock, a merger, the acquisition of the bank, a tender offer, a proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the bank's stock, or the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management is inconsistent with bank safety and soundness if:

      (i) The bank is less than adequately capitalized (as defined in 12 CFR part 6);

      (ii) The bank is in troubled condition (as defined in 12 CFR 5.51(c)(7));

      (iii) Grounds for the appointment of a receiver under 12 U.S.C. 191, as determined by the OCC, are present; or

      (iv) The bank is otherwise in less than satisfactory condition, as determined by the OCC.

      (2)  Anti-takeover provisions are not inconsistent with bank safety and soundness if, at the time the bank adopts the provisions:

      (i) The bank is not subject to any of the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and

      (ii) The bank includes, in its articles of association or its bylaws, as applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, a limitation that would make the provisions ineffective if:

      (A) The conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section exist; or

      (B) The OCC otherwise directs the bank not to follow the provision for supervisory reasons.

      (e) —(1)  Based on the substance of the provision or the individual circumstances of a national bank, the OCC may determine that a State anti-takeover provision, as proposed or adopted by a bank, is:

      (i) Inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations, notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section; or

      (ii) Inconsistent with bank safety and soundness other than as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2)  The OCC may initiate a review, or a bank may request OCC review pursuant to § 7.2000(d), of a State anti-takeover provision.

      (f) —(1)  A national bank must follow the provisions for approval by the board of directors and approval of shareholders for the adoption of an anti-takeover provision in the State corporate governance law it has elected to follow. However, if the provision is included in the bank's articles of association, the bank's shareholders must approve the amendment of the articles pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 21a, even if the State law does not require approval by the shareholders.

      (2)  If the State corporate governance law requires the anti-takeover provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association. If the State corporate governance law does not require the provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, but allows it to be in the bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in either its articles of association or in its bylaws, provided, however, that if the State corporate governance law requires shareholder approval for changes to the corporation's bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association.

      (2)  A national bank must follow the procedures for telephonic or electronic participation in a shareholder meeting of the corporate governance provisions it has elected to follow pursuant to § 7.2000(b), if those elected provisions include telephonic or electronic participation procedures; the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter); or the Model Business Corporation Act, provided, however, that such procedures are not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness. The national bank must indicate the use of these procedures in its bylaws.

Any listing of honorary or advisory directors must distinguish between them and the bank's board of directors or indicate their advisory status.

      § 7.2005   Ownership of stock necessary to qualify as director of a national bank.

#### § § 7.2005

      (a)  A national bank director must own a qualifying equity interest in a national bank or a company that has control of a national bank. The director must own the qualifying equity interest in his or her own right and meet a certain minimum threshold ownership.

      (b) —(1)  For purposes of this section, a qualifying equity interest includes common or preferred stock of the bank or of a company that controls the bank that has not less than an aggregate par value of $1,000, an aggregate shareholders' equity of $1,000, or an aggregate fair market value of $1,000.

      (i) The value of the common or preferred stock held by a national bank director is valued as of the date purchased or the date on which the individual became a director, whichever value is greater.

      (ii) In the case of a company that owns more than one national bank, a director may use his or her equity interest in the controlling company to satisfy, in whole or in part, the equity interest requirement for any or all of the controlled national banks.

      (iii) Upon request, the OCC may consider whether other interests in a company controlling a national bank constitute an interest equivalent to $1,000 par value of national bank stock.

      (2)  Shares held jointly or as a tenant in common are qualifying shares held by a director in his or her own right only to the extent of the aggregate value of the shares which the director would be entitled to receive on dissolution of the joint tenancy or tenancy in common.

      (3)  Shares deposited by a person in a living trust (inter vivos trust) as to which the person is a trustee and retains an absolute power of revocation are shares owned by the person in his or her own right.

      (4) —(i)  A director may hold his or her qualifying interest through a profit-sharing plan, individual retirement account, retirement plan, or similar arrangement, if the director retains beneficial ownership and legal control over the shares.

      (ii)  A director may acquire and hold his or her qualifying interest pursuant to a stock repurchase or buyback agreement with a transferring shareholder under which the director purchases the qualifying shares subject to an agreement that the transferring shareholder will repurchase the shares when, for any reason, the director ceases to serve in that capacity. The agreement may give the transferring shareholder a right of first refusal to repurchase the qualifying shares if the director seeks to transfer ownership of the shares to a third person.

      (iii)  A director may assign the right to receive all dividends or distributions on his or her qualifying shares to another, including a transferring shareholder, if the director retains beneficial ownership and legal control over the shares.

      § 7.2013   Fidelity bonds covering national bank officers and employees.

#### § § 7.2013

      (a)  All officers and employees of a national bank or Federal savings association must have adequate fidelity bond coverage. The failure of directors to require bonds with adequate sureties and in sufficient amount may make the directors liable for any losses that the bank or savings association sustains because of the absence of such bonds. Directors should not serve as sureties on such bonds. Directors should consider whether agents who have access to assets of the bank or savings association should also have fidelity bond coverage.

      (b)  The board of directors of the national bank or Federal savings association, or a committee thereof, must determine the amount of such coverage, premised upon a consideration of factors, including:

      (1) Internal auditing safeguards employed;

      (2) Number of employees;

      (3) Amount of deposit liabilities; and

      (4) Amount of cash and securities normally held by the bank or savings association.

#### § § 7.2014

      (a)  Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may indemnify an institution-affiliated party for damages and expenses, including the advancement of expenses and legal fees, in accordance with the law of the State the bank or savings association has designated for its corporate governance pursuant to § 7.2000(b) (for national banks), 12 CFR 5.21(j)(3)(ii) (for Federal mutual savings associations), or 12 CFR 5.22(j)(2)(ii) (for Federal stock savings associations), provided such payments are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term “institution-affiliated party” has the same meaning as set forth at 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).

      (b)  With respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any Federal banking agency, a national bank or Federal savings association may only make or agree to make indemnification payments to an institution-affiliated party that are reasonable and consistent with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 CFR chapter III.

      (c)  Before advancing funds to an institutional-affiliated party under this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must obtain a written agreement that the institution-affiliated party will reimburse the bank or savings association, as appropriate, for any portion of that indemnification that the institution-affiliated party is ultimately found not to be entitled to under 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 CFR chapter III, except to the extent that the bank's or savings association's expenses have been reimbursed by an insurance policy or fidelity bond.

      (d)  A national bank or Federal savings association may provide for the payment of reasonable premiums for insurance covering the expenses, legal fees, and liability of institution-affiliated parties to the extent that the expenses, fees, or liability could be indemnified under this section.

      § 7.2016   Restricting transfer of national bank stock and record dates; stock certificates.

#### § § 7.2016

      (a) —(1)  Under 12 U.S.C. 52, a national bank may impose conditions upon the transfer of its stock reasonably calculated to simplify the work of the bank with respect to stock transfers, voting at shareholders' meetings, and related matters and to protect it against fraudulent transfers.

      (2)  A national bank may close its stock records for a reasonable period to ascertain shareholders for voting purposes. The board of directors may fix a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any meeting of shareholders. The record date should be in reasonable proximity to the date that notice is given to the shareholders of the meeting.

      (b)  (1) A national bank may prescribe the manner in which its stock must be transferred in its bylaws or articles of association. A bank issuing stock in certificated form must comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 52, including as to:

      (i) The name and location of the bank;

      (ii) The name of the holder of record of the stock represented thereby;

      (iii) The number and class of shares which the certificate represents;

      (vi) The seal of the bank.

#### § § 7.2019

      (a)  A national bank may require a borrower holding shares of the bank to execute agreements:

      (1) Not to pledge, give away, transfer, or otherwise assign such shares;

      (2) To pledge such shares at the request of the bank when necessary to prevent loss; and

      (3) To leave such shares in the bank's custody.

      (b)  A national bank may not make loans secured by a pledge of the bank's own capital notes and debentures. Such notes and debentures must be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other creditors of the issuing bank, and are, therefore, capital instruments within the purview of 12 U.S.C. 83.

      § 7.2021   National bank preemptive rights.

#### § § 7.2021

      A national bank in its articles of association must grant or deny preemptive rights to the bank's shareholders.

      (b)  Examples of legitimate corporate purposes include a reverse stock split to:

      § 7.2025   Capital stock-related activities of a national bank.

#### § § 7.2025

      (a)  A national bank must obtain the necessary shareholder approval required by 12 U.S.C. 51a, 57, or 59 for any change in its permanent capital. An increase or decrease in the amount of a national bank's common or preferred stock is a change in permanent capital subject to the notice and approval requirements of 12 CFR 5.46 and applicable law. A national bank may obtain the required shareholder approval of changes in permanent capital, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

      (b)  In compliance with 12 U.S.C. 57, a national bank may issue common stock up to an amount previously approved and authorized in the national bank's articles of association by holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares without obtaining additional shareholder approval for each subsequent issuance within the authorized amount.

      (c)  Subject to the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 51a and 59, a national bank may adopt procedures to authorize the board of directors to issue, determine the terms of, repurchase, and redeem one or more series of preferred stock, if permitted by the corporate governance provisions adopted by the bank under § 7.2000. To satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of 12 U.S.C. 51a and 59, the adoption of such procedures must be approved by shareholders in advance through an amendment to the national bank's articles of association. Any amendment to a national bank's articles of association that authorizes both the issuance and the repurchase and redemption of shares must be approved by holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares.

      (d)  Subject to the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 59, a national bank may establish a program for the repurchase, from time to time, of the national bank's common or preferred stock, if permitted by the corporate governance provisions adopted by the bank under § 7.2000. To satisfy the shareholder approval requirement of 12 U.S.C. 59, the repurchase program must be approved in advance by the holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares, including through an amendment to the national bank's articles of association that authorizes the board of directors to repurchase the national bank's common or preferred stock from time to time under board-determined parameters that can limit the frequency, type, aggregate limit, or purchase price of repurchases.

      (e)  A national bank's preferred stock may be cumulative or non-cumulative and may or may not have voting rights on one or more series.

    Subpart C—National Bank and Federal Savings Association Operations

      § 7.3000   National bank and Federal savings association operating hours and closings.

#### § § 7.3000

      (a)  The board of directors of a national bank or Federal savings association, or an equivalent person or committee of a Federal branch or agency, should review its hours of operations for customers and, independently of any other bank, savings association, or Federal branch or agency, take appropriate action to establish a schedule of operating hours for customers.

      (b)  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 95(b)(1) and 1463(a)(1)(A), the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller), may declare any day a legal holiday if emergency conditions exist. That day is a legal holiday for national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies in the affected geographic area ( throughout the United States, in a State, or in part of a State), and national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches and agencies may temporarily limit or suspend operations at their affected offices, unless the Comptroller by written order directs otherwise. Emergency conditions may be caused by acts of nature or of man and may include natural and other disasters, public health or safety emergencies, civil and municipal emergencies, and cyber threats or other unauthorized intrusions ( severe flooding, a pandemic, terrorism, a cyber-attack on bank systems, or a power emergency declared by a local power company or government requesting that businesses in the affected area close). The Comptroller may issue a proclamation authorizing the emergency closing in anticipation of the emergency condition, at the time of the emergency condition, or soon thereafter. In the absence of a Comptroller declaration of a bank holiday, a national bank, Federal savings associations, or Federal branch or agency may choose to temporarily close offices in response to an emergency condition. The national bank, Federal savings associations, or Federal branch or agency should notify the OCC of such temporary closure as soon as feasible.

      (c)  In the event a State or a legally authorized State official declares any day to be a legal holiday for emergency or ceremonial reasons in that State or part of the State, that same day is a legal holiday for national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies or their offices in the affected geographic area. National banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies or their affected offices may close their affected offices or remain open on such a State-designated holiday, unless the Comptroller by written order directs otherwise.

      (d)  A national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency should assure that all liabilities or other obligations under the applicable law due to its closing are satisfied.

      (e)  For the purpose of this subpart, the term “State” means any of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States.

      § 7.3001   Sharing national bank or Federal association space and employees.

#### § § 7.3001

      (1) A national bank or Federal savings association employee may act as agent for the other business; or

      (2) An employee of the other business may act as agent for the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (c)  When a national bank or Federal savings association engages in arrangements of the types listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must ensure that:

      (1) The other business is conspicuously, accurately, and separately identified;

      (2) Shared employees clearly and fully disclose the nature of their agency relationship to customers of the national bank or Federal savings association and of the other businesses so that customers will know the identity of the national bank, Federal savings association, or other business that is providing the product or service;

      (3) The arrangement does not constitute a joint venture or partnership with the other business under applicable State law;

      (4) All aspects of the relationship between the national bank or Federal savings association and the other business are conducted at arm's length, unless a special arrangement is warranted because the other business is a subsidiary of the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (5) Security issues arising from the activities of the other business on the premises are addressed;

      (6) The activities of the other business do not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association;

      (7) The shared employees or the entity for which they perform services are duly licensed or meet qualification requirements of applicable statutes and regulations pertaining to agents or employees of such other business; and

      (8) The assets and records of the parties are segregated.

      (d)  When entering into arrangements of the types described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and in conducting operations pursuant to those arrangements, a national bank or Federal savings association must ensure that each arrangement complies with all applicable laws and regulations. If the arrangement involves an affiliate or a shareholder, director, officer or employee of the national bank or Federal savings association:

      (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions governing national bank or Federal savings association transactions with these persons or entities;

      (2) The parties must comply with all applicable fiduciary duties; and

      (3) The parties, if they are in competition with each other, must consider limitations, if any, imposed by applicable antitrust laws.

      (e)  If, on May 18, 2015, a Federal savings association shares space or employees with another business under an agreement that complies with the legal requirements that were in effect prior to May 18, 2015, but which would violate any provision of this section, the Federal savings association may continue sharing under the existing agreement but it may not amend, renew, or extend the agreement without prior approval of the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

    Subpart D—Preemption

      § 7.4000   Visitorial powers with respect to national banks.

#### § § 7.4000

      (a)  (1) Under 12 U.S.C. 484, only the OCC or an authorized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks. State officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law. However, production of a bank's records (other than non-public OCC information under 12 CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal judicial procedures.

      (2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers include:

      (i) Examination of a bank;

      (ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records;

      (iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and

      (iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable Federal or state laws concerning those activities, including through investigations that seek to ascertain compliance through production of non-public information by the bank, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

      (3) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, the OCC has exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the content and conduct of activities authorized for national banks under Federal law.

      (b)  In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in  v.  129 S. Ct. 2710 (2009), an action against a national bank in a court of appropriate jurisdiction brought by a state attorney general (or other chief law enforcement officer) to enforce an applicable law against a national bank and to seek relief as authorized by such law is not an exercise of visitorial powers under 12 U.S.C. 484.

      (c)  Under 12 U.S.C. 484, the OCC's exclusive visitorial powers are subject to the following exceptions:

      (1)  National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as are provided by Federal law. Examples of laws vesting visitorial power in other governmental entities include laws authorizing state or other Federal officials to:

      (i) Inspect the list of shareholders, provided that the official is authorized to assess taxes under state authority (12 U.S.C. 62; this section also authorizes inspection of the shareholder list by shareholders and creditors of a national bank);

      (ii) Review, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to a bank, the bank's records solely to ensure compliance with applicable state unclaimed property or escheat laws upon reasonable cause to believe that the bank has failed to comply with those laws (12 U.S.C. 484(b));

      (iii) Verify payroll records for unemployment compensation purposes (26 U.S.C. 3305(c));

      (iv) Ascertain the correctness of Federal tax returns (26 U.S.C. 7602);

      (v) Enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 211); and

      (vi) Functionally regulate certain activities, as provided under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (Nov. 12, 1999).

      (2)  National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as are vested in the courts of justice. This exception pertains to the powers inherent in the judiciary.

      (3)  National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as shall be, or have been, exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.

      (d)  The report of examination made by an OCC examiner is designated solely for use in the supervision of the bank. The bank's copy of the report is the property of the OCC and is loaned to the bank and any holding company thereof solely for its confidential use. The bank's directors, in keeping with their responsibilities both to depositors and to shareholders, should thoroughly review the report. The report may be made available to other persons only in accordance with the rules on disclosure in 12 CFR part 4.

      § 7.4001   Charging interest by national banks at rates permitted competing institutions; charging interest to corporate borrowers.

#### § § 7.4001

      (a)  The term “interest” as used in 12 U.S.C. 85 includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, creditor-imposed not sufficient funds (NSF) fees charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.

      (b)  A national bank located in a state may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a national bank making such loans is subject only to the provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a national bank may lawfully charge the highest rate permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of loans made by small loan companies.

      (c)  The Federal definition of the term “interest” in paragraph (a) of this section does not change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law. For example, if late fees are not “interest” under state law where a national bank is located but state law permits its most favored lender to charge late fees, then a national bank located in that state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The national bank may also charge late fees to its interstate customers because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest and an allowable charge under state law where the national bank is located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that lending institutions may charge under those limitations.

      (d)  A national bank located in a state the law of which denies the defense of usury to a corporate borrower may charge a corporate borrower any rate of interest agreed upon by a corporate borrower.

      (e)  Interest on a loan that is permissible under 12 U.S.C. 85 shall not be affected by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the loan.

      § 7.4002   National bank charges.

#### § § 7.4002

      (a)  A national bank may charge its customers non-interest charges and fees, including deposit account service charges.

      (b)  (1) All charges and fees should be arrived at by each bank on a competitive basis and not on the basis of any agreement, arrangement, undertaking, understanding, or discussion with other banks or their officers.

      (2) The establishment of non-interest charges and fees, their amounts, and the method of calculating them are business decisions to be made by each bank, in its discretion, according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles. A national bank establishes non-interest charges and fees in accordance with safe and sound banking principles if the bank employs a decision-making process through which it considers the following factors, among others:

      (i) The cost incurred by the bank in providing the service;

      (ii) The deterrence of misuse by customers of banking services;

      (iii) The enhancement of the competitive position of the bank in accordance with the bank's business plan and marketing strategy; and

      (iv) The maintenance of the safety and soundness of the institution.

      (c)  Charges and fees that are “interest” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 85 are governed by § 7.4001 and not by this section.

      (d)  The OCC applies preemption principles derived from the United States Constitution, as interpreted through judicial precedent, when determining whether State laws apply that purport to limit or prohibit charges and fees described in this section.

      (e)  This section does not apply to charges imposed by a national bank in its capacity as a fiduciary, which are governed by 12 CFR part 9.

      § 7.5002   Furnishing of products and services by electronic means and facilities.

#### § § 7.5002

      (a)  A national bank may perform, provide, or deliver through electronic means and facilities any activity, function, product, or service that it is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, subject to § 7.5001(b) and applicable OCC guidance. The following list provides examples of permissible activities under this authority. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to this authority.

      (1) Acting as an electronic finder by:

      (i) Establishing, registering, and hosting commercially enabled web sites in the name of sellers;

      (ii) Establishing hyperlinks between the bank's site and a third-party site, including acting as a “virtual mall” by providing a collection of links to web sites of third-party vendors, organized by-product type and made available to bank customers;

      (iii) Hosting an electronic marketplace on the bank's Internet web site by providing links to the web sites of third-party buyers or sellers through the use of hypertext or other similar means;

      (iv) Hosting on the bank's servers the Internet web site of:

      (A) A buyer or seller that provides information concerning the hosted party and the products or services offered or sought and allows the submission of interest, bids, offers, orders and confirmations relating to such products or services; or

      (B) A governmental entity that provides information concerning the services or benefits made available by the governmental entity, assists persons in completing applications to receive such services or benefits and permits persons to transmit their applications for such services or benefits;

      (v) Operating an Internet web site that permits numerous buyers and sellers to exchange information concerning the products and services that they are willing to purchase or sell, locate potential counter-parties for transactions, aggregate orders for goods or services with those made by other parties, and enter into transactions between themselves;

      (vi) Operating a telephone call center that provides permissible finder services; and

      (vii) Providing electronic communications services relating to all aspects of transactions between buyers and sellers;

      (2) Providing electronic bill presentment services;

      (4) Safekeeping for personal information or valuable confidential trade or business information, such as encryption keys; and

      (5) Issuing electronic letters of credit within the scope of 12 CFR 7.1016.

      (b)  When a national bank performs, provides, or delivers through electronic means and facilities an activity, function, product, or service that it is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, the electronic activity is not exempt from the regulatory requirements and supervisory guidance that the OCC would apply if the activity were conducted by non-electronic means or facilities.

      (c)  As a general rule, and except as provided by Federal law, State law is not applicable to a national bank's conduct of an authorized activity through electronic means or facilities if the State law, as applied to the activity, would be preempted pursuant to traditional principles of Federal preemption derived from the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and applicable judicial precedent. Accordingly, State laws that stand as an obstacle to the ability of national banks to exercise uniformly their Federally authorized powers through electronic means or facilities, are not applicable to national banks.

      § 7.5003   Composite authority to engage in electronic activities.

#### § § 7.5003

      Unless otherwise prohibited by Federal law, a national bank may engage in an electronic activity that is comprised of several component activities if each of the component activities is itself part of or incidental to the business of banking or is otherwise permissible under Federal law.

      § 7.5004   Sale of excess electronic capacity and by-products.

#### § § 7.5004

      (a) A national bank may, in order to optimize the use of the bank's resources or avoid economic loss or waste, market and sell to third parties electronic capacities legitimately acquired or developed by the bank for its banking business.

      (b) With respect to acquired equipment or facilities, legitimate excess electronic capacity that may be sold to others can arise in a variety of situations, including the following:

      (1) Due to the characteristics of the desired equipment or facilities available in the market, the capacity of the most practical optimal equipment or facilities available to meet the bank's requirements exceeds its present needs;

      (2) The acquisition and retention of additional capacity, beyond present needs, reasonably may be necessary for planned future expansion or to meet the expected future banking needs during the useful life of the equipment;

      (3) Requirements for capacity fluctuate because a bank engages in batch processing of banking transactions or because a bank must have capacity to meet peak period demand with the result that the bank has periods when its capacity is underutilized; and

      (4) After the initial acquisition of capacity thought to be fully needed for banking operations, the bank experiences either a decline in level of the banking operations or an increase in the efficiency of the banking operations using that capacity.

      (c) Types of electronic capacity in equipment or facilities that banks may have legitimately acquired and that may be sold to third parties if excess to the bank's needs for banking purposes include:

      (1) Data processing services;

      (2) Production and distribution of non-financial software;

      (3) Providing periodic back-up call answering services;

      (4) Providing full Internet access;

      (5) Providing electronic security system support services;

      (6) Providing long line communications services; and

      (7) Electronic imaging and storage.

      (d) A national bank may sell to third parties electronic by-products legitimately acquired or developed by the bank for its banking business. Examples of electronic by-products that banks may have legitimately acquired that may be sold to third parties if excess to the bank's needs include:

      (1) Software acquired (not merely licensed) or developed by the bank for banking purposes or to support its banking business; and

      (2) Electronic databases, records, or media (such as electronic images) developed by the bank for or during the performance of its permissible data processing activities.

      § 7.5005   National bank acting as digital certification authority.

#### § § 7.5005

      (a) It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to act as a certificate authority and to issue digital certificates verifying the identity of persons associated with a particular public/private key pair. As part of this service, the bank may also maintain a listing or repository of public keys.

      (b) A national bank may issue digital certificates verifying attributes in addition to identity of persons associated with a particular public/private key pair where the attribute is one for which verification is part of or incidental to the business of banking. For example, national banks may issue digital certificates verifying certain financial attributes of a customer as of the current or a previous date, such as account balance as of a particular date, lines of credit as of a particular date, past financial performance of the customer, and verification of customer relationship with the bank as of a particular date.

      (c) When a national bank issues a digital certificate relating to financial capacity under this section, the bank shall include in that certificate an express disclaimer stating that the bank does not thereby promise or represent that funds will be available or will be advanced for any particular transaction.

      § 7.5006   Data processing.

#### § § 7.5006

      (a)  It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to provide data processing, and data transmission services, facilities (including equipment, technology, and personnel), data bases, advice and access to such services, facilities, data bases and advice, for itself and for others, where the data is banking, financial, or economic data, and other types of data if the derivative or resultant product is banking, financial, or economic data. For this purpose, economic data includes anything of value in banking and financial decisions.

      (b)  A national bank also may perform the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section for itself and others with respect to additional types of data to the extent convenient or useful to provide the data processing services described in paragraph (a), including where reasonably necessary to conduct those activities on a competitive basis. The total revenue attributable to the bank's data processing activities under this section must be derived predominantly from processing the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c)  A national bank may produce, market, or sell software that performs services or functions that the bank could perform directly, as part of the business of banking.

      § 7.5008   Location of a national bank conducting electronic activities.

#### § § 7.5008

      A national bank shall not be considered located in a State solely because it physically maintains technology, such as a server or automated loan center, in that state, or because the bank's products or services are accessed through electronic means by customers located in the state.

      § 7.5009   Location under 12 U.S.C. 85 of national banks operating exclusively through the Internet.

#### § § 7.5009

    § 8.2   Semiannual assessment.

#### § § 8.2

    (a) Each national bank and each Federal savings association shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each national bank and each Federal savings association no later than 7 business days prior to collection on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In setting assessments, the OCC may take into account the nature and scope of the activities of a national bank or Federal savings association, the amount and type of assets that the entity holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor the OCC determines is appropriate, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 16. The semiannual assessment will be calculated as follows:

    (1) Every national bank and every Federal savings association falls into one of the asset-size brackets denoted by Columns A and B. A national bank's or Federal savings association's semiannual assessment is composed of two parts. The first part is the calculation of a base amount of the assessment, which is computed on the assets of the national bank or Federal savings association up to the lower endpoint (Column A) of the bracket in which it falls. This base amount of the assessment is calculated by the OCC in Column C.

    (2) The second part is the calculation of assessments due on the remaining assets of the national bank or Federal savings association in excess of Column E. The excess is assessed at the marginal rate shown in Column D.

    (3) The total semiannual assessment is the amount in Column C, plus the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's assets in excess of Column E times the marginal rate in Column D:

    (4) Each year, the OCC may index the marginal rates in Column D to adjust for the percent change in the level of prices, as measured by changes in the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator (GDPIPD) for each June-to-June period. The OCC may at its discretion adjust marginal rates by amounts other than the percentage change in the GDPIPD. The OCC will also adjust the amounts in Column C to reflect any change made to the marginal rate.

    (5)(i) The specific marginal rates and complete assessment schedule will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” provided for at § 8.8. Each semiannual assessment is based upon the total assets shown in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent “Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (Call Report) preceding the payment date. Each national bank or Federal savings association subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second or fourth quarterly Call Report as appropriate, required by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 161 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. National banks and Federal savings associations that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (6)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead national bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.

    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6):

    (A)  or  means the largest national bank or Federal savings association controlled by a company, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each national bank or Federal savings association controlled by that company as reported in each national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.

    (B)  or  means a national bank or Federal savings association that is not the lead national bank or lead Federal savings association controlled by a company that controls two or more national banks or Federal savings associations.

    (C)  and  with respect to national banks have the same meanings as these terms have in sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b), respectively, of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2) and (b)).

    (D)  and  with respect to Federal savings associations have the same meanings as these terms have in section 10(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(a).

    (b)(1) Each Federal branch and each Federal agency shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each Federal branch and agency no later than 7 business days prior to March 31 and September 30 of each year.

    (2) The amount of the semiannual assessment paid by each Federal branch and Federal agency shall be computed at the same rate as provided in the Table in 12 CFR 8.2(a); however, only the total domestic assets of the Federal branch or agency shall be subject to assessment.

    (3)(i) Each semiannual assessment of each Federal branch and each agency is based upon the total assets shown in the Federal branch's or agency's Call Report most recently preceding the payment date. Each Federal branch or agency subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second and fourth Call Reports is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. Federal branches and agencies that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (4)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead Federal branch and agency by an amount that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.

    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4):

    (A)  means the largest Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each Federal branch or agency of that foreign bank as reported in each Federal branch's or agency's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.

    (B)  means a Federal branch or agency that is not the lead Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank that controls two or more Federal branches or agencies.

    (c) —(1)  In addition to the assessment calculated according to paragraph (a) of this section, each independent credit card national bank and independent credit card Federal savings association will pay an assessment based on receivables attributable to credit card accounts owned by the national bank or Federal savings association. This assessment will be computed by adding to its asset-based assessment an additional amount determined by its level of receivables attributable. The dollar amount of the additional assessment will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” described at § 8.8.

    (2)  The OCC will assess an independent credit card national bank and an independent credit card Federal savings association in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, notwithstanding that the national bank or Federal savings association is affiliated with a full-service national bank or full-service Federal savings association, if the OCC concludes that the affiliation is intended to evade this part.

    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following definitions apply:

    (i)  with respect to national banks, has the same meaning as this term has in 12 U.S.C. 221a(b).

    (ii)  with respect to Federal savings associations, has the same meaning as in 12 U.S.C. 1462(9).

    (iii)  means a bank described in section 2(c)(2)(F) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1841(c)(2)(F)) or a national bank or a Federal savings association whose ratio of total gross receivables attributable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet assets exceeds 50%.

    (iv)  is a national bank that generates more than 50% of its interest and non-interest income from activities other than credit card operations or trust activities and is authorized according to its charter to engage in all types of permissible banking activities.

    (v)  is a Federal savings association that generates more than 50% of its interest and non-interest income from activities other than credit card operations or trust activities and is authorized according to its charter to engage in all types of activities permissible for Federal savings associations.

    (vi)  is a national bank that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service national bank.

    (vii)  is a Federal savings association that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service Federal savings association.

    (viii)  is the total amount of outstanding balances due on credit card accounts owned by an independent credit card national bank or an independent credit card Federal savings association (the receivables attributable to those accounts) on the last day of the assessment period, minus receivables retained on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet as of that day.

    (4)  Independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations will report receivables attributable data to the OCC semiannually at a time specified by the OCC.

    (d)  Subject to any limit that the OCC prescribes in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” the OCC shall apply a surcharge to the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. This surcharge will be determined by multiplying the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section by—

    (1) 1.5, in the case of any national bank or Federal savings association that receives a composite rating of 3 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS) and any Federal branch or agency that receives a composite rating of 3 under the ROCA rating system (which rates risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) at its most recent examination prior to December 31 or June 30, as appropriate; and

    (2) 2.0, in the case of any national bank or Federal savings association that receives a composite UFIRS rating of 4 or 5 and any Federal branch or agency that receives a composite rating of 4 or 5 under the ROCA rating system at its most recent examination prior to December 31 or June 30, as appropriate.

    (3) Conducting special examinations and investigations of an entity with respect to its performance of activities described in section 7(c) of the Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1867(c)) if the OCC determines that assessment of the fee is warranted with regard to a particular national bank, Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, or Federal savings association because of the high risk or unusual nature of the activities performed; the significance to the national bank's, Federal branch's or agency's, or Federal saving association's operations and income of the activities performed; or the extent to which the national bank, Federal branch or agency, or Federal savings association has sufficient systems, controls, and personnel to adequately monitor, measure, and control risks arising from such activities;

    (c) —(1)  The assessment of independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will include a fiduciary and related asset component, in addition to the assessment calculated according to § 8.2 of this part, as follows:

    (i)  All independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will pay a minimum fee, to be provided in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments.”

    (ii)  Independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations with fiduciary and related assets in excess of $1 billion will pay an amount that exceeds the minimum fee.

#### § § 8.7

    (a) Each national bank, Federal savings association, Federal branch, and Federal agency shall pay to the OCC interest on its delinquent payments of semiannual assessments. In addition, each institution subject to a special examination or investigation fee shall pay to the OCC interest on its delinquent payments of special examination and investigation fees. Semiannual assessment payments will be considered delinquent if they are received after the time for payment specified in § 8.2. Special examination and investigation fees will be considered delinquent if not received by the OCC within 30 calendar days of the invoice date.

    (b) In the event that an institution believes that the notice of assessments or special examination and investigation fees contains an error or miscalculation, the institution may provide the OCC with a written request for a revised notice and a refund of any overpayments. Any such request for a revised notice and refund must be made after timely payment of the semiannual assessment under the dates specified in § 8.2 or timely payment of the special examination and investigation fee within 30 calendar days of the invoice date.

    (1) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of such request, the OCC shall either—

    (i) Refund the amount of the overpayment; or

    (ii) Provide notice of its unwillingness to accept the request for a revised notice of assessments. In the latter instance, the OCC and the entity claiming the overpayment shall thereafter attempt to reach agreement on the amount, if any, to be refunded; the OCC shall refund this amount within 30 calendar days of such agreement.

    (2) The OCC shall be considered delinquent if it fails to return an overpayment in accordance with the time limitations specified in this paragraph (b). The OCC shall pay interest on any such delinquent payments.

    (c) Interest on delinquent payments, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, will be assessed beginning the first calendar day on which payment is considered delinquent, and on each calendar day thereafter up to and including the day payment is received. Interest will be simple interest, calculated for each day payment is delinquent by multiplying the daily equivalent of the applicable interest rate by the amount delinquent. The rate of interest will be the United States Treasury Department's current value of funds rate (the “TFRM rate”); that rate is issued under the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual and is published quarterly in the  The interest rates applicable to a delinquent payment will be determined as follows:

    (1) For delinquent days occurring from January 1 to March 31, the rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding December for the first quarter of the ensuing year.

    (2) For delinquent days occurring from April 1 to June 30, the rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding March for the second quarter of that year.

### Part 9

**Authority:** Authority: 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 92a, and 93a; 15 U.S.C. 78q, 78q-1, and 78w.

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 68554, Dec. 30, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

    Regulations

      § 9.1   Authority, purpose, and scope.

#### § § 9.1

      (a)  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issues this part pursuant to its authority under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 92a, and 93a, and 15 U.S.C. 78q, 78q-1, and 78w.

      (b)  The purpose of this part is to set forth the standards that apply to the fiduciary activities of national banks.

      (c)  This part applies to all national banks that act in a fiduciary capacity, as defined in § 9.2(e). This part also applies to all Federal branches of foreign banks to the same extent as it applies to national banks.

      § 9.2   Definitions.

#### § § 9.2

      For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

      (a)  has the same meaning as in 12 U.S.C. 221a(b).

      (b)  means the law of a state or other jurisdiction governing a national bank's fiduciary relationships, any applicable Federal law governing those relationships, the terms of the instrument governing a fiduciary relationship, or any court order pertaining to the relationship.

      (c)  means a fiduciary relationship established pursuant to a state law substantially similar to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act as published by the American Law Institute.

      (d)  means an account administered by a national bank acting in a fiduciary capacity.

      (e)  means: trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, transfer agent, guardian, assignee, receiver, or custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act; investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice; any capacity in which the bank possesses investment discretion on behalf of another; or any other similar capacity that the OCC authorizes pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a.

      (f)  means all officers and employees of a national bank to whom the board of directors or its designee has assigned functions involving the exercise of the bank's fiduciary powers.

      (g)  means the authority the OCC permits a national bank to exercise pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a.

      (h)  means the guardian or conservator, by whatever name used by state law, of the estate of a minor, an incompetent person, an absent person, or a person over whose estate a court has taken jurisdiction, other than under bankruptcy or insolvency laws.

      (i)  means, with respect to an account, the sole or shared authority (whether or not that authority is exercised) to determine what securities or other assets to purchase or sell on behalf of the account. A bank that delegates its authority over investments and a bank that receives delegated authority over investments are both deemed to have investment discretion.

      (j)  means an office of a national bank, other than a main office or a branch, at which the bank engages in one or more of the activities specified in § 9.7(d). Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 36(j), a trust office is not a “branch” for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36, unless it is also an office at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.

      (k)  means an office of a national bank, other than a main office, branch, or trust office, at which the bank performs activities ancillary to its fiduciary business, but does not engage in any of the activities specified in § 9.7(d). Examples of ancillary activities include advertising, marketing, and soliciting for fiduciary business; contacting existing or potential customers, answering questions, and providing information about matters related to their accounts; acting as a liaison between the trust office and the customer ( forwarding requests for distribution or changes in investment objectives, or forwarding forms and funds received from the customer); inspecting or maintaining custody of fiduciary assets or holding title to real property. This list is illustrative and not comprehensive. Other activities may also be “ancillary activities” for the purposes of this definition. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 36(j), a trust representative office is not a “branch” for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36, unless it is also an office at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.

      § 9.3   Approval requirements.

#### § § 9.3

      (a) A national bank may not exercise fiduciary powers unless it obtains prior approval from the OCC to the extent required under 12 CFR 5.26.

      (b) A national bank that has obtained the OCC s approval to exercise fiduciary powers is not required to obtain the OCC s prior approval to engage in any of the activities specified in § 9.7(d) in a new state or to conduct, in a new state, activities that are ancillary to its fiduciary business. Instead, the national bank must follow the notice procedures prescribed by 12 CFR 5.26(e).

      (c) A person seeking approval to organize a special-purpose national bank limited to fiduciary powers shall file an application with the OCC pursuant to 12 CFR 5.20.

      § 9.4   Administration of fiduciary powers.

#### § § 9.4

      (a)  A national bank's fiduciary activities shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors. In discharging its responsibilities, the board may assign any function related to the exercise of fiduciary powers to any director, officer, employee, or committee thereof.

      (b)  The national bank may use any qualified personnel and facilities of the bank or its affiliates to perform services related to the exercise of its fiduciary powers, and any department of the bank or its affiliates may use fiduciary officers, employees, and facilities to perform services unrelated to the exercise of fiduciary powers, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law.

      (c)  Pursuant to a written agreement, a national bank exercising fiduciary powers may perform services related to the exercise of fiduciary powers for another bank or other entity, and may purchase services related to the exercise of fiduciary powers from another bank or other entity.

      (d)  A national bank shall ensure that all fiduciary officers and employees are adequately bonded.

      § 9.5   Policies and procedures.

#### § § 9.5

      A national bank exercising fiduciary powers shall adopt and follow written policies and procedures adequate to maintain its fiduciary activities in compliance with applicable law. Among other relevant matters, the policies and procedures should address, where appropriate, the bank's:

      (a) Brokerage placement practices;

      (b) Methods for ensuring that fiduciary officers and employees do not use material inside information in connection with any decision or recommendation to purchase or sell any security;

      (c) Methods for preventing self-dealing and conflicts of interest;

      (d) Selection and retention of legal counsel who is readily available to advise the bank and its fiduciary officers and employees on fiduciary matters; and

      (e) Investment of funds held as fiduciary, including short-term investments and the treatment of fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution.

      § 9.6   Review of fiduciary accounts.

#### § § 9.6

      (a)  Before accepting a fiduciary account, a national bank shall review the prospective account to determine whether it can properly administer the account.

      (b)  Upon the acceptance of a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion, the bank shall conduct a prompt review of all assets of the account to evaluate whether they are appropriate for the account.

      (c)  At least once during every calendar year, a bank shall conduct a review of all assets of each fiduciary account for which the bank has investment discretion to evaluate whether they are appropriate, individually and collectively, for the account.

      § 9.7   Multi-state fiduciary operations.

#### § § 9.7

      (a)  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a and this section, a national bank may act in a fiduciary capacity in any state. If a national bank acts, or proposes to act, in a fiduciary capacity in a particular state, the bank may act in the following specific capacities:

      (1) Any of the eight fiduciary capacities expressly listed in 12 U.S.C. 92a(a), unless the state prohibits its own state banks, trust companies, and other corporations that compete with national banks in that state from acting in that capacity; and

      (2) Any other fiduciary capacity the state permits for its own state banks, trust companies, or other corporations that compete with national banks in that state.

      (b)  While acting in a fiduciary capacity in one state, a national bank may market its fiduciary services to, and act as fiduciary for, customers located in any state, and it may act as fiduciary for relationships that include property located in other states. The bank may use a trust representative office for this purpose.

      (c)  A national bank with fiduciary powers may establish trust offices or trust representative offices in any state.

      (d)  For each fiduciary relationship, the state referred to in section 92a is the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for that relationship. A national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in the state in which it accepts the fiduciary appointment, executes the documents that create the fiduciary relationship, and makes discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary assets. If these activities take place in more than one state, then the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for section 92a purposes is the state that the bank designates from among those states.

      (e) —(1)  The state laws that apply to a national bank's fiduciary activities by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a are the laws of the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity.

      (2)  Except for the state laws made applicable to national banks by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a, state laws limiting or establishing preconditions on the exercise of fiduciary powers are not applicable to national banks.

> [66 FR 34798, July 2, 2001]

      § 9.8   Recordkeeping.

#### § § 9.8

      (a)  A national bank shall adequately document the establishment and termination of each fiduciary account and shall maintain adequate records for all fiduciary accounts.

      (b)  A national bank shall retain records described in paragraph (a) of this section for a period of three years from the later of the termination of the account or the termination of any litigation relating to the account.

      (c)  A national bank shall ensure that records described in paragraph (a) of this section are separate and distinct from other records of the bank.

      § 9.9   Audit of fiduciary activities.

#### § § 9.9

      (a)  At least once during each calendar year, a national bank shall arrange for a suitable audit (by internal or external auditors) of all significant fiduciary activities, under the direction of its fiduciary audit committee, unless the bank adopts a continuous audit system in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The bank shall note the results of the audit (including significant actions taken as a result of the audit) in the minutes of the board of directors.

      (b)  In lieu of performing annual audits under paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may adopt a continuous audit system under which the bank arranges for a discrete audit (by internal or external auditors) of each significant fiduciary activity ( on an activity-by-activity basis), under the direction of its fiduciary audit committee, at an interval commensurate with the nature and risk of that activity. Thus, certain fiduciary activities may receive audits at intervals greater or less than one year, as appropriate. A bank that adopts a continuous audit system shall note the results of all discrete audits performed since the last audit report (including significant actions taken as a result of the audits) in the minutes of the board of directors at least once during each calendar year .

      (c)  A national bank's fiduciary audit committee must consist of a committee of the bank's directors or an audit committee of an affiliate of the bank. However, in either case, the committee:

      (1) Must not include any officers of the bank or an affiliate who participate significantly in the administration of the bank's fiduciary activities; and

      (2) Must consist of a majority of members who are not also members of any committee to which the board of directors has delegated power to manage and control the fiduciary activities of the bank.

      § 9.10   Fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution.

#### § § 9.10

      (a)  With respect to a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion or discretion over distributions, the bank may not allow funds awaiting investment or distribution to remain uninvested and undistributed any longer than is reasonable for the proper management of the account and consistent with applicable law. With respect to a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion, the bank shall obtain for funds awaiting investment or distribution a rate of return that is consistent with applicable law.

      (b) —(1)  A national bank may deposit funds of a fiduciary account that are awaiting investment or distribution in the commercial, savings, or another department of the bank, unless prohibited by applicable law. To the extent that the funds are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank shall set aside collateral as security, under the control of appropriate fiduciary officers and employees, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The market value of the collateral set aside must at all times equal or exceed the amount of the uninsured fiduciary funds.

      (2)  A national bank may satisfy the collateral requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section with any of the following:

      (i) Direct obligations of the United States, or other obligations fully guaranteed by the United States as to principal and interest;

      (ii) Securities that qualify as eligible for investment by national banks pursuant to 12 CFR part 1;

      (iii) Readily marketable securities of the classes in which state banks, trust companies, or other corporations exercising fiduciary powers are permitted to invest fiduciary funds under applicable state law;

      (iv) Surety bonds, to the extent they provide adequate security, unless prohibited by applicable law; and

      (v) Any other assets that qualify under applicable state law as appropriate security for deposits of fiduciary funds.

      (c)  A national bank, acting in its fiduciary capacity, may deposit funds of a fiduciary account that are awaiting investment or distribution with an affiliated insured depository institution, unless prohibited by applicable law. A national bank may set aside collateral as security for a deposit by or with an affiliate of fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution, unless prohibited by applicable law.

      § 9.11   Investment of fiduciary funds.

      § 9.12   Self-dealing and conflicts of interest.

#### § § 9.12

      (a) —(1)  Unless authorized by applicable law, a national bank may not invest funds of a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion in the stock or obligations of, or in assets acquired from: the bank or any of its directors, officers, or employees; affiliates of the bank or any of their directors, officers, or employees; or individuals or organizations with whom there exists an interest that might affect the exercise of the best judgment of the bank.

      (2)  If retention of stock or obligations of the bank or its affiliates in a fiduciary account is consistent with applicable law, the bank may:

      (i) Exercise rights to purchase additional stock (or securities convertible into additional stock) when offered pro rata to stockholders; and

      (ii) Purchase fractional shares to complement fractional shares acquired through the exercise of rights or the receipt of a stock dividend resulting in fractional share holdings.

      (b) —(1)  A national bank may not lend, sell, or otherwise transfer assets of a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion to the bank or any of its directors, officers, or employees, or to affiliates of the bank or any of their directors, officers, or employees, or to individuals or organizations with whom there exists an interest that might affect the exercise of the best judgment of the bank, unless:

      (i) The transaction is authorized by applicable law;

      (ii) Legal counsel advises the bank in writing that the bank has incurred, in its fiduciary capacity, a contingent or potential liability, in which case the bank, upon the sale or transfer of assets, shall reimburse the fiduciary account in cash at the greater of book or market value of the assets;

      (iii) As provided in § 9.18(b)(8)(iii) for defaulted investments; or

      (iv) Required in writing by the OCC.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a national bank may not lend to any of its directors, officers, or employees any funds held in trust, except with respect to employee benefit plans in accordance with the exemptions found in section 408 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1108).

      (c)  A national bank may make a loan to a fiduciary account and may hold a security interest in assets of the account if the transaction is fair to the account and is not prohibited by applicable law.

      (d)  A national bank may sell assets between any of its fiduciary accounts if the transaction is fair to both accounts and is not prohibited by applicable law.

      (e)  A national bank may make a loan between any of its fiduciary accounts if the transaction is fair to both accounts and is not prohibited by applicable law.

      § 9.13   Custody of fiduciary assets.

#### § § 9.13

      (a)  A national bank shall place assets of fiduciary accounts in the joint custody or control of not fewer than two of the fiduciary officers or employees designated for that purpose by the board of directors. A national bank may maintain the investments of a fiduciary account off-premises, if consistent with applicable law and if the bank maintains adequate safeguards and controls. A bank that is deemed a fiduciary based solely on its capacity as investment advisor, as that capacity is defined in § 9.101(a), and has no other fiduciary capacity as enumerated in § 9.2(e) is not required to serve as custodian when offering those fiduciary services.

      (b)  A national bank shall keep the assets of fiduciary accounts separate from the assets of the bank. A national bank shall keep the assets of each fiduciary account separate from all other accounts or shall identify the investments as the property of a particular account, except as provided in § 9.18.

      § 9.14   Deposit of securities with state authorities.

#### § § 9.14

      (a)  If state law requires corporations acting in a fiduciary capacity to deposit securities with state authorities for the protection of private or court trusts, then before a national bank acts as a private or court-appointed trustee in that state, it shall make a similar deposit with state authorities. If the state authorities refuse to accept the deposit, the bank shall deposit the securities with the Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank of the district in which the national bank is located, to be held for the protection of private or court trusts to the same extent as if the securities had been deposited with state authorities.

      (b)  If a national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state, the bank may compute the amount of securities that are required to be deposited for each state on the basis of the amount of assets for which the bank is acting in a fiduciary capacity at offices located in that state. If state law requires a deposit of securities on a basis other than assets ( a requirement to deposit a fixed amount or an amount equal to a percentage of capital), the bank may compute the amount of deposit required in that state on a pro-rated basis, according to the proportion of fiduciary assets for which the bank is acting in a fiduciary capacity at offices located in that state.

      § 9.15   Fiduciary compensation.

#### § § 9.15

      (a)  If the amount of a national bank's compensation for acting in a fiduciary capacity is not set or governed by applicable law, the bank may charge a reasonable fee for its services.

      (b)  A national bank may not permit any officer or employee to retain any compensation for acting as a co-fiduciary with the bank in the administration of a fiduciary account, except with the specific approval of the bank's board of directors.

      § 9.16   Receivership or voluntary liquidation of bank.

#### § § 9.16

      If the OCC appoints a receiver for an uninsured national bank, or if a national bank places itself in voluntary liquidation, the receiver or liquidating agent shall promptly close or transfer to a substitute fiduciary all fiduciary accounts, in accordance with OCC instructions and the orders of the court having jurisdiction.

      § 9.17   Surrender or revocation of fiduciary powers.

#### § § 9.17

      (a)  In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 92a(j), a national bank seeking to surrender its fiduciary powers shall file with the OCC a certified copy of the resolution of its board of directors evidencing that intent. If, after appropriate investigation, the OCC is satisfied that the bank has been discharged from all fiduciary duties, the OCC will provide written notice that the bank is no longer authorized to exercise fiduciary powers.

      (b)  If the OCC determines that a national bank has unlawfully or unsoundly exercised, or has failed for a period of five consecutive years to exercise its fiduciary powers, the Comptroller may, in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 92a(k), revoke the bank's fiduciary powers.

      (2) A fund consisting solely of assets of retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock bonus or other trusts that are exempt from Federal income tax.

      (i) A national bank may invest assets of retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, or other trusts exempt from Federal income tax and that the bank holds in its capacity as trustee in a collective investment fund established under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.

      (ii) A national bank may invest assets of retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, or other employee benefit trusts exempt from Federal income tax and that the bank holds in any capacity (including agent), in a collective investment fund established under this paragraph (a)(2) if the fund itself qualifies for exemption from Federal income tax.

      (b)  A national bank administering a collective investment fund authorized under paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with the following requirements:

      (1)  The bank shall establish and maintain each collective investment fund in accordance with a written plan (Plan) approved by a resolution of the bank's board of directors or by a committee authorized by the board. The bank shall make a copy of the Plan available either for public inspection at its main office during all banking hours or on its Web site and shall provide a written or electronic copy of the Plan to any person who requests it. The Plan must contain appropriate provisions, not inconsistent with this part, regarding the manner in which the bank will operate the fund, including provisions relating to:

      (i) Investment powers and policies with respect to the fund;

      (ii) Allocation of income, profits, and losses;

      (ix) Amount of time following a valuation date during which the valuation must be made;

      (x) Bases upon which the bank may terminate the fund; and

      (xi) Any other matters necessary to define clearly the rights of participating accounts.

      (2)  A bank administering a collective investment fund shall have exclusive management thereof, except as a prudent person might delegate responsibilities to others.

      (3)  Each participating account in a collective investment fund must have a proportionate interest in all the fund's assets.

      (4) —(i)  A bank administering a collective investment fund shall determine the value of the fund's readily marketable assets at least once every three months. A bank shall determine the value of the fund's assets that are not readily marketable at least once a year.

      (ii)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, a bank shall value each fund asset at mark-to-market value as of the date set for valuation, unless the bank cannot readily ascertain mark-to-market value, in which case the bank shall use a fair value determined in good faith.

      (iii)  A bank may value a STIF's assets on a cost basis, rather than mark-to-market value as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, for purposes of admissions and withdrawals, if the Plan includes appropriate provisions, consistent with this part, requiring the STIF to:

      (A) Operate with a stable net asset value of $1.00 per participating interest as a primary fund objective;

      (B) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity of 120 days or less as determined in the same manner as is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 2a-7 for money market mutual funds (17 CFR 270.2a-7);

      (C) Accrue on a straight-line or amortized basis the difference between the cost and anticipated principal receipt on maturity;

      (D) Hold the STIF's assets until maturity under usual circumstances;

      (E) Adopt portfolio and issuer qualitative standards and concentration restrictions;

      (F) Adopt liquidity standards that include provisions to address contingency funding needs;

      (G) Adopt shadow pricing procedures that:

      () Require the bank to calculate the extent of difference, if any, of the mark-to-market net asset value per participating interest using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) from the STIF's amortized cost price per participating interest, at least on a calendar week basis and more frequently as determined by the bank when market conditions warrant; and

      () Require the bank, in the event the difference calculated pursuant to this subparagraph exceeds $0.005 per participating interest, to take action to reduce dilution of participating interests or other unfair results to participating accounts in the STIF;

      (H) Adopt procedures for stress testing the STIF's ability to maintain a stable net asset value per participating interest that shall provide for:

      () The periodic stress testing, at least on a calendar month basis and at such intervals as an independent risk manager or a committee responsible for the STIF's oversight that consists of members independent from the STIF's investment management determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions;

      () Stress testing based upon hypothetical events that include, but are not limited to, a change in short-term interest rates, an increase in participant account withdrawals, a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities, and the widening or narrowing of spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark the STIF has selected for overnight interest rates and commercial paper and other types of securities held by the STIF;

      () A stress testing report on the results of such testing to be provided to the independent risk manager or the committee responsible for the STIF's oversight that consists of members independent from the STIF's investment management that shall include: the date(s) on which the testing was performed; the magnitude of each hypothetical event that would cause the difference between the STIF's mark-to-market net asset value calculated using available market quotations (or appropriate substitutes which reflect current market conditions) and its net asset value per participating interest calculated using amortized cost to exceed $0.005; and an assessment by the bank of the STIF's ability to withstand the events (and concurrent occurrences of those events) that are reasonably likely to occur within the following year; and

      () Reporting adverse stress testing results to the bank's senior risk management that is independent from the STIF's investment management.

      (I) Adopt procedures that require a bank to disclose to STIF participants and to the OCC's Asset Management Group, Credit & Market Risk Division, within five business days after each calendar month-end, the fund's total assets under management (securities and other assets including cash, minus liabilities); the fund's mark-to-market and amortized cost net asset values both with and without capital support agreements; the dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity; the dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity of the STIF as of the last business day of the prior calendar month; and for each security held by the STIF as of the last business day of the prior calendar month:

      () The name of the issuer;

      () The category of investment;

      () The Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number or other standard identifier;

      () The principal amount;

      () The maturity date for purposes of calculating dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity;

      () The final legal maturity date (taking into account any maturity date extensions that may be effected at the option of the issuer) if different from the maturity date for purposes of calculating dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity;

      () The coupon or yield; and

      () The amortized cost value;

      (J) Adopt procedures that require a bank that administers a STIF to notify the OCC's Asset Management Group, Credit & Market Risk Division, prior to or within one business day thereafter of the following:

      () Any difference exceeding $0.0025 between the net asset value and the mark-to-market value of a STIF participating interest as calculated using the method set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(G)(_1_) of this section;

      () When a STIF has re-priced its net asset value below $0.995 per participating interest;

      () Any withdrawal distribution-in-kind of the STIF's participating interests or segregation of portfolio participants;

      () Any delays or suspensions in honoring STIF participating interest withdrawal requests;

      () Any decision to formally approve the liquidation, segregation of assets or portfolios, or some other liquidation of the STIF; or

      () In those situations when a bank, its affiliate, or any other entity provides a STIF financial support, including a cash infusion, a credit extension, a purchase of a defaulted or illiquid asset, or any other form of financial support in order to maintain a stable net asset value per participating interest;

      (K) Adopt procedures that in the event a STIF has re-priced its net asset value below $0.995 per participating interest, the bank administering the STIF shall calculate, admit, and withdraw the STIF's participating interests at a price based on the mark-to-market net asset value; and

      (L) Adopt procedures that, in the event a bank suspends or limits withdrawals and initiates liquidation of the STIF as a result of redemptions, require the bank to:

      () Determine that the extent of the difference between the STIF's amortized cost per participating interest and its mark-to-market net asset value per participating interest may result in material dilution of participating interests or other unfair results to participating accounts;

      () Formally approve the liquidation of the STIF; and

      () Facilitate the fair and orderly liquidation of the STIF to the benefit of all STIF participants.

      (iv)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, during periods of market stress negatively affecting, on a temporary basis, the ability of banks to operate STIFs in compliance with the requirements of the paragraph:

      (A) The OCC may issue an administrative order specifying, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, temporary revisions to the length of the dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity requirement, the length of dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity, and the manner of determining such limits;

      (B) A bank seeking to comply with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) will be deemed to be in compliance with that paragraph's requirements by complying with the limits or other revisions, and any applicable conditions, described in the administrative order; and

      (C) The OCC will publish the administrative order on  and through other methods, as appropriate.

      (5) —(i)  A bank administering a collective investment fund shall admit an account to or withdraw an account from the fund only on the basis of the valuation described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (ii)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may admit an account to or withdraw an account from a collective investment fund only if the bank has approved a request for or a notice of intention of taking that action on or before the valuation date on which the admission or withdrawal is based. No requests or notices may be canceled or countermanded after the valuation date.

      (iii)  (A) A bank administering a collective investment fund described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is invested primarily in real estate or other assets that are not readily marketable may require a prior notice period, not to exceed one year, for withdrawals.

      (B) A bank that requires a prior notice period for withdrawals must withdraw an account from the fund within the prior notice period or, if permissible under the fund's written plan, within one year after the date on which notice was required, except as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section.

      (C) A bank may withdraw an account from the fund up to one year after the withdrawal period described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, with the OCC's approval, provided that the following conditions are met:

      () The fund's written plan, including its notice and withdrawal policy, authorizes an extended withdrawal period and is fully disclosed to fund participants;

      () The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, determines that, due to unanticipated and severe market conditions for specific assets held by the fund, an extended withdrawal period is necessary in order to preserve the value of the fund's assets for the benefit of fund participants;

      () The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, determines that the extended withdrawal period is consistent with 12 CFR part 9 and applicable law;

      () The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, represents that the bank will act upon any withdrawal request as soon as practicable and consistent with its fiduciary duties; and

      () Any other condition imposed by the OCC, if the OCC determines that the condition is necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of fund participants.

      (D) Upon request by a bank, the OCC may approve an extension beyond the one-year extension period described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section if the OCC determines that the bank has made a good faith effort to satisfy withdrawal requests and the bank has been unable to satisfy such requests without causing harm to participants due to ongoing severe market conditions. The bank must also continue to satisfy the conditions described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section. Extensions under this paragraph must be requested and approved annually, for a maximum of two years after the initial one-year extension period.

      (iv)  A bank administering a collective investment fund shall make distributions to accounts withdrawing from the fund in cash, ratably in kind, a combination of cash and ratably in kind, or in any other manner consistent with applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund.

      (v)  If an investment is withdrawn in kind from a collective investment fund for the benefit of all participants in the fund at the time of the withdrawal but the investment is not distributed ratably in kind, the bank shall segregate and administer it for the benefit ratably of all participants in the collective investment fund at the time of withdrawal.

      (6) —(i)  At least once during each 12-month period, a bank administering a collective investment fund shall arrange for an audit of the collective investment fund by auditors responsible only to the board of directors of the bank.

      (ii)  At least once during each 12-month period, a bank administering a collective investment fund shall prepare a financial report of the fund based on the audit required by paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. The report must disclose the fund's fees and expenses in a manner consistent with applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund. This report must contain a list of investments in the fund showing the cost and current market value of each investment, and a statement covering the period after the previous report showing the following (organized by type of investment):

      (A) A summary of purchases (with costs);

      (B) A summary of sales (with profit or loss and any other investment changes);

      (C) Income and disbursements; and

      (D) An appropriate notation of any investments in default.

      (iii)  A bank may include in the financial report a description of the fund's value on previous dates, as well as its income and disbursements during previous accounting periods. A bank may not publish in the financial report any predictions or representations as to future performance. In addition, with respect to funds described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a bank may not publish the performance of individual funds other than those administered by the bank or its affiliates.

      (iv)  A bank administering a collective investment fund shall provide a copy of the financial report, or shall provide notice that a copy of the report is available upon request without charge, to each person who ordinarily would receive a regular periodic accounting with respect to each participating account. The bank may provide a copy of the financial report to prospective customers. In addition, the bank shall provide a copy of the report upon request to any person for a reasonable charge.

      (7)  A bank may not advertise or publicize any fund authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except in connection with the advertisement of the general fiduciary services of the bank.

      (8)  A national bank administering a collective investment fund must comply with the following (in addition to § 9.12):

      (i)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may not have an interest in that fund other than in its fiduciary capacity. If, because of a creditor relationship or otherwise, the bank acquires an interest in a participating account, the participating account must be withdrawn on the next withdrawal date. However, a bank may invest assets that it holds as fiduciary for its own employees in a collective investment fund.

      (ii)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may not make any loan on the security of a participant's interest in the fund. An unsecured advance to a fiduciary account participating in the fund until the time of the next valuation date does not constitute the acquisition of an interest in a participating account by the bank.

      (iii)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may purchase for its own account any defaulted investment held by the fund (in lieu of segregating the investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section) if, in the judgment of the bank, the cost of segregating the investment is excessive in light of the market value of the investment. If a bank elects to purchase a defaulted investment, it shall do so at the greater of market value or the sum of cost and accrued unpaid interest.

      (9)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may charge a reasonable fund management fee only if:

      (i) The fee is permitted under applicable law (and complies with fee disclosure requirements, if any) in the state in which the bank maintains the fund; and

      (ii) The amount of the fee does not exceed an amount commensurate with the value of legitimate services of tangible benefit to the participating fiduciary accounts that would not have been provided to the accounts were they not invested in the fund.

      (10)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may charge reasonable expenses incurred in operating the collective investment fund, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund. However, a bank shall absorb the expenses of establishing or reorganizing a collective investment fund.

      (11)  A bank administering a collective investment fund may not issue any certificate or other document representing a direct or indirect interest in the fund, except to provide a withdrawing account with an interest in a segregated investment.

      (12)  The OCC will not deem a bank's mistake made in good faith and in the exercise of due care in connection with the administration of a collective investment fund to be a violation of this part if, promptly after the discovery of the mistake, the bank takes whatever action is practicable under the circumstances to remedy the mistake.

      (c)  In addition to the collective investment funds authorized under paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may collectively invest assets that it holds as fiduciary, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, as follows:

      (1)  In the following loans or obligations, if the bank's only interest in the loans or obligations is its capacity as fiduciary:

      (i) A single real estate loan, a direct obligation of the United States, or an obligation fully guaranteed by the United States, or a single fixed amount security, obligation, or other property, either real, personal, or mixed, of a single issuer; or

      (ii) A variable amount note of a borrower of prime credit, if the bank uses the note solely for investment of funds held in its fiduciary accounts.

      (2)  In a fund maintained by the bank for the collective investment of cash balances received or held by a bank in its capacity as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act, that the bank considers too small to be invested separately to advantage. The total assets in the fund must not exceed $1,500,000 and the number of participating accounts must not exceed 100. The OCC shall adjust this $1,500,000 threshold amount on January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1, rounded to the nearest $100 increment, and make this adjusted amount available to the public.

      (3)  In any investment specifically authorized by the instrument creating the fiduciary account or a court order, in the case of trusts created by a corporation, including its affiliates and subsidiaries, or by several individual settlors who are closely related.

      (4)  In any collective investment authorized by applicable law, such as investments pursuant to a state pre-need funeral statute.

      (5)  In any other manner described by the bank in a written plan approved by the OCC.   In order to obtain a special exemption, a bank shall submit to the OCC a written plan that sets forth:

      (i) The reason that the proposed fund requires a special exemption;

      (ii) The provisions of the proposed fund that are inconsistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;

      (iii) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section for which the bank seeks an exemption; and

      (iv) The manner in which the proposed fund addresses the rights and interests of participating accounts.

    Interpretations

      § 9.100   Acting as indenture trustee and creditor.

#### § § 9.100

      With respect to a debt securities issuance, a national bank may act both as indenture trustee and as creditor until 90 days after default, if the bank maintains adequate controls to manage the potential conflicts of interest.

      § 9.101   Providing investment advice for a fee.

#### § § 9.101

      (a)  The term “fiduciary capacity” at § 9.2(e) is defined to include “investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice.” In other words, if a bank is providing investment advice for a fee, then it is acting in a fiduciary capacity. For purposes of that definition, “investment adviser” generally means a national bank that provides advice or recommendations concerning the purchase or sale of specific securities, such as a national bank engaged in portfolio advisory and management activities (including acting as investment adviser to a mutual fund). Additionally, the qualifying phrase “if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice” excludes those activities in which the investment advice is merely incidental to other services.

      (b) —(1)  Engaging in full-service brokerage may entail providing investment advice for a fee, depending upon the commission structure and specific facts. Full-service brokerage involves investment advice for a fee if a non-bank broker engaged in that activity is considered an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 ).

      (2)  The following activities generally do not entail providing investment advice for a fee:

      (i) Financial advisory and counseling activities, including strategic planning of a financial nature, merger and acquisition advisory services, advisory and structuring services related to project finance transactions, and providing market economic information to customers in general;

      (ii) Client-directed investment activities ( the bank has no investment discretion) where investment advice and research may be made available to the client, but the fee does not depend on the provision of investment advice;

      (iii) Investment advisory activities incidental to acting as a municipal securities dealer;

      (iv) Real estate management services provided to other financial institutions;

      (v) Real estate consulting services, including acting as a finder in locating, analyzing, and making recommendations regarding the purchase of property, and making recommendations concerning the sale of property;

      (vi) Advisory activities concerning bridge loans;

      (vii) Advisory activities for homeowners' associations;

      (viii) Advisory activities concerning tax planning and structuring; and

      (ix) Investment advisory activities authorized by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) as incidental to the business of banking.

    (iii) In connection with their duties, obtain information concerning which securities are purchased, sold, or recommended for purchase or sale by the bank.

#### § § 12.9

    (a) All contracts effected or entered into by a national bank for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted security as defined in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12), government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills) shall provide for completion of the transaction within the number of business days in the standard settlement cycle followed by registered broker dealers in the United States, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.

    Interpretations

      § 13.100   Obligations concerning institutional customers.

#### § § 13.100

      (a) As a result of broadened authority provided by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3 and 78o-5), the OCC is adopting sales practice rules for the government securities market, a market with a particularly broad institutional component. Accordingly, the OCC believes it is appropriate to provide further guidance to banks on their suitability obligations when making recommendations to institutional customers.

      (b) The OCC's suitability rule (§ 13.4) is fundamental to fair dealing and is intended to promote ethical sales practices and high standards of professional conduct. Banks' responsibilities include having a reasonable basis for recommending a particular security or strategy, as well as having reasonable grounds for believing the recommendation is suitable for the customer to whom it is made. Banks are expected to meet the same high standards of competence, professionalism, and good faith regardless of the financial circumstances of the customer.

      (c) In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any government security, the bank shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by the customer as to the customer's other security holdings and financial situation and needs.

      (d) The interpretation in this section concerns only the manner in which a bank determines that a recommendation is suitable for a particular institutional customer. The manner in which a bank fulfills this suitability obligation will vary, depending on the nature of the customer and the specific transaction. Accordingly, the interpretation in this section deals only with guidance regarding how a bank may fulfill customer-specific suitability obligations under § 13.4.

      (e) While it is difficult to define in advance the scope of a bank's suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction recommended by a bank, the OCC has identified certain factors that may be relevant when considering compliance with § 13.4. These factors are not intended to be requirements or the only factors to be considered but are offered merely as guidance in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations.

      (f) The two most important considerations in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations in making recommendations to an institutional customer are the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk independently and the extent to which the customer is exercising independent judgement in evaluating a bank's recommendation. A bank must determine, based on the information available to it, the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk. In some cases, the bank may conclude that the customer is not capable of making independent investment decisions in general. In other cases, the institutional customer may have general capability, but may not be able to understand a particular type of instrument or its risk. This is more likely to arise with relatively new types of instruments, or those with significantly different risk or volatility characteristics than other investments generally made by the institution. If a customer is either generally not capable of evaluating investment risk or lacks sufficient capability to evaluate the particular product, the scope of a bank's customer-specific obligations under § 13.4 would not be diminished by the fact that the bank was dealing with an institutional customer. On the other hand, the fact that a customer initially needed help understanding a potential investment need not necessarily imply that the customer did not ultimately develop an understanding and make an independent investment decision.

      (g) A bank may conclude that a customer is exercising independent judgement if the customer's investment decision will be based on its own independent assessment of the opportunities and risks presented by a potential investment, market factors and other investment considerations. Where the bank has reasonable grounds for concluding that the institutional customer is making independent investment decisions and is capable of independently evaluating investment risk, then a bank's obligations under § 13.4 for a particular customer are fulfilled.   Where a customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment advisor or a bank trust department, the interpretation in this section shall be applied to the agent.

      (h) A determination of capability to evaluate investment risk independently will depend on an examination of the customer's capability to make its own investment decisions, including the resources available to the customer to make informed decisions. Relevant considerations could include:

      (1) The use of one or more consultants, investment advisers, or bank trust departments;

      (2) The general level of experience of the institutional customer in financial markets and specific experience with the type of instruments under consideration;

      (3) The customer's ability to understand the economic features of the security involved;

      (4) The customer's ability to independently evaluate how market developments would affect the security; and

      (5) The complexity of the security or securities involved.

      (i) A determination that a customer is making independent investment decisions will depend on the nature of the relationship that exists between the bank and the customer.

      Relevant considerations could include:

      (1) Any written or oral understanding that exists between the bank and the customer regarding the nature of the relationship between the bank and the customer and the services to be rendered by the bank;

      (2) The presence or absence of a pattern of acceptance of the bank's recommendations;

      (3) The use by the customer of ideas, suggestions, market views and information obtained from other government securities brokers or dealers or market professionals, particularly those relating to the same type of securities; and

      (4) The extent to which the bank has received from the customer current comprehensive portfolio information in connection with discussing recommended transactions or has not been provided important information regarding its portfolio or investment objectives.

      (j) Banks are reminded that these factors are merely guidelines that will be utilized to determine whether a bank has fulfilled its suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction and that the inclusion or absence of any of these factors is not dispositive of the determination of suitability. Such a determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a particular bank/customer relationship, assessed in the context of a particular transaction.

      (k) For purposes of the interpretation in this section, an institutional customer shall be any entity other than a natural person. In determining the applicability of the interpretation in this section to an institutional customer, the OCC will consider the dollar value of the securities that the institutional customer has in its portfolio and/or under management. While the interpretation in this section is potentially applicable to any institutional customer, the guidance contained in this section is more appropriately applied to an institutional customer with at least $10 million invested in securities in the aggregate in its portfolio and/or under management.

    (2)  If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by mail, a covered person is not required to make the oral disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section. If a covered person takes an application for credit by mail, the covered person is not required to make the oral disclosure required by paragraph (b).

    (3)  If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by telephone, a covered person may provide the written disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section by mail within 3 business days beginning on the first business day after the sale, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). If a covered person takes an application for credit by telephone, the covered person may provide the written disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section by mail, provided the covered person mails it to the consumer within three days beginning the first business day after the application is taken, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).

    (iii) With respect to those disclosures made through electronic media for which paper or oral disclosures are not required, the disclosures are not meaningfully provided if the consumer may bypass the visual text of the disclosures before purchasing an insurance product or annuity.

    (7)  A covered person must obtain from the consumer, at the time a consumer receives the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, or at the time of the initial purchase by the consumer of an insurance product or annuity, a written acknowledgment by the consumer that the consumer received the disclosures. A covered person may permit a consumer to acknowledge receipt of the disclosures electronically or in paper form. If the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are provided in connection with a transaction that is conducted by telephone, a covered person must:

    (i) Obtain an oral acknowledgment of receipt of the disclosures and maintain sufficient documentation to show that the acknowledgment was given; and

    (ii) Make reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgment from the consumer.

    (d)  The disclosures described in paragraph (a) of this section are required in advertisements and promotional material for insurance products or annuities unless the advertisements and promotional materials are of a general nature describing or listing the services or products offered by the bank or Federal savings association.

      (3) —(i) Any individual acting on the individual's own behalf or as counsel on behalf of a party, including the OCC, must file a notice of appearance with OFIA at or before the time that the individual submits papers or otherwise appears on behalf of a party in the adjudicatory proceeding.

Electronic signatures may be used to satisfy the signature requirements of this section.

      (b) —(1) The signature of counsel or a party will constitute a certification that: the counsel or party has read the filing or submission of record; to the best of the counsel's or party's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing or submission of record is well-grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and the filing or submission of record is not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.

      § 19.8   Conflicts of interest.

#### § § 19.8

      (a)  No person may appear as counsel for another person in an adjudicatory proceeding if it reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by that counsel's responsibilities to a third person or by the counsel's own interests. The ALJ may take corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.

      (b)  If any person appearing as counsel represents two or more parties to an adjudicatory proceeding or also represents a non-party on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding, counsel must certify in writing at the time of filing the notice of appearance required by § 19.6(a):

      (1) That the counsel has personally and fully discussed the possibility of conflicts of interest with each such party and non-party; and

      (2) That each such party and non-party waives any right it might otherwise have had to assert any known conflicts of interest or to assert any non-material conflicts of interest during the course of the proceeding.

      (2) The Comptroller, ALJ, or decisional employee may not make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the OCC any  communication.

      (c)  If an  communication is received by the ALJ, the Comptroller, or any other person identified in paragraph (a) of this section, that person will cause all such written communications (or, if the communication is oral, a memorandum stating the substance of the communication) to be placed on the record of the proceeding and served on all parties. All other parties to the proceeding may, within ten days of service of the  communication, file responses thereto and to recommend any sanctions that they believe to be appropriate under the circumstances.

      § 19.12   Construction of time limits.

#### § § 19.12

      (a)  In computing any period of time prescribed by this subpart, the date of the act or event that commences the designated period of time is not included. The last day so computed is included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. When the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in the computation of time.

      (2) If service is made by overnight delivery service, add two calendar days to the prescribed period; or

#### § § 19.13

After the referral of the case to the Comptroller pursuant to § 19.38, the Comptroller may grant extensions of the time limits for good cause shown.

#### § § 19.14

#### § § 19.15

      Any respondent may, at any time in the proceeding, unilaterally submit to Enforcement Counsel written offers or proposals for settlement of a proceeding, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties. Any such offer or proposal may only be made to Enforcement Counsel. Submission of a written settlement offer does not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any portion of a proceeding under this part. No settlement offer or proposal, or any subsequent negotiation or resolution, is admissible as evidence in any proceeding.

      § 19.16   OCC's right to conduct examination.

#### § § 19.16

      Nothing contained in this subpart limits in any manner the right of the OCC to conduct any examination, inspection, or visitation of any institution or institution-affiliated party, or the right of the OCC to conduct or continue any form of investigation authorized by law.

No default or other failure to act as directed in the adjudicatory proceeding within the times prescribed in this subpart will be excused based on the pendency before any court of any interlocutory appeal or collateral attack.

      § 19.18   Commencement of proceeding and contents of notice.

#### § § 19.18

      (a) —(1)(i) Except for change-in-control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4), a proceeding governed by this subpart is commenced by issuance of a notice by the Comptroller.

      (ii) The notice must be served by Enforcement Counsel upon the respondent and given to any other appropriate financial institution supervisory authority where required by law. Enforcement Counsel may serve the notice upon counsel for the respondent, provided that Enforcement Counsel has confirmed that counsel represents the respondent in the matter and will accept service of the notice on behalf of the respondent.

      (iii) Enforcement Counsel must file the notice with OFIA.

      (2) Change-in control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)) commence with the issuance of an order by the Comptroller.

      (b)  Notice pleading applies. The notice must provide:

      (1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the OCC's jurisdiction over the proceeding;

      (2) Matters of fact or law showing that the OCC is entitled to relief;

      (3) A proposed order or prayer for an order granting the requested relief;

      (4) The time, place, and nature of the hearing as required by law or regulation;

      (5) The time within which to file an answer as required by law or regulation;

      (6) The time within which to request a hearing as required by law or regulation; and

      (7) That the answer and/or request for a hearing must be filed with OFIA.

      § 19.19   Answer.

#### § § 19.19

      (a)  Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent must file an answer as designated in the notice. In a civil money penalty proceeding, respondent must also file a request for a hearing within 20 days of service of the notice.

      (b)  An answer must specifically respond to each paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice and must admit, deny, or state that the respondent lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the notice which is not denied in the answer is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, asserted by the respondent.

      (c) —(1)  Failure of a respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice. Any final order issued by the Comptroller based upon a respondent's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent.

      (2)  If respondent fails to request a hearing as required by law within the time provided, the notice of assessment constitutes a final and unappealable order of the Comptroller without further action by the ALJ.

      § 19.20   Amended pleadings.

#### § § 19.20

      (a)  The notice or answer may be amended or supplemented at any stage of the proceeding. The respondent must answer an amended notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the original notice, or within ten days after service of the amended notice, whichever period is longer, unless the Comptroller or ALJ orders otherwise for good cause.

      (b)  When issues not raised in the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties, they will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the ALJ may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action and the objecting party fails to satisfy the ALJ that the admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The ALJ may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.

      § 19.21   Failure to appear.

#### § § 19.21

      Failure of a respondent to appear in person at the hearing or by a duly authorized counsel constitutes a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing and is deemed an admission of the facts as alleged and consent to the relief sought in the notice. Without further proceedings or notice to the respondent, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice.

      § 19.22   Consolidation and severance of actions.

#### § § 19.22

      (a) —(1) On the motion of any party, or on the ALJ's own motion, the ALJ may consolidate, for some or all purposes, any two or more proceedings, if each such proceeding involves or arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences, or involves at least one common respondent or a material common question of law or fact, unless such consolidation would cause unreasonable delay or injustice.

      (2) In the event of consolidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustment to the prehearing schedule must be made to avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.

      (b)  The ALJ may, upon the motion of any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as to any respondent only if the ALJ finds:

      (1) Undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result from not severing the proceeding; and

      (2) Such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests of judicial economy and expedition in the complete and final resolution of the proceeding.

      § 19.23   Motions.

#### § § 19.23

      (a) —(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application or request for an order or ruling must be made by written motion.

      (2) All written motions must state with particularity the relief sought and must be accompanied by a proposed order.

      (3) No oral argument may be held on written motions except as otherwise directed by the ALJ. Written memoranda, briefs, affidavits, or other relevant material or documents may be filed in support of or in opposition to a motion.

      (b)  A motion may be made orally on the record unless the ALJ directs that such motion be reduced to writing.

      (c)  Motions must be filed with the ALJ, except that following the filing of the recommended decision, motions must be filed with the Comptroller.

      (d) —(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, within ten days after service of any written motion, or within such other period of time as may be established by the ALJ or the Comptroller, any party may file a written response to a motion. The ALJ will not rule on any oral or written motion before each party has had an opportunity to file a response.

      (2) The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral motion made on the record is deemed a consent by that party to the entry of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying the motion.

      (e)  Frivolous, dilatory or repetitive motions are prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.

      (f)  Dispositive motions are governed by §§ 19.29 and 19.30.

      § 19.24   Scope of document discovery.

#### § § 19.24

      (a) —(1) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, a party to a proceeding under this subpart may obtain document discovery by serving a written request to produce _documents_. For purposes of a request to produce documents, the term  includes writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, electronically stored information, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation by the responding party, into a reasonably usable form.

      (2) Discovery by use of deposition is governed by subpart I of this part.

      (3) Discovery by use of either interrogatories or requests for admission is not permitted.

      (4) Any request to produce documents that calls for irrelevant material; or that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or that seeks to obtain privileged documents will be denied or modified. A request is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome if, among other things, it fails to include justifiable limitations on the time period covered and the geographic locations to be searched, or the time provided to respond in the request is inadequate.

      (b)  A party may obtain document discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that has material relevance to the merits of the pending action.

      (c)  Privileged documents are not discoverable. Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product doctrine, bank examination privilege, law enforcement privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, and any other privileges the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law provide.

      (d)  All document discovery, including all responses to discovery requests, must be completed by the date set by the ALJ and no later than 30 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, except as provided in the Local Rules. No exceptions to this time limit are permitted, unless the ALJ finds on the record that good cause exists for waiving the requirements of paragraph (d).

      § 19.25   Request for document discovery from parties.

#### § § 19.25

      (a) —(1) Any party may serve on any other party a request to produce and permit the requesting party or its representative to inspect or copy any discoverable documents that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served. In the case of a request for inspection, the responding party may produce copies of documents or of electronically stored information instead of permitting inspection.

      (2) The request:

      (i) Must describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be inspected or produced; and

      (ii) Must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection or production.

      (b) —(1)  Unless otherwise specified by the ALJ or agreed upon by the parties, the producing party must produce copies of documents as they are kept in the usual course of business or organized to correspond to the categories of the request, and electronically stored information must be produced in a form in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form.

      (2)  The producing party must pay its own costs to respond to a discovery request, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

      (c)  A party who has responded to a discovery request with a response that was complete when made is not required to supplement the response to include documents thereafter acquired, unless the responding party learns:

      (1) The response was materially incorrect when made; or

      (2) The response, though correct when made, is no longer true and a failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing concealment.

      (d) —(1) Any party that objects to a discovery request may, within 20 days of being served with such request, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 19.23 to strike or otherwise limit the request. If an objection is made to only a portion of an item or category in a request, the portion objected to must be specified. Any objections not made in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) and § 19.23 are waived.

      (2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion to strike or limit may file a written response within ten days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.

      (e)  At the time other documents are produced, the producing party must reasonably identify all documents withheld on the grounds of privilege and must produce a statement of the basis for the assertion of privilege. When similar documents that are protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product doctrine, bank examination privilege, law enforcement privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, or any other privileges of the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law, or are voluminous, these documents may be identified by category instead of by individual document. The ALJ retains discretion to determine when the identification by category is insufficient.

      (f) —(1) If a party withholds any documents as privileged or fails to comply fully with a discovery request, the requesting party may, within ten days of the assertion of privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 19.23 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling production.

      (2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with the document request may file a written response to a motion to compel within ten days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.

      (g)  After the time for filing responses pursuant to this section has expired, the ALJ will rule promptly on all motions filed pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that a discovery request, or any of its terms, calls for irrelevant material, is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or seeks to obtain privileged documents, the ALJ may deny or modify the request, and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon such conditions as justice may require. The pendency of a motion to strike or limit discovery or to compel production is not a basis for staying or continuing the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ. Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the ALJ may not release, or order a party to produce, documents withheld on grounds of privilege if the party has stated to the ALJ its intention to file a timely motion for interlocutory review of the ALJ's order to produce the documents, and until the motion for interlocutory review has been decided.

      (h)  If the ALJ issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party, the subpoenaing party may, in the event of noncompliance and to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to any appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a subpoena will not in any manner limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ against a party who fails to produce subpoenaed documents.

      § 19.26   Document subpoenas to nonparties.

#### § § 19.26

      (a) —(1) Any party may apply to the ALJ for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain a proposed document subpoena and a brief statement showing the general relevance and reasonableness of the scope of documents sought. The subpoenaing party must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for making production in response to the document subpoena.

      (2) A party may apply for a document subpoena under this section only within the time period during which such party could serve a discovery request under § 19.24(d). The party obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all parties. Document subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law.

      (3) The ALJ will promptly issue any document subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, the ALJ may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon such conditions as may be consistent with the Uniform Rules.

      (b) —(1) Any person to whom a document subpoena is directed may file a motion to quash or modify such subpoena with the ALJ. The motion must be accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on all parties, and any party may respond to such motion within ten days of service of the motion.

      (2) Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed on the same basis, including the assertion of privilege, upon which a party could object to a discovery request under § 19.25(d), and during the same time limits during which such an objection could be filed.

      (c)  If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the ALJ, which directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with so much of the document subpoena as the ALJ has not quashed or modified. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a document subpoena will in no way limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ on a party who induces a failure to comply with subpoenas issued under this section.

      § 19.27   Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.

#### § § 19.27

      (a) —(1) If a witness will not be available for the hearing, a party desiring to preserve that witness' testimony for the record may apply in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the ALJ for the issuance of a subpoena, including a subpoena  requiring the attendance of the witness at a deposition. The ALJ may issue a deposition subpoena under this section upon showing:

      (i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from attending the hearing because of age, sickness or infirmity, or will otherwise be unavailable;

      (ii) The witness' unavailability was not procured or caused by the subpoenaing party;

      (iii) The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and

      (iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.

      (2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and specify the time, manner, and place for taking the deposition. A deposition subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment, by remote means, or such other convenient place or manner, as the ALJ fixes.

      (3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its issuance must be promptly issued, unless the ALJ requires a written response or requires attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena should be issued.

      (4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, no deposition under this section may be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and all parties.

      (b) —(1) The witness and any party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena issued under this section may file a motion with the ALJ to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of the subpoena.

      (2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion must be served on all parties.

      (c) —(1) Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the ALJ, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the deponent. Each party must have the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be recorded.

      (2) Any party may move before the ALJ for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to submit during the deposition.

      (3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking the deposition must certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the deposition.

      (d)  If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section, or fails to comply with any order of the ALJ, which directs compliance with all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under paragraphs (b) or (c)(2) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the portions of the subpoena with which the subpoenaed party has not complied. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a deposition subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ on a party who fails to comply with, or procures a failure to comply with, a subpoena issued under this section.

      § 19.28   Interlocutory review.

#### § § 19.28

      (a)  The Comptroller may review a ruling of the ALJ prior to the certification of the record to the Comptroller only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and § 19.23.

      (b)  The Comptroller may exercise interlocutory review of a ruling of the ALJ if the Comptroller finds:

      (1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;

      (2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;

      (3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or

      (4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay or expense.

      (c)  Any request for interlocutory review must be filed by a party with the ALJ within ten days of the ruling and must otherwise comply with § 19.23. Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in accordance with § 19.23(d). Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the ALJ will refer the matter to the Comptroller for final disposition.

      (d)  Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Comptroller under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ or the Comptroller.

      § 19.29   Summary disposition.

#### § § 19.29

      (a)  The ALJ will recommend that the Comptroller issue a final order granting a motion for summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in connection with a motion for summary disposition show:

      (1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and

      (2) The moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.

      (b) —(1) Any party who believes there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding. Any party, within 20 days after service of such a motion, or within such time period as allowed by the ALJ, may file a response to such motion.

      (2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party contends supports the moving party's position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which the opposing party contends a genuine dispute exists. Such opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.

      (c)  At the written request of any party or on the ALJ's own motion, the ALJ may hear oral argument on the motion for summary disposition.

      (d)  Following receipt of a motion for summary disposition and all responses thereto, the ALJ will determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary disposition. If the ALJ determines that summary disposition is warranted, the ALJ will submit a recommended decision to that effect to the Comptroller. If the ALJ finds that no party is entitled to summary disposition, the ALJ will make a ruling denying the motion.

      § 19.30   Partial summary disposition.

#### § § 19.30

      If the ALJ determines that a party is entitled to summary disposition as to certain claims only, the ALJ will defer submitting a recommended decision as to those claims. A hearing on the remaining issues must be ordered. Those claims for which the ALJ has determined that summary disposition is warranted will be addressed in the recommended decision filed at the conclusion of the hearing.

      § 19.31   Scheduling and prehearing conferences.

#### § § 19.31

      (a)  Within 30 days of service of the notice or order commencing a proceeding, the ALJ will direct counsel for all parties to meet with the ALJ at a specified time and manner prior to the hearing for the purpose of scheduling the course and conduct of the proceeding. This meeting is called a “scheduling conference.” The schedule for the identification of potential witnesses, the time for and manner of discovery, and the exchange of any prehearing materials including witness lists, statements of issues, stipulations, exhibits, and any other materials may also be determined at the scheduling conference.

      (b)  The ALJ may, in addition to the scheduling conference, on the ALJ's own motion or at the request of any party, direct counsel for the parties to confer with the ALJ at a prehearing conference to address any or all of the following:

      (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;

      (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and the contents, authenticity and admissibility into evidence of documents;

      (3) Matters of which official notice may be taken;

      (4) Limitation of the number of witnesses;

      (5) Summary disposition of any or all issues;

      (6) Resolution of discovery issues or disputes;

      (7) Amendments to pleadings; and

      (8) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the proceeding.

      (c)  The ALJ may require that a scheduling or prehearing conference be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the conference and any materials filed, including orders, becomes part of the record of the proceeding. A party may obtain a copy of the transcript at the party's expense.

      (d)  At or within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the scheduling conference or any prehearing conference, the ALJ will serve on each party an order setting forth any agreements reached and any procedural determinations made.

      § 19.32   Prehearing submissions.

#### § § 19.32

      (a)  Within the time set by the ALJ, but in no case later than 20 days before the start of the hearing, each party must file with the ALJ and serve on every other party:

      (1) A prehearing statement that states:

      (i) The party's position with respect to the legal issues presented;

      (ii) The statutory and case law upon which the party relies; and

      (iii) The facts that the party expects to prove at the hearing;

      (2) A final list of witnesses to be called to testify at the hearing, including the name, mailing address, and electronic mail address of each witness and a short summary of the expected testimony of each witness, which need not identify the exhibits to be relied upon by each witness at the hearing;

      (3) A list of the exhibits expected to be introduced at the hearing along with a copy of each exhibit; and

      (4) Stipulations of fact, if any.

      (b)  No witness may testify and no exhibits may be introduced at the hearing if such witness or exhibit is not listed in the prehearing submissions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, except for good cause shown.

      § 19.33   Public hearings.

#### § § 19.33

      (a)  All hearings must be open to the public, unless the Comptroller in their discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest. Within 20 days of service of the notice or, in the case of change-in-control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)), within 20 days from service of the hearing order, any respondent may file with the Comptroller a request for a private hearing, and any party may file a reply to such a request. A party must serve on the ALJ a copy of any request or reply the party files with the Comptroller. The form of, and procedure for, these requests and replies are governed by § 19.23. A party's failure to file a request or a reply constitutes a waiver of any objections regarding whether the hearing will be public or private.

      (b)  Enforcement Counsel, in Enforcement Counsel's discretion, may file any document or part of a document under seal if disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. The ALJ will take all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such documents or parts thereof, including closing portions of the hearing to the public.

      § 19.34   Hearing subpoenas.

#### § § 19.34

      (a) —(1) Upon application of a party showing general relevance and reasonableness of scope of the testimony or other evidence sought, the ALJ may issue a subpoena or a subpoena  requiring the attendance of a witness at the hearing or the production of documentary or physical evidence at the hearing. The application for a hearing subpoena must also contain a proposed subpoena specifying the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence from any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law at any designated place where the hearing is being conducted. The party making the application must serve a copy of the application and the proposed subpoena on every other party.

      (2) A party may apply for a hearing subpoena at any time before the commencement of a hearing. During a hearing, a party may make an application for a subpoena orally on the record before the ALJ.

      (3) The ALJ will promptly issue any hearing subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, the ALJ may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon any conditions consistent with this subpart. Upon issuance by the ALJ, the party making the application must serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena and on each party.

      (b) —(1) Any person to whom a hearing subpoena is directed or any party may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on each party and on the person named in the subpoena. Any party may respond to the motion within ten days of service of the motion.

      (2) Any motion to quash or modify a hearing subpoena must be filed prior to the time specified in the subpoena for compliance but not more than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena upon the movant.

      (c)  If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the ALJ which directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party may seek enforcement of the subpoena pursuant to § 19.26(c).

      § 19.35   Conduct of hearings.

#### § § 19.35

      (a) —(1)  Hearings must be conducted so as to provide a fair and expeditious presentation of the relevant disputed issues. Each party has the right to present its case or defense by oral and documentary evidence and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for full disclosure of the facts.

      (2)  Enforcement Counsel will present its case-in-chief first, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ, or unless otherwise expressly specified by law or regulation. Enforcement Counsel will be the first party to present an opening statement and a closing statement and may make a rebuttal statement after the respondent's closing statement. If there are multiple respondents, respondents may agree among themselves as to their order of presentation of their cases, but if they do not agree, the ALJ will fix the order.

      (3)  Only one counsel for each party may conduct an examination of a witness, except that in the case of extensive direct examination, the ALJ may permit more than one counsel for the party presenting the witness to conduct the examination. A party may have one counsel conduct the direct examination and another counsel conduct re-direct examination of a witness, or may have one counsel conduct the cross examination of a witness and another counsel conduct the re-cross examination of a witness.

      (4)  Unless the ALJ directs otherwise, all stipulations of fact and law previously agreed upon by the parties, and all documents, the admissibility of which have been previously stipulated, will be admitted into evidence upon commencement of the hearing.

      (b)  The hearing must be recorded and transcribed. The reporter will make the transcript available to any party upon payment by that party to the reporter of the cost of the transcript. The ALJ may order the record corrected, either upon motion to correct, upon stipulation of the parties, or following notice to the parties upon the ALJ's own motion.

      (c)  Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the ALJ may direct the use of, or any party may use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the ALJ requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for their own presentation and related costs, unless the parties agree to another manner in which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.

      § 19.36   Evidence.

#### § § 19.36

      (a) —(1) Except as is otherwise set forth in this section, relevant, material, and reliable evidence that is not unduly repetitive is admissible to the fullest extent authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law.

      (2) Evidence that would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence is admissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this subpart.

      (3) Evidence that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence may not be deemed or ruled to be inadmissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this subpart if such evidence is relevant, material, reliable and not unduly repetitive.

      (b) —(1) _Official notice_ may be taken of any material fact which may be judicially noticed by a United States district court and any material information in the official public records of any Federal or State government agency.

      (2) All matters officially noticed by the ALJ or the Comptroller must appear on the record.

      (3) If official notice is requested or taken of any material fact, the parties, upon timely request, must be afforded an opportunity to object.

      (c) —(1) A duplicate copy of a document is admissible to the same extent as the original, unless a genuine issue is raised as to whether the copy is in some material respect not a true and legible copy of the original.

      (2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, any document, including a report of examination, supervisory activity, inspection, or visitation, prepared by an appropriate Federal financial institutions regulatory agency or by a State regulatory agency, is admissible either with or without a sponsoring witness.

      (3) Witnesses may use existing or newly created charts, exhibits, calendars, calculations, outlines, or other graphic material to summarize, illustrate, or simplify the presentation of testimony. Such materials may, subject to the ALJ's discretion, be used with or without being admitted into evidence.

      (d) —(1) _Objections_ to the admissibility of evidence must be timely made and rulings on all objections must appear on the record.

      (2) When an objection to a question or line of questioning propounded to a witness is sustained, the examining counsel may make a specific proffer on the record of what the examining counsel expected to prove by the expected testimony of the witness either by representation of counsel or by direct questioning of the witness.

      (3) The ALJ will retain rejected exhibits, adequately marked for identification, for the record, and transmit such exhibits to the Comptroller.

      (4) Failure to object to admission of evidence or to any ruling constitutes a waiver of the objection.

      (e)  The parties may stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact or the authentication of any relevant documents. Such stipulations must be received in evidence at a hearing and are binding on the parties with respect to the matters therein stipulated.

      (f) —(1) If a witness is unavailable to testify at a hearing, and that witness has testified in a deposition to which all parties in a proceeding had notice and an opportunity to participate, a party may offer as evidence all or any part of the transcript of the deposition, including deposition exhibits, if any.

      (2) Such deposition transcript is admissible to the same extent that testimony would have been admissible had that person testified at the hearing, provided that if a witness refused to answer proper questions during the depositions, the ALJ may, on that basis, limit the admissibility of the deposition in any manner that justice requires.

      (3) Only those portions of a deposition received in evidence at the hearing constitute a part of the record.

      § 19.37   Post-hearing filings.

#### § § 19.37

      (a) —(1) Using the same method of service for each party, the ALJ will serve notice upon each party that the certified transcript, together with all hearing exhibits and exhibits introduced but not admitted into evidence at the hearing, has been filed. Any party may file with the ALJ proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law, and a proposed order within 30 days following service of this notice by the ALJ or within such longer period as may be ordered by the ALJ.

      (2) Proposed findings and conclusions must be supported by citation to any relevant authorities and by page references to any relevant portions of the record. A post-hearing brief may be filed in support of proposed findings and conclusions, either as part of the same document or in a separate document. Any party who fails to file timely with the ALJ any proposed finding or conclusion is deemed to have waived the right to raise in any subsequent filing or submission any issue not addressed in such party's proposed finding or conclusion.

      (b)  Reply briefs may be filed within 15 days after the date on which the parties' proposed findings, conclusions, and order are due. Reply briefs must be strictly limited to responding to new matters, issues, or arguments raised in another party's papers. A party who has not filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law or a post-hearing brief may not file a reply brief.

      (c)  The ALJ will not order the filing by any party of any brief or reply brief in advance of the other party's filing of its brief.

      § 19.38   Recommended decision and filing of record.

#### § § 19.38

      (a)  Within 45 days after expiration of the time allowed for filing reply briefs under § 19.37(b), the ALJ will file with and certify to the Comptroller, for decision, the record of the proceeding. The record must include the ALJ's recommended decision, recommended findings of fact, recommended conclusions of law, and proposed order; all prehearing and hearing transcripts, exhibits, and rulings; and the motions, briefs, memoranda, and other supporting papers filed in connection with the hearing. The ALJ will serve upon each party the recommended decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order.

      (b)  At the same time the ALJ files with and certifies to the Comptroller for final determination the record of the proceeding, the ALJ will furnish to the Comptroller a certified index of the entire record of the proceeding. The certified index must include, at a minimum, an entry for each paper, document, or motion filed with the ALJ in the proceeding, the date of the filing, and the identity of the filer. The certified index must also include an exhibit index containing, at a minimum, an entry consisting of exhibit number and title or description for: each exhibit introduced and admitted into evidence at the hearing; each exhibit introduced but not admitted into evidence at the hearing; each exhibit introduced and admitted into evidence after the completion of the hearing; and each exhibit introduced but not admitted into evidence after the completion of the hearing.

      § 19.39   Exceptions to recommended decision.

#### § § 19.39

      (a)  Within 30 days after service of the recommended decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order under § 19.38, a party may file with the Comptroller written exceptions to the ALJ's recommended decision, findings, conclusions, or proposed order, to the admission or exclusion of evidence, or to the failure of the ALJ to make a ruling proposed by a party. A supporting brief may be filed at the time the exceptions are filed, either as part of the same document or in a separate document.

      (b) —(1) Failure of a party to file exceptions to those matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section within the time prescribed is deemed a waiver of objection thereto.

      (2) No exception need be considered by the Comptroller if the party taking exception had an opportunity to raise the same objection, issue, or argument before the ALJ and failed to do so.

      (c) —(1) All exceptions and briefs in support of such exceptions must be confined to the particular matters in, or omissions from, the ALJ's recommendations to which that party takes exception.

      (2) All exceptions and briefs in support of exceptions must set forth page or paragraph references to the specific parts of the ALJ's recommendations to which exception is taken, the page or paragraph references to those portions of the record relied upon to support each exception, and the legal authority relied upon to support each exception.

      § 19.40   Review by the Comptroller.

#### § § 19.40

      (a)  When the Comptroller determines that the record in the proceeding is complete, the Comptroller will serve notice upon the parties that the proceeding has been submitted to the Comptroller for final decision.

      (b)  Upon the initiative of the Comptroller or on the written request of any party filed with the Comptroller within the time for filing exceptions, the Comptroller may order and hear oral argument on the recommended findings, conclusions, decision, and order of the ALJ. A written request by a party must show good cause for oral argument and state reasons why arguments cannot be presented adequately in writing. A denial of a request for oral argument may be set forth in the Comptroller's final decision. Oral argument before the Comptroller must be on the record.

      (c) —(1) Decisional employees may advise and assist the Comptroller in the consideration and disposition of the case. The final decision of the Comptroller will be based upon review of the entire record of the proceeding, except that the Comptroller may limit the issues to be reviewed to those findings and conclusions to which opposing arguments or exceptions have been filed by the parties.

      (2) The Comptroller will render a final decision within 90 days after notification of the parties that the case has been submitted for final decision, or 90 days after oral argument, whichever is later, unless the Comptroller orders that the action or any aspect thereof be remanded to the ALJ for further proceedings. Copies of the final decision and order of the Comptroller will be served upon each party to the proceeding, upon other persons required by statute, and, if directed by the Comptroller or required by statute, upon any appropriate State or Federal supervisory authority.

      § 19.41   Stays pending judicial review.

#### § § 19.41

      The commencement of proceedings for judicial review of a final decision and order of the Comptroller may not, unless specifically ordered by the Comptroller or a reviewing court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Comptroller. The Comptroller may, in its discretion, and on such terms as the Comptroller finds just, stay the effectiveness of all or any part of an order pending a final decision on a petition for review of that order.

In these instances, the respondent must pay the penalty within 60 days of service of the order unless the OCC requires a different time for payment.

    Subpart C—Removals, Suspensions, and Prohibitions of an Institution-Affiliated Party When a Crime Is Charged or a Conviction Is Obtained

      § 19.110   Scope and definitions.

#### § § 19.110

      (a)  This subpart applies to informal hearings afforded to any institution-affiliated party who has been suspended or removed from office or prohibited from further participation in the affairs of any depository institution pursuant to section 8(g) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)) by a notice or order issued by the Comptroller.

      (b)  As used in this subpart—

      (1) The term  means an individual who has filed a petition for an informal hearing under this subpart.

      (2) The term  means any national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank.

      (3) The term  means the Senior Deputy Comptroller or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC department or office responsible for supervision of the depository institution or, in the case of an individual no longer affiliated with a particular depository institution, the Deputy Comptroller for Special Supervision.

      § 19.111   Suspension, removal, or prohibition of institution-affiliated party.

#### § § 19.111

      (a)  The Comptroller may serve a notice of suspension or prohibition or order of removal or prohibition pursuant to section 8(g) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)) on an institution-affiliated party. The Comptroller will serve a copy of this notice or order on any depository institution that the subject of the notice or order is affiliated with at the time the OCC issues the notice or order. After service of the notice or order, the institution-affiliated party must immediately cease service to, or participation in the affairs of, that depository institution and, if so determined by the OCC, any other depository institution. The notice or order will indicate the basis for suspension, removal, or prohibition and will inform the institution-affiliated party of the right to request in writing, within 30 days from the date that the institution-affiliated party was served, an opportunity to show at an informal hearing that continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of any depository institution has not posed, does not pose, or is not likely to pose a threat to the interests of the depositors of, or has not threatened, does not threaten, or is not likely to threaten to impair public confidence in, any relevant depository institution. The Comptroller will serve the notice or order upon the institution-affiliated party and the related institution in the manner set forth in § 19.11(c).

      (b) —(1)  Unless instructed otherwise in writing by the Comptroller, an institution-affiliated party must send the written request for an informal hearing referenced in paragraph (a) of this section to the OCC Supervisory Office by certified mail, a same day courier service, an overnight delivery service, or by personal service with a signed receipt.

      (2)  The request filed under this section must state specifically the relief desired and the grounds on which that relief is based and must admit, deny, or state that the institution-affiliated party lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the notice or order. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation denied; general denials are not permitted. When the institution-affiliated party denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation in the notice or order which is not denied is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. The request must state with particularity how the institution-affiliated party intends to show that its continued service to or participation in the affairs of the institution would not pose a threat to the interests of the institution's depositors or impair public confidence in any institution.

      (c)  If the institution-affiliated party fails to timely file a petition for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or fails to appear at a hearing, either in person or by counsel, or fails to submit a written argument where oral argument has been waived pursuant to § 19.112(c), the notice will remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of and the order will remain in effect until terminated by the OCC.

      § 19.112   Informal hearing.

#### § § 19.112

      (a)  After receipt of a request for hearing, the OCC Supervisory Office must notify the petitioner requesting the hearing and OCC Enforcement of the date, time, and place fixed for the hearing. The OCC will hold the hearing no later than 30 days from the date when the OCC receives the request for a hearing, unless the time is extended in response to a written request of the petitioner. The OCC Supervisory Office may extend the hearing date only for a specific period of time and must take appropriate action to ensure that the hearing is not unduly delayed.

      (b)  The OCC Supervisory Office must appoint one or more OCC employees as the presiding officer to conduct the hearing. The presiding officer(s) may not have been involved in a prosecutorial or investigative role in the proceeding, a factually related proceeding, or the underlying enforcement action.

      (c) —(1)  When the petitioner requests a hearing, the petitioner may elect to have the matter determined by the presiding officer solely on the basis of written submissions by serving on the OCC Supervisory Office and all parties a signed document waiving the statutory right to appear and make oral argument. The petitioner must present the written submissions to the presiding officer and serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing or within a shorter time period as the presiding officer may permit.

      (2)  The OCC may respond to the petitioner's submissions by presenting the presiding officer with a written response and by serving the other parties in the manner prescribed by § 19.11(c) not later than the date fixed for the hearing or within such other time period as the presiding officer may require.

      (d) —(1)  Hearings under this subpart are not subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part or the adjudicative provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557).

      (2)  The presiding officer must determine all procedural issues that are governed by this subpart. The presiding officer also may permit witnesses, limit the number of witnesses, and impose time limitations as they deem reasonable. The informal hearing will not be governed by formal rules of evidence, including the Federal Rules of Evidence. The presiding officer must consider all oral presentations, when permitted, and all documents the presiding officer deems to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious. The presiding officer may ask questions of any person participating in the hearing and may make any rulings reasonably necessary to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the hearing.

      (3)  (i) The OCC and the petitioner may present relevant written materials and oral argument at the hearing. The petitioner may appear at the hearing personally or through counsel. Except as permitted in paragraph (c) of this section, each party, including the OCC, must file a copy of any affidavit, memorandum, or other written material to be presented at the hearing with the presiding officer and must serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the hearing or within such shorter time period as permitted by the presiding officer.

      (ii) If the petitioner or the OCC desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, they must file a written request with the presiding officer not later than ten days prior to the hearing, or within a shorter time period as required by the presiding officer. The written request must include the names of proposed witnesses, along with the general nature of the expected testimony, and the reasons why oral testimony is necessary. The presiding officer generally will not admit oral testimony or witnesses unless a specific and compelling need is demonstrated. Witnesses, if admitted, must be sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness.

      (iii) In deciding on any suspension or prohibition based on an indictment, information, or complaint, the presiding officer may not consider the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence of the individual with respect to the criminal charges that are outstanding. In deciding on any removal or prohibition with respect to a conviction or pre-trial diversion program, the presiding officer may not consider challenges to or efforts to impeach the validity of the conviction or the agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program. The presiding officer may consider facts in either situation, however, that show the nature of the events on which the criminal charges, conviction, or agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program was based.

      (4)  Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for their own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner by which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.

      (5)  A transcript of the proceedings may be taken if the petitioner requests a transcript and agrees to pay all expenses or if the presiding officer determines that the nature of the case warrants a transcript. The presiding officer may order the record to be kept open for a reasonable period following the hearing, not to exceed five business days, to permit the petitioner or the OCC to submit additional documents for the record. Thereafter, no further submissions may be accepted except for good cause shown.

      § 19.113   Recommended and final decisions.

#### § § 19.113

      (a)  The presiding officer must issue a recommended decision to the Comptroller within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing or, when the petitioner has waived an oral hearing, within 20 days of the date fixed for the hearing. The presiding officer must serve promptly a copy of the recommended decision on the parties to the proceeding. The decision must include a summary of the facts and arguments of the parties.

      (b)  Each party may, within ten days of being served with the presiding officer's recommended decision, submit to the Comptroller comments on the recommended decision.

      (c)  Within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing or, if the petitioner has waived an oral hearing, within 60 days from the date fixed for the hearing, the Comptroller will notify the petitioner by registered mail, or electronic mail or other electronic means if the petitioner consents, whether the suspension or removal from office or prohibition from participation in any manner in the affairs of any depository institution will be affirmed, terminated, or modified. The Comptroller's decision must include a statement of reasons supporting the decision. The Comptroller's decision is a final and unappealable order.

      (d)  A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge or charges on which a notice of suspension was based does not preclude the Comptroller from thereafter instituting removal proceedings pursuant to section 8(e) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)) and subpart A of this part.

      (e)  A removal or prohibition by order remains in effect until terminated by the Comptroller. A suspension or prohibition by notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is disposed of or until terminated by the Comptroller.

      (f)  A suspended or removed individual may petition the Comptroller to reconsider the decision any time after the expiration of a 12-month period from the date of the decision, but no petition for reconsideration may be made within 12 months of a previous petition. The petition must state specifically the relief sought and the grounds therefor, and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and any other documentation the petitioner wishes to have considered. The Comptroller is not required to grant a hearing on the petition for reconsideration.

The only issuers covered by this section are national banks and Federal savings associations whose securities are registered, or which may be subject to registration, pursuant to section 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78(g)). The Comptroller may deny an application for exemption without a hearing.

      (b)  An issuer or an individual (officer, director, or shareholder) may submit a written application for an exemption order to Bank Advisory, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219. The application must specify the type of exemption sought and the reasons for the exemption, including an explanation of why an exemption would not be inconsistent with the public interest or the protection of investors. Bank Advisory will inform the applicant in writing whether a hearing will be held to consider the matter.

      (c)  Upon being informed that an application will be considered at a hearing, the applicant must publish a notice one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the issuer's main office is located. The notice must state: The name and title of any individual applicants; the type of exemption sought; the fact that a hearing will be held; and a statement that interested persons may submit to Bank Advisory, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219 within 30 days from the date of the newspaper notice, written comments concerning the application and a written request for an opportunity to be heard. The applicant must promptly provide a copy of the notice to Bank Advisory and to the national bank's or Federal savings association's shareholders in the same manner as is customary for shareholder communications.

      (d) —(1)  The adjudicative provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, formal rules of evidence, and subpart A of this part do not apply to hearings conducted under this section, except as provided in § 19.100.

      (2)  Following the comment period, the Comptroller will send a notice that fixes a date, time, and place for hearing to each applicant and to any person who has requested an opportunity to be heard.

      (3)  The Comptroller will designate a presiding officer to conduct the hearing. The presiding officer must determine all procedural questions not governed by this section and may limit the number of witnesses and impose time and presentation limitations as are deemed reasonable. At the conclusion of the informal hearing, the presiding officer must issue a recommended decision to the Comptroller as to whether the exemption should be issued. The decision must include a summary of the facts and arguments of the parties.

      (4)  Each applicant and any person who has requested an opportunity to be heard may attend the hearing with or without counsel. The hearing will be open to the public. In addition, each applicant and any other hearing participant may introduce oral testimony through such witnesses as the presiding officer may permit.

      (5)  (i) Each applicant may present an opening statement of a length decided by the presiding officer. Each of the hearing participants, or one among them selected with the approval of the presiding officer, may then present an opening statement. The opening statement should summarize concisely what each applicant and participant intends to show.

      (ii) Each applicant will have an opportunity to make an oral presentation of facts and materials or submit written materials for the record. One or more of the hearing participants may make an oral presentation or a written submission.

      (iii) After the above presentations, each applicant, followed by one or more of the hearing participants, may make concise summary statements reviewing their position.

      (6)  The obtaining and use of witnesses is the responsibility of the parties afforded the hearing. All witnesses must be present on their own volition, but any person appearing as a witness may be questioned by each applicant, any hearing participant, and the presiding officer. Witnesses must be sworn unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness.

      (7)  The presiding officer may exclude data or materials deemed to be improper or irrelevant. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. Documentary material must be of a size consistent with ease of handling and filing. The presiding officer may determine the number of copies that must be furnished for purposes of the hearing.

      (8)  Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for their own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner in which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.

      (9)  The OCC will arrange a transcript of each proceeding with all expenses, including the furnishing of a copy to the presiding officer by electronic means or otherwise, paid by the applicant or applicants.

      (e)  Following the conclusion of the hearing and the submission of the record and the presiding officer's recommended decision to the Comptroller for decision, the Comptroller will notify each applicant and all persons who have so requested in writing of the final disposition of the application. Exemptions granted must be in the form of an order that specifies the type of exemption granted and its terms and conditions.

    Subparts E through G—Reserved

    Subpart H—Change in Bank Control

      § 19.160   Scope.

#### § § 19.160

      (a)  This subpart governs the procedures for a hearing requested by a person who has filed a notice that has been disapproved by the OCC for a change in control of:

      (1) An insured national bank or Federal savings association pursuant to section 7(j) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)) and 12 CFR 5.50; or

      (2) An uninsured national bank pursuant to 12 CFR 5.50.

      (b)  Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, the rules in subpart A set forth the procedures applicable to requests for OCC hearings under this subpart.

      § 19.161   Hearing process.

#### § § 19.161

      (a)  Pursuant to 12 CFR 5.50(f)(6), following receipt of a notice of disapproval of a proposed acquisition of control of a national bank or Federal savings association, a filer may request a hearing by the OCC on the proposed acquisition. A hearing request must:

      (1) Be in writing; and

      (2) Be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the OCC within ten days after service on the filer of the notice of disapproval. If a filer fails to request a hearing with a timely written request, the notice of disapproval constitutes a final and unappealable order.

      (b)  Following receipt of a hearing request, the Comptroller will issue, within 20 days, an order that sets forth:

      (1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the OCC's jurisdiction over the proceeding;

      (2) The matters of fact or law upon which the disapproval is based; and

      (3) The requirement for filing an answer to the hearing order with OFIA within 20 days after service of the hearing order.

      (c)  An answer to a hearing order must specifically deny those portions of the order that are disputed. Those portions of the order that the filer does not specifically deny are deemed admitted by the filer. Any hearing under this subpart is limited to those portions of the order that are specifically denied.

      (d)  Failure of a filer to file an answer within 20 days after service of the hearing order constitutes a waiver of the filer's right to appear and contest the allegations in the hearing order. If a filer does not file a timely answer, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the hearing order. Any final order issued by the Comptroller based upon a filer's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent and is a final and unappealable order.

    Subpart I—Discovery Depositions and Subpoenas

      § 19.170   Discovery depositions.

#### § § 19.170

      (a)  In any proceeding instituted under or subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part, a party may take the deposition of a fact witness, an expert, or a hybrid fact-expert where there is need for the deposition. A fact witness is a person, including another party, who has direct knowledge of matters that are non-privileged and of material relevance to the proceeding. A hybrid fact-expert witness is a fact witness who will also provide relevant expert opinion testimony based on the witness' training and experience. The deposition of experts is limited to those experts who are expected to testify at the hearing.

      (1)  A party must produce an expert report for any testifying expert or hybrid fact-expert witness before the witness' deposition. Unless otherwise provided by the ALJ, the party must produce this report at least 20 days prior to any deposition of the expert or hybrid fact-expert witness.

      (2)  Respondents, collectively, are limited to a combined total of five depositions from fact witnesses and hybrid fact-expert witnesses. Enforcement Counsel are limited to a combined total of five depositions from fact witnesses and hybrid fact-expert witnesses. A party is entitled to take a deposition of each expert witness designated by an opposing party.

      (b)  A party desiring to take a deposition must give reasonable notice in writing to the deponent and to every other party to the proceeding. The notice must state the time, manner, and place for taking the deposition, and the name and address of the person to be deposed.

      (1)  A deposition notice may require the witness to be deposed at any place within a State, territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment, or such other convenient place as agreed by the noticing party and the witness.

      (2)  The parties may stipulate, or the ALJ may order, that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means.

      (c)  A party may take depositions at any time after the commencement of the proceeding, but no later than 20 days before the scheduled hearing date, except with permission of the ALJ for good cause shown.

      (d)  The witness must be duly sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the ALJ, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the deponent. Each party will have the right to examine the witness with respect to all matters that are non-privileged and of material relevance to the proceeding and of which the witness has factual, direct, and personal knowledge. Objections to questions or exhibits must be in short form and must state the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or exhibits is not a waiver except where the grounds for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented.

      (e) —(1)  The party taking the deposition must have a certified court reporter record the witness' testimony:

      (i) By stenotype machine or electronic means, such as by sound or video recording device;

      (ii) Upon agreement of the parties, by any other method; or

      (iii) For good cause and with leave of the ALJ, by any other method.

      (2)  The party taking the deposition must bear the cost of recording and transcribing the witness' testimony.

      (3)  Unless the parties agree that a transcription is not necessary, the court reporter must provide a transcript of the witness' testimony to the party taking the deposition and must make a copy of the transcript available to each party upon payment by that party of the cost of the copy.

      (f)  At any time after notice of a deposition has been given, a party may file a motion for the issuance of a protective order. Such protective order may prohibit, terminate, or limit the scope or manner of the taking of a deposition. The ALJ may grant a protective order upon a showing of sufficient grounds, including that the deposition:

      (1) Is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome;

      (2) Involves privileged, irrelevant, or immaterial matters;

      (3) Involves unwarranted attempts to pry into a party's preparation for trial; or

      (4) Is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as to unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress the witness.

      (g)  Deposition witnesses, including expert witnesses, must be paid the same expenses in the same manner as are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States in proceedings in which the United States is a party. Expenses in accordance with this paragraph (g) must be paid by the party seeking to take the deposition.

      § 19.171   Deposition subpoenas.

#### § § 19.171

      (a)  At the request of a party, the ALJ may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a discovery deposition under § 19.170. The attendance of a witness may be required from any place in any State, territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia or as otherwise permitted by law.

      (b) —(1)  The party requesting the subpoena must serve it on the person named therein, or on that person's counsel, by any of the methods identified in § 19.11(d).

      (2)  The party serving the subpoena must file proof of service with the ALJ, unless the ALJ issues an order indicating the filing of proof of service is not required.

      (c)  A person named in a subpoena, or any party, may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A statement of the reasons for the motion must accompany it and a copy of the motion must be served on the party that requested the subpoena. The motion must be made prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena and not more than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena, or if the subpoena is served within 15 days of the hearing, within five days after the date of service.

      (d)  Enforcement of a deposition subpoena must be in accordance with the procedures of § 19.27(d).

      § 19.182   Order to conduct a formal investigation.

#### § § 19.182

      A formal investigation begins with the issuance of an order signed by the Comptroller. The order must designate the person or persons empowered by the Comptroller to conduct the investigation. These persons are authorized, among other things, to administer oaths and affirmations, to take or cause to be taken testimony under oath, and to issue or modify subpoenas, including subpoenas  as to any matter under investigation by the Comptroller. Upon application and for good cause shown, the Comptroller may limit, modify, withdraw, or terminate the order at any stage of the proceedings.

      (b)  Any person who, in a formal investigation, is compelled to appear and testify, or who appears and testifies by request or permission of the OCC, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. The right to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel means the right of a person testifying to have an attorney present at all times while testifying and to have the attorney:

      (1) Advise the person before, during, and after the conclusion of testimony;

      (2) Question the person, on the record, briefly at the conclusion of testimony for the purpose of clarifying any of the answers given; and

      (c)  Any person who has given or will give testimony and counsel representing the person may be excluded from the proceedings during the taking of testimony of any other person at the discretion of the OCC or the OCC's designated representatives. Neither attorney(s) for the institution(s) affiliated with the testifying person nor attorneys for any other interested persons have any right to be present during the testimony of any person not personally represented by such attorney.

      (d)  Any person who is compelled to give testimony is entitled to inspect any transcript that has been made of the testimony but may not obtain a copy if the OCC or the OCC's designated representatives conducting the proceedings determine that the contents should not be disclosed.

      § 19.184   Service of subpoena and payment of witness expenses.

      § 19.185   Dilatory, obstructionist, or insubordinate conduct.

#### § § 19.185

      Any OCC designated representative conducting an investigative proceeding will report to the Comptroller any instances where any person has engaged in dilatory, obstructionist, or insubordinate conduct during the course of the proceeding or any other instance involving a violation of this part. The Comptroller may take such action as the circumstances warrant, including exclusion of the offending individual or individuals from participation in the proceedings.

      (2) No sanction authorized by this section, other than refusal to accept late filings, will be imposed without prior notice to all parties and an opportunity for any party against whom sanctions would be imposed to be heard. Such opportunity to be heard may be on such notice, and the response may be in such form as the ALJ or other presiding officer directs.

      § 19.197   Initiation of disciplinary proceeding.

#### § § 19.197

      (a)  An individual, including any employee of the OCC, who has reason to believe that an individual practicing before the OCC in a representative capacity has engaged in any conduct that would serve as a basis for censure, suspension, or debarment under this subpart, may make a report thereof and forward it to the OCC or to such person as may be delegated responsibility for such matters by the Comptroller.

      (b)  Upon receipt of information regarding an individual's qualification to practice before the OCC, the Comptroller may, after giving the individual notice and opportunity to respond, censure such individual.

      (c)  When the Comptroller has reason to believe that any individual who practices before the OCC in a representative capacity has engaged in conduct that would serve as a basis for censure, suspension, or debarment under § 19.192, the Comptroller may, after giving the individual notice and opportunity to respond, institute a formal disciplinary proceeding against such individual. The proceeding will be conducted pursuant to § 19.199 and initiated by a complaint that names the individual as a respondent and is signed by the Comptroller. Except in cases of willfulness, or when time, the nature of the proceeding, or the public interest do not permit, a proceeding under this section may not be commenced until the respondent has been informed, in writing, of the facts or conduct that warrant institution of a proceeding and the respondent has been accorded the opportunity to comply with all lawful requirements or take whatever action may be necessary to remedy the conduct that is the basis for the commencement of the proceeding.

      § 19.198   Conferences.

#### § § 19.198

      (a)  The Comptroller may confer with a proposed respondent concerning allegations of misconduct or other grounds for censure, debarment, or suspension, regardless of whether a proceeding for censure, debarment, or suspension has been commenced. If a conference results in a stipulation in connection with a proceeding in which the individual is the respondent, the stipulation may be entered in the record at the request of either party to the proceeding.

      (b)  In order to avoid the institution of, or a decision in, a debarment or suspension proceeding, a person who practices before the OCC may consent to suspension or debarment from practice. At the discretion of the Comptroller, the individual may be suspended or debarred in accordance with the consent offered.

      § 19.199   Proceedings under this subpart.

#### § § 19.199

      Any hearing held under this subpart is held before an ALJ pursuant to procedures set forth in subpart A of this part. The Comptroller will appoint a person to represent the OCC in the hearing. Any person having prior involvement in the matter that is the basis for the suspension or debarment proceeding is disqualified from representing the OCC in the hearing. The hearing will be closed to the public unless the Comptroller, on the Comptroller's initiative or on the request of a party, otherwise directs. The ALJ will issue a recommended decision to the Comptroller, who will issue the final decision and order. The Comptroller may censure, debar, or suspend an individual, or take such other disciplinary action as the Comptroller deems appropriate.

      § 19.200   Effect of debarment, suspension, or censure.

#### § § 19.200

      (a)  If the final order against the respondent is for debarment, the individual may not practice before the OCC unless otherwise permitted to do so by the Comptroller pursuant to § 19.201.

      (b)  If the final order against the respondent is for suspension, the individual may not practice before the OCC during the period of suspension.

      (c)  If the final order against the respondent is for censure, the individual may be permitted to practice before the OCC, but such individual's future representations may be subject to conditions designed to promote high standards of conduct. If a written letter of censure is issued, a copy will be maintained in the OCC's files.

      (d)  Upon the issuance of a final order for suspension or debarment, the Comptroller will give notice of the order to appropriate officers and employees of the OCC and to interested departments and agencies of the Federal government. The Comptroller will also give notice to the appropriate authorities of the state in which any debarred or suspended individual is or was licensed to practice.

      § 19.201   Petition for reinstatement.

#### § § 19.201

      At the expiration of the period of time designated in the order of debarment, the Comptroller may entertain a petition for reinstatement from any person debarred from practice before the OCC. The Comptroller may grant reinstatement only if satisfied that the petitioner is likely to act in accordance with the regulations in this part, and that granting reinstatement would not be contrary to the public interest. Any request for reinstatement is limited to written submissions unless the Comptroller, at the Comptroller's discretion, affords the petitioner a hearing.

    Subpart L—Equal Access to Justice Act

      § 19.205   Authority and scope; waiver.

#### § § 19.205

      (a)  This subpart implements section 203 of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) (5 U.S.C. 504). EAJA provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities that are parties in certain administrative proceedings (adversary adjudications) before agencies of the Government of the United States. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. However, no presumption under this subpart arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified because the agency did not prevail.

      (b)  The types of adversary adjudications covered by this subpart are those proceedings listed in §§ 19.1, 19.110, 19.120, 19.190, 19.230, and 19.241.

      (c)  After reasonable notice to the parties, the presiding officer or the OCC may waive, for good cause shown, any provision contained in this subpart as long as the waiver is consistent with the terms and purpose of EAJA.

      § 19.206   Definitions.

#### § § 19.206

      For purposes of this subpart:

      (a)  means an adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the OCC is represented by Enforcement Counsel.

      (b)  means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of a proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable both within the OCC and to the courts.

      (c)  means a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), that is:

      (1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; or

      (2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated, and which had not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; except that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, may be a party regardless of the net worth of the organization or cooperative association. The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and any of its affiliates must be aggregated when determining the applicability of this paragraph (c).

      (d)  means, in addition to the position taken by the OCC in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the OCC upon which the adversary adjudication is based, except that fees and other expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portion of the adversary adjudication in which the party has unreasonably protracted the proceedings.

      (e)  means the official, whether the official is designated as an ALJ or otherwise, that presided over the adversary adjudication or the official that presides over an EAJA proceeding.

      § 19.207   Application requirements.

#### § § 19.207

      (a)  A party seeking an award under this subpart must file an application with the OCC within 30 days after the OCC's final disposition of the adversary adjudication.

      (b)  An application for an award of fees and expenses under this section must:

      (1) Identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought;

      (2) Show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the OCC that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified;

      (3) State the basis for the applicant's belief that the OCC position was not substantially justified;

      (4) Unless the applicant is an individual, state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business;

      (5) Show that the applicant meets the definition of “party” in § 19.206(c), including documentation of its net worth pursuant to § 19.208, if applicable;

      (6) State the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought, as documented pursuant to § 19.209;

      (7) Be signed by the applicant if the applicant is an individual or by an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant;

      (8) Any other matter the applicant wishes the OCC to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made; and

      (9) Contain or be accompanied by a written verification under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

      (c)  Upon receipt of an EAJA application, the OCC will, if feasible, refer the matter to the official who heard the underlying adversary adjudication.

      § 19.208   Net worth exhibit.

#### § § 19.208

      (a)  Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and, where appropriate, any of its affiliates at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated. Except as otherwise provided in this section, this exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. A presiding officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.

      (1) An unaudited financial statement is acceptable for individual applicants as long as the statement provides a reliable basis for evaluation, unless the presiding officer or the OCC otherwise requires. Financial statements or reports filed with or reported to a Federal or State agency before the initiation of the adversary adjudication for other purposes and accurate as of a date not more than three months prior to the initiation of the proceeding are acceptable in establishing net worth as of the time of the initiation of the proceeding, unless the presiding officer or the OCC otherwise requires.

      (2) In the case of applicants or affiliates that are not banks or savings associations, net worth will be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the excess of total assets over total liabilities as of the date the underlying proceeding was initiated.

      (3) If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a bank or a savings association, the portion of the statement of net worth that relates to the bank or the savings association must consist of a copy of the bank's or savings association's last Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed before the initiation of the adversary adjudication. Net worth will be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the total equity capital as reported, in conformity with applicable instructions and guidelines, on the bank's or the savings association's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the last reporting date before the initiation of the proceeding.

      (b)  Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may request that the documents be filed under seal or otherwise be treated as confidential.

      § 19.209   Documentation of fees and expenses.

#### § § 19.209

      The application must be accompanied by adequate documentation of the fees and expenses incurred after initiation of the adversary adjudication, including the cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project. An application seeking an increase in fees to account for inflation pursuant to § 19.215(d)(1)(i) also must include adequate documentation of the change in the consumer price index for the attorney or agent's locality. The applicant must submit a separate itemized statement for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The presiding officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses claimed.

      § 19.210   Filing and service of documents.

#### § § 19.210

      Any application for an award, or any accompanying documentation related to an application, must be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in accordance with § 19.11, except as provided in § 19.208(b) for confidential financial information.

      § 19.211   Answer to application.

#### § § 19.211

      (a)  Except as provided in § 19.213, Enforcement Counsel may file an answer to an application within 30 days after service of the application. Unless Enforcement Counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement under § 19.213, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

      (b)  The answer must explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the Enforcement Counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, Enforcement Counsel must include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 19.214.

      § 19.212   Reply.

#### § § 19.212

      Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant must include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 19.214.

      § 19.213   Settlement.

#### § § 19.213

      The applicant and Enforcement Counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with § 19.15. If a prevailing party and Enforcement Counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application must be filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement of an underlying proceeding provides that each side must bear its own expenses and the settlement is accepted, no application may be filed. If, after an application is filed, Enforcement Counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement will extend, under § 19.211, the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon request by Enforcement Counsel and the applicant.

      § 19.214   Further proceedings.

#### § § 19.214

      (a)  At the request of either the applicant or Enforcement Counsel, or on the presiding officer's own initiative, the presiding officer may, if necessary for a full and fair decision on the application, order the filing of additional written submissions; hold an informal conference or oral argument; or allow for discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing with respect to issues other than whether the OCC's position was substantially justified (such as those involving the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees or expenses). Any written submissions must be made, oral argument held, discovery conducted, and evidentiary hearing held as promptly as possible so as not to delay a decision on the application for fees.

      (b)  A request for further proceedings under this section must specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and must explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

      § 19.215   Decision.

#### § § 19.215

      (a)  The presiding officer must determine whether the position of the OCC was substantially justified on the basis of the administrative record as a whole of the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.

      (b)  The presiding officer in a proceeding under this subpart will issue a recommended decision, in writing, on the application within 90 days after the time for filing a reply or, when further proceedings are held, within 90 days after completion of proceedings.

      (c)  The decision on the application must include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and, if applicable, an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision also must include, if applicable, findings on whether Enforcement Counsel's or the OCC's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly and unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.

      (d) —(1)  Awards under this subpart may include the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses; the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project; and reasonable attorney or agent fees. The applicant must have incurred these expenses, costs, and fees after initiation of the adversary adjudication subject to the EAJA application. The presiding officer will base awards on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, even if the services were provided without charge or at reduced rate to the applicant, except that:

      (i) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this subpart may exceed the hourly rate specified in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A) except to account for inflation since the last update of the statute's maximum award upon the request of the applicant as documented in the application pursuant to § 19.209 or if a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee; and

      (ii) No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the OCC pays expert witnesses.

      (2)  In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness the presiding officer should consider:

      (i) If in private practice, the attorney's, agent's, or witness' customary fee for similar services;

      (ii) If an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the attorney's, agent's, or witness' services;

      (iii) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily perform services;

      (iv) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

      (v) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and

      (vi) Any other factors that may bear on the value of the services provided.

      (3)  The presiding officer may award the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of the applicant to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services and the presiding officer finds that the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

      (4)  A presiding officer may reduce the amount to be awarded, or deny any award, to the extent that the party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.

      (e)  The Comptroller will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the presiding officer for further proceedings in accordance with § 19.40.

      § 19.216   Agency review.

#### § § 19.216

      Either the applicant or Enforcement Counsel may seek review of the presiding officer's decision on the fee application, in accordance with § 19.39.

      § 19.217   Judicial review.

#### § § 19.217

      An applicant may seek judicial review of final agency decisions on awards made under this section as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).

      § 19.218   Stay of decision concerning award.

#### § § 19.218

      Any proceedings on an application for fees under this subpart will be automatically stayed until the OCC's final disposition of the decision on which the application is based and either the time period for seeking judicial review expires, or if review has been sought, until final disposition is made by a court and no further judicial review is available.

      § 19.219   Payment of award.

#### § § 19.219

      (a)  An applicant seeking payment of an award must submit to the OCC's Litigation Group a copy of the OCC's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. Applicants should send the submissions to: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219, Attention: Director, Litigation Group.

      (b)  The OCC will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 90 days.

    Subpart M—Procedures for Reclassifying an Insured Depository Institution Based on Criteria Other Than Capital Under Prompt Corrective Action

      § 19.220   Scope.

#### § § 19.220

      This subpart applies to the procedures afforded to any _insured depository institution_ that has been reclassified to a lower capital category by a notice or order issued by the OCC pursuant to section 38 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and 12 CFR part 6 (prompt corrective action). For purposes of this subpart,  means an insured national bank, an insured Federal savings association, an insured Federal savings bank, or an insured Federal branch of a foreign bank.

      § 19.221   Reclassification of an insured depository institution based on unsafe or unsound condition or practice.

#### § § 19.221

      (a) —(1)  (i) Pursuant to § 6.4 of this chapter, the OCC may reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized insured depository institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if:

      (A) The OCC determines that the insured depository institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or

      (B) The OCC deems the insured depository institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.

      (ii) Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) is referred to in this subpart as “reclassification.”

      (2)  Prior to taking action pursuant to § 6.4 of this chapter, the OCC will issue and serve on the insured depository institution a written notice of the OCC's intention to reclassify the insured depository institution.

      (b)  A notice of intention to reclassify an insured depository institution based on unsafe or unsound condition will include:

      (1) A statement of the insured depository institution's capital measures and capital levels and the category to which the insured depository institution would be reclassified;

      (2) The reasons for reclassification of the insured depository institution; and

      (3) The date by which the insured depository institution subject to the notice of reclassification may file with the OCC a written response to the proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which must be at least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the insured depository institution or other relevant circumstances.

      (c)  An insured depository institution may file a written response to a notice of proposed reclassification within the time period set by the OCC. The response should include:

      (1) An explanation of why the insured depository institution is not in unsafe or unsound condition or otherwise should not be reclassified; and

      (2) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the insured depository institution or company regarding the reclassification.

      (d)  Failure by an insured depository institution to file, within the specified time period, a written response with the OCC to a notice of proposed reclassification will constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and will constitute consent to the reclassification.

      (e)  The response may include a request for an informal hearing before the OCC under this section. If the insured depository institution desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the insured depository institution must include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. A request to present oral testimony or witnesses must specify the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing will constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to request the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses will constitute a waiver of any right to present oral testimony or witnesses.

      (f)  Upon receipt of a timely written request that includes a request for a hearing, the OCC will issue an order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days after receipt of the request, unless the OCC allows further time at the request of the insured depository institution. The hearing will be held in Washington, DC or at such other place as may be designated by the OCC before a presiding officer(s) designated by the OCC to conduct the hearing.

      (g)  (1) The insured depository institution has the right to introduce relevant written materials and to present oral argument at the hearing. The insured depository institution may introduce oral testimony and present witnesses only if expressly authorized by the OCC or the presiding officer(s). Neither the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications required by statute to be determined on the record nor the Uniform Rules apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the OCC orders that such procedures will apply.

      (2) The informal hearing will be recorded and a transcript furnished to the insured depository institution upon request and payment of the cost thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn unless specifically requested by a party or the presiding officer(s). If so requested, and by stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness. The presiding officer(s) may ask questions of any witness.

      (3) Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for its own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner by which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.

      (4) The presiding officer(s) may order that the hearing be continued for a reasonable period (normally five business days) following completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional written submissions to the hearing record.

      (h)  Within 20 calendar days following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are closed, the presiding officer(s) will make a recommendation to the OCC on the reclassification.

      (i)  Not later than 60 calendar days after the date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no hearing was requested, the OCC will decide whether to reclassify the insured depository institution and notify the insured depository institution of the OCC's decision.

      § 19.222   Request for rescission of reclassification.

#### § § 19.222

      Any insured depository institution that has been reclassified under part 6 of this chapter and this subpart, may, upon a change in circumstances, request in writing that the OCC reconsider the reclassification, and may propose that the reclassification be rescinded and that any directives issued in connection with the reclassification be modified, rescinded, or removed. Unless otherwise ordered by the OCC, the insured depository institution will remain subject to the reclassification and to any directives issued in connection with that reclassification while such request is pending before the OCC.

    Subpart N—Order To Dismiss a Director or Senior Executive Officer Under Prompt Corrective Action

      § 19.230   Scope.

#### § § 19.230

      This subpart applies to informal hearings afforded to any director or senior executive officer dismissed pursuant to an order issued under section 38 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and 12 CFR part 6 (prompt corrective action). For purposes of this subpart,  means an insured national bank, an insured Federal savings association, an insured Federal savings bank, or an insured Federal branch of a foreign bank.

      § 19.231   Order to dismiss a director or senior executive officer.

#### § § 19.231

      (a)  When the OCC issues and serves a directive on an insured depository institution pursuant to subpart B of 12 CFR part 6 requiring the insured depository institution to dismiss from office any director or senior executive officer under section 38(f)(2)(F)(ii) of the FDIA, the OCC will also serve a copy of the directive, or the relevant portions of the directive where appropriate, upon the person to be dismissed.

      (b) —(1)  A director or senior executive officer who has been served with a directive under paragraph (a) of this section (Respondent) may file a written request for reinstatement. The Respondent must file this request for reinstatement within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the OCC directive, unless further time is allowed by the OCC at the request of the Respondent. Failure by the Respondent to file a written request for reinstatement with the OCC within the specified time period will constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and will constitute consent to the dismissal.

      (2)  The request for reinstatement must include reasons why the Respondent should be reinstated and may include a request for an informal hearing before the OCC or its designee under this section. If the Respondent desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the Respondent must include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. The request to present oral testimony or witnesses must specify the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing will constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to request the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses will constitute a waiver of any right or opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses.

      (3)  Unless otherwise ordered by the OCC, the dismissal will remain in effect while a request for reinstatement is pending.

      (c)  Upon receipt of a timely written request from a Respondent for an informal hearing on the portion of a directive requiring an insured depository institution to dismiss from office any director or senior executive officer, the OCC will issue an order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days after receipt of the request, unless the OCC allows further time at the request of the Respondent.

      (d) —(1)  A Respondent may appear at the hearing personally or through counsel. A Respondent has the right to introduce relevant written materials and to present oral argument at the hearing.

      (2)  Neither the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications required by statute to be determined on the record nor the Uniform Rules apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the OCC orders that such procedures will apply.

      (3)  Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for its own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner in which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.

      (4)  The informal hearing will be recorded and a transcript furnished to the Respondent upon request and payment of the cost thereof.

      (5)  A Respondent may introduce oral testimony and present witnesses only if expressly authorized by the OCC or the presiding officer(s). Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested by a party or the presiding officer(s). If so requested, and by stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness. The presiding officer(s) may ask questions of any witness.

      (6)  The presiding officer(s) may order that the hearing be continued for a reasonable period (normally five business days) following completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional written submissions to the hearing record.

      (e)  A Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that their continued employment by or service with the insured depository institution would materially strengthen the insured depository institution's ability:

      (1) To become adequately capitalized, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of the insured depository institution's capital level or failure to submit or implement a capital restoration plan; and

      (2) To correct the unsafe or unsound condition or unsafe or unsound practice, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of classification of the insured depository institution based on supervisory criteria other than capital, pursuant to section 38(g) of the FDIA.

      (f)  Within 20 calendar days following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are closed, the presiding officer(s) will make a recommendation to the OCC concerning the Respondent's request for reinstatement with the insured depository institution.

      (g)  Not later than 60 calendar days after the date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no hearing was requested, the OCC will grant or deny the request for reinstatement and notify the Respondent of the OCC's decision. If the OCC denies the request for reinstatement, the OCC will set forth in the notification the reasons for the OCC's action.

    Subpart O—Civil Money Penalty Inflation Adjustments

      § 19.240   Inflation adjustments.

#### § § 19.240

      (a)  The OCC is required by statute to annually adjust for inflation the maximum amount of each civil money penalty within its jurisdiction to administer. The OCC calculates the inflation adjustment by multiplying the maximum dollar amount of the civil money penalty for the previous calendar year by the cost-of-living inflation adjustment multiplier provided annually by the Office of Management and Budget and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.

      (b)  The OCC will publish notice in the  of the maximum penalties which may be assessed on an annual basis on or before January 15 of each calendar year based on the formula in paragraph (a) of this section, for penalties assessed on, or after, the date of publication of the most recent notice related to conduct occurring on, or after, November 2, 2015.

      § 19.243   Removal, suspension, or debarment.

#### § § 19.243

      (a) —(1)  The Comptroller may remove, suspend, or debar an independent public accountant from performing audit services for insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks that are subject to section 36 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831m) if, after service of a notice of intention and opportunity for hearing in the matter, the Comptroller finds that the accountant:

      (i) Lacks the requisite qualifications to perform audit services;

      (ii) Has knowingly or recklessly engaged in conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards, including those standards and conflicts of interest provisions applicable to accountants through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Law 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002) (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and developed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission;

      (iii) Has engaged in negligent conduct in the form of:

      (A) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted; or

      (B) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to perform audit services;

      (iv) Has knowingly or recklessly given false or misleading information, or knowingly or recklessly participated in any way in the giving of false or misleading information, to the OCC or any officer or employee of the OCC;

      (v) Has engaged in, or aided and abetted, a material and knowing or reckless violation of any provision of the Federal banking or securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other law;

      (vi) Has been removed, suspended, or debarred from practice before any Federal or State agency regulating the banking, insurance, or securities industries, other than by an action listed in § 19.244, on grounds relevant to the provision of audit services; or

      (vii) Is suspended or debarred for cause from practice as an accountant by any duly constituted licensing authority of any State, possession, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia.

      (2)  If the Comptroller determines that there is good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment of a member or employee of an accounting firm under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Comptroller also may remove, suspend, or debar such firm or one or more offices of such firm. In considering whether to remove, suspend, or debar a firm or an office thereof, and the term of any sanction against a firm under this section, the Comptroller may consider, for example:

      (i) The gravity, scope, or repetition of the act or failure to act that constitutes good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment;

      (ii) The adequacy of, and adherence to, applicable policies, practices, or procedures for the accounting firm's conduct of its business and the performance of audit services;

      (iii) The selection, training, supervision, and conduct of members or employees of the accounting firm involved in the performance of audit services;

      (iv) The extent to which managing partners or senior officers of the accounting firm have participated, directly, or indirectly through oversight or review, in the act or failure to act; and

      (v) The extent to which the accounting firm has, since the occurrence of the act or failure to act, implemented corrective internal controls to prevent its recurrence.

      (3)  An order of removal, suspension (including an immediate suspension), or debarment may, at the discretion of the Comptroller, be made applicable to a particular insured national bank, insured Federal savings association, or insured Federal branch of a foreign bank or class of insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks.

      (4)  The remedies provided in this subpart are in addition to any other remedies the OCC may have under any other applicable provisions of law, rule, or regulation.

      (b) —(1)  The Comptroller may initiate a proceeding to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services by issuing a written notice of intention to take such action that names the individual or firm as a respondent and describes the nature of the conduct that constitutes good cause for such action.

      (2)  An accountant or firm named as a respondent in the notice issued under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request a hearing on the allegations in the notice. Hearings conducted under this paragraph (b)(2) will be conducted in the same manner as other hearings under the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in subpart A of this part, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (c) —(1)  If the Comptroller serves a written notice of intention to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services, the Comptroller may, with due regard for the public interest and without a preliminary hearing, immediately suspend such accountant or firm from performing audit services for insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks, if the Comptroller:

      (i) Has a reasonable basis to believe that the accountant or firm has engaged in conduct (specified in the notice served on the accountant or firm under paragraph (b) of this section) that would constitute grounds for removal, suspension, or debarment under paragraph (a) of this section;

      (ii) Determines that immediate suspension is necessary to avoid immediate harm to an insured depository institution or its depositors or to the depository system as a whole; and

      (iii) Serves such respondent with written notice of the immediate suspension.

      (2)  An immediate suspension notice issued under this paragraph (c)(2) will become effective upon service. Such suspension will remain in effect until the date the Comptroller dismisses the charges contained in the notice of intention, or the effective date of a final order of removal, suspension, or debarment issued by the Comptroller to the respondent.

      (3)  Any accountant or firm immediately suspended from performing audit services in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, within 10 calendar days after service of the notice of immediate suspension, file with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219 for a stay of such immediate suspension. If no petition is filed within 10 calendar days, the right to a petition is waived and the immediate suspension remains in effect pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (4)  Upon receipt of a stay petition, the Comptroller will designate a presiding officer who will fix a place and time (not more than 10 calendar days after receipt of the petition, unless further time is allowed by the presiding officer at the request of petitioner) at which the immediately suspended party may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials and oral argument. Any OCC employee engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions for the OCC in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, serve as a presiding officer or participate or advise in the decision of the presiding officer or of the OCC, except as witness or counsel in the proceeding. In the sole discretion of the presiding officer, upon a specific showing of compelling need, oral testimony of witnesses may also be presented. In hearings held pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) there will be no discovery and the provisions of §§ 19.6 through 19.12, 19.16, and 19.21 apply.

      (5)  Within 30 calendar days after the hearing, the presiding officer will issue a decision. The presiding officer will grant a stay upon a demonstration that a substantial likelihood exists of the respondent's success on the issues raised by the notice of intention and that, absent such relief, the respondent will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage. In the absence of such a demonstration, the presiding officer will notify the parties that the immediate suspension will be continued pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice.

      (6)  The parties may seek review of the presiding officer's decision by filing a petition for review with the presiding officer within 10 calendar days after service of the decision. Replies must be filed within 10 calendar days after the petition filing date. Upon receipt of a petition for review and any reply, the presiding officer will promptly certify the entire record to the Comptroller. Within 60 calendar days of the presiding officer's certification, the Comptroller will issue an order notifying the affected party whether or not the immediate suspension should be continued or reinstated. The order will state the basis of the Comptroller's decision.

      § 19.244   Automatic removal, suspension, or debarment.

#### § § 19.244

      (a) An independent public accountant or accounting firm may not perform audit services for insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks if the accountant or firm:

      (b)  An accountant or accounting firm that provides audit services to an insured national bank, insured Federal savings association, or insured Federal branch of a foreign bank must provide the Comptroller with written notice of:

      (1) Any currently effective order or other action described in § 19.243(a)(1)(vi) through (vii) or § 19.244(a)(2) and (3); and

      (2) Any currently effective action by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board under sections 105(c)(4)(C) or (G) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (15 U.S.C. 7215(c)(4)(C) or (G)).

      (c)  Written notice required by this paragraph (c) must be given no later than 15 calendar days following the effective date of an order or action, or 15 calendar days before an accountant or firm accepts an engagement to provide audit services, whichever date is earlier.

      § 19.246   Petition for reinstatement.

#### § § 19.246

      (a)  Unless otherwise ordered by the Comptroller, a petition for reinstatement by an independent public accountant, an accounting firm, or an office of a firm that was removed, suspended, or debarred under § 19.243 may be made in writing at any time. The request must contain a concise statement of the action requested. The Comptroller may require the applicant to submit additional information.

      (b)  A petitioner for reinstatement under this section may, in the sole discretion of the Comptroller, be afforded a hearing. The accountant or firm bears the burden of going forward with a petition and proving the grounds asserted in support of the petition. In reinstatement proceedings, the person seeking reinstatement bears the burden of going forward with an application and proving the grounds asserted in support of the application. The Comptroller may, in his sole discretion, direct that any reinstatement proceeding be limited to written submissions. The removal, suspension, or debarment will continue until the Comptroller, for good cause shown, has reinstated the petitioner or until the suspension period has expired. The filing of a petition for reinstatement will not stay the effectiveness of the removal, suspension, or debarment of an accountant or firm.

    Subpart B—Reports of Suspicious Activities

      § 21.11   Suspicious Activity Report.

#### § § 21.11

      (a)  This section ensures that national banks file a Suspicious Activity Report when they detect a known or suspected violation of Federal law or a suspicious transaction related to a money laundering activity or a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. This section applies to all national banks as well as any Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks licensed or chartered by the OCC.

      (b)  For the purposes of this section:

      (1)  means the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury.

      (2)  means any institution-affiliated party as that term is defined in sections 3(u) and 8(b)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(u) and 1818(b)(5)).

      (3)  means a Suspicious Activity Report.

      (c)  A national bank shall file a SAR with the appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies and the Department of the Treasury on the form prescribed by the OCC and in accordance with the form's instructions. The bank shall send the completed SAR to FinCEN in the following circumstances:

      (1)  Whenever the national bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank, where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, agents or other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in the commission of a criminal act, regardless of the amount involved in the violation.

      (2)  Whenever the national bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations or that it was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is determined prior to filing this report that the identified suspect or group of suspects has used an alias, then information regarding the true identity of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, such as drivers' license or social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, must be reported.

      (3)  Whenever the national bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank and involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or other assets where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, even though there is no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects.

      (4)  Any transaction (which for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4) means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, extension of credit, or purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at or through the national bank and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the bank knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:

      (i) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law;

      (ii) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or

      (iii) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the institution knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.

      (d)  A national bank is required to file a SAR no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a national bank may delay filing a SAR for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing, the financial institution shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and the OCC in addition to filing a timely SAR.

      (e)  National banks are encouraged to file a copy of the SAR with state and local law enforcement agencies where appropriate.

      (f)  (1) A national bank need not file a SAR for a robbery or burglary committed or attempted that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

      (2) A national bank need not file a SAR for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen securities if it files a report pursuant to the reporting requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.

      (g)  A national bank shall maintain a copy of any SAR filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of the filing of the SAR. Supporting documentation shall be identified and maintained by the bank as such, and shall be deemed to have been filed with the SAR. A national bank shall make all supporting documentation available to appropriate law enforcement agencies upon request.

      (h) —(1)  Whenever a national bank files a SAR pursuant to this section, the management of the bank shall promptly notify its board of directors, or a committee of directors or executive officers designated by the board of directors to receive notice.

      (2)  If the bank files a SAR pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and the suspect is a director or executive officer, the bank may not notify the suspect, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), but shall notify all directors who are not suspects.

      (i)  Failure to file a SAR in accordance with this section and the instructions may subject the national bank, its directors, officers, employees, agents, or other institution-affiliated parties to supervisory action.

      (j)  A national bank may obtain SARs and the Instructions from the appropriate OCC District Office listed in 12 CFR part 4.

      (k)  A SAR, and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, are confidential, and shall not be disclosed except as authorized in this paragraph (k).

      (1) —(i)  No national bank, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of a national bank, shall disclose a SAR or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR. Any national bank, and any director, officer, employee, or agent of any national bank that is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, shall decline to produce the SAR or such information, citing this section and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)(A)(i), and shall notify the following of any such request and the response thereto:

      (A) Director, Litigation Division, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and

      (B) The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

      (ii)  Provided that no person involved in any reported suspicious transaction is notified that the transaction has been reported, this paragraph (k)(1) shall not be construed as prohibiting:

      (A) The disclosure by a national bank, or any director, officer, employee or agent of a national bank of:

      () A SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, to the OCC, FinCEN, or any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency; or

      () The underlying facts, transactions, and documents upon which a SAR is based, including, but not limited to, disclosures:

      () To another f_i_nancial institution, or any director, officer, employee or agent of a financial institution, for the preparation of a joint SAR; or

      (2)  The OCC will not, and no officer, employee or agent of the OCC, shall disclose a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, except as necessary to fulfill official duties consistent with title II of the Bank Secrecy Act. For purposes of this section, official duties shall not include the disclosure of a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, in response to a request for use in a private legal proceeding or in response to a request for disclosure of non-public OCC information under 12 CFR 4.33.

      (m)  (1) The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may grant a national bank an exemption from the requirements of this section. A national bank requesting an exemption must submit a request in writing to the OCC. In reviewing such requests, the OCC will consider whether the exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act (if applicable) and safe and sound banking, and may consider other appropriate factors. Any exemption will apply only as expressly stated in the exemption. (A national bank requesting an exemption that also requires relief from the requirements of applicable regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR chapter X must submit a request in writing to both the OCC and FinCEN for approval.)

      (2) The OCC will respond in writing to a national bank that submits a request pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) of this section after considering whether the exemption is consistent with the factors in paragraph (m)(1) of this section. Any exemption granted by the OCC under paragraph (m)(1) of this section will continue for the time specified by the OCC.

      (3) The OCC may extend the period of time or may revoke an exemption granted under paragraph (m)(1) of this section. Exemptions or extensions may be revoked in the sole discretion of the OCC. Before revoking an exemption, the OCC will provide written notice to the national bank of the OCC's intention to revoke an exemption. Such notice will include the basis for the revocation and will provide an opportunity for the national bank to submit a response to the OCC. The OCC will consider any response before deciding whether or not to revoke an exemption and provide written notice to the national bank of the OCC's final decision to revoke an exemption.

      (4) With respect to requests for exemptions that will also require relief from the requirements of applicable regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR chapter X, upon receiving approval from both the OCC and FinCEN, the requestor will be relieved of its obligations under this section to the extent stated in such approvals.

    (i) The loan is an extension of credit primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes;

    (3)  The national bank or Federal savings association or the servicer acting on its behalf, must begin escrowing premiums and fees for flood insurance as soon as reasonably practicable after the bank or savings association, or servicer, receives the borrower's request to escrow.

#### § § 23.20

      Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) a national bank may invest in tangible or intangible personal property, including vehicles, manufactured homes, machinery, equipment, furniture, patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property, for the purpose of, or in connection with leasing that property, if the related lease is a conforming lease representing a noncancelable obligation of the lessee (notwithstanding the possible early termination of that lease).

      § 23.21   Estimated residual value.

#### § § 23.21

      (a)  A national bank's estimate of the residual value of the property that the bank relies upon to satisfy the requirements of a full-payout lease, for purposes of this subpart:

      (c)  A bank's calculations of estimated residual value in connection with leases of personal property to Federal, State, or local governmental entities may be based on future transactions or renewals that the bank reasonably anticipates will occur.

      (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas must include each county in which a bank or savings association has a main office, a branch, or a deposit-taking remote service facility, as well as the surrounding counties in which the bank or savings association has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans).

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each of a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas must consist of a single MSA, one or more contiguous counties within an MSA, or one or more contiguous counties within the nonmetropolitan area of a State.

      (c)  Each of a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas:

      (1) May not reflect illegal discrimination; and

      (2) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income census tracts. In determining whether a bank or savings association has arbitrarily excluded low- or moderate-income census tracts from a facility-based assessment area, the appropriate Federal banking agency takes into account the bank's or savings association's capacity and constraints, including its size and financial condition.

      (d)  Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a military bank or savings association whose customers are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate the entire United States and its territories as its sole facility-based assessment area.

      (e)  The appropriate Federal banking agency uses the facility-based assessment areas delineated by a bank or savings association in its evaluation of the bank's or savings association's CRA performance unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the facility-based assessment areas do not comply with the requirements of this section.

#### § § 25.17

      (a)  (1) Based upon the criteria described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a large bank or savings association must delineate retail lending assessment areas within which the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community pursuant to § 25.22.

      (2) A large bank or savings association is not required to delineate retail lending assessment areas for a particular calendar year if, in the prior two calendar years, the large bank or savings association originated or purchased within its facility-based assessment areas more than 80 percent of its home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the large bank or savings association as described in paragraph II.a.1 of appendix A to this part.

      (3) If, in a retail lending assessment area delineated pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the large bank or savings association did not originate or purchase any reported loans in any of the product lines that formed the basis of the retail lending assessment area delineation pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency will not consider the retail lending assessment area to have been delineated for that calendar year.

      (b)  (1) A large bank's or savings association's retail lending assessment area must consist of either:

      (i) The entirety of a single MSA (using the MSA boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation applies), excluding any counties inside the large bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas; or

      (A) Any counties included in the large bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas; and

      (B) Any counties in which the large bank or savings association did not originate any closed-end home mortgage loans or small business loans that are reported loans during that calendar year.

      (2) A retail lending assessment area may not extend beyond a State boundary unless the retail lending assessment area consists of counties in a multistate MSA.

      (c)  Subject to the geographic requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, a large bank or savings association must delineate, for a particular calendar year, a retail lending assessment area in any MSA or in the nonmetropolitan area of any State in which it originated:

      (1) At least 150 closed-end home mortgage loans that are reported loans in each year of the prior two calendar years; or

      (2) At least 400 small business loans that are reported loans in each year of the prior two calendar years.

      (d)  The appropriate Federal banking agency uses the retail lending assessment areas delineated by a large bank or savings association in its evaluation of the bank's or savings association's closed-end home mortgage lending and small business lending performance unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the retail lending assessment areas do not comply with the requirements of this section.

      § 25.18   Outside retail lending areas.

#### § § 25.18

      (a) —(1)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a large bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community in its outside retail lending area pursuant to § 25.22. However, the appropriate Federal banking agency will not evaluate a large bank or savings association in its outside retail lending area if it did not originate or purchase loans in any product lines in the outside retail lending area during the evaluation period.

      (2)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the record of an intermediate bank or savings association, or a small bank or savings association that opts to be evaluated under the Retail Lending Test, of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community in its outside retail lending area pursuant to § 25.22, for a particular calendar year, if:

      § 25.21   Evaluation of CRA performance in general.

#### § § 25.21

      (a) —(1)  To evaluate the performance of a large bank or savings association, the appropriate Federal banking agency applies the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22, the Retail Services and Products Test in § 25.23, the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24, and the Community Development Services Test in § 25.25.

      (2) —(i)  To evaluate the performance of an intermediate bank or savings association, the appropriate Federal banking agency applies the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22 and either the Intermediate Bank and Savings Association Community Development Test in § 25.30(a)(2) or, at the bank's or savings association's option, the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24.

      (ii)  If an intermediate bank or savings association opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the intermediate bank or savings association for the evaluation period preceding the bank's or savings association's next CRA examination pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24 and continues evaluations pursuant to this performance test for subsequent evaluation periods until the bank or savings association opts out. If an intermediate bank or savings association opts out of the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24, the appropriate Federal banking agency reverts to evaluating the bank or savings association pursuant to the Intermediate Bank and Savings Association Community Development Test in § 25.30(a)(2), starting with the evaluation period preceding the bank's or savings association's next CRA examination.

      (iii)  An intermediate bank or savings association may request additional consideration pursuant to § 25.30(b).

      (3) —(i)  To evaluate the performance of a small bank or savings association, the appropriate Federal banking agency applies the Small Bank and Savings Association Lending Test in § 25.29(a)(2), unless the bank or savings association opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22.

      (ii)  If a small bank or savings association opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22, the following applies:

      (A) The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the small bank or savings association using the same provisions used to evaluate intermediate banks or savings associations pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22.

      (B) The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the small bank or savings association for the evaluation period preceding the bank's or savings association's next CRA examination pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22 and continues evaluations under this performance test for subsequent evaluation periods until the bank or savings association opts out. If a small bank or savings association opts out of the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22, the appropriate Federal banking agency reverts to evaluating the bank or savings association pursuant to the Small Bank and Savings Association Lending Test in § 25.29(a)(2), starting with the evaluation period preceding the bank's or savings association's next CRA examination.

      (iii)  A small bank or savings association may request additional consideration pursuant to § 25.29(b).

      (4) —(i)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a limited purpose bank or savings association pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks and Savings Associations in § 25.26.

      (ii)  A limited purpose bank or savings association may request additional consideration pursuant to § 25.26(b)(2).

      (5) —(i)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a military bank or savings association pursuant to the applicable performance tests described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii)  If a military bank or savings association delineates the entire United States and its territories as its sole facility-based assessment area pursuant to § 25.16(d), the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank or savings association exclusively at the institution level based on its performance in its sole facility-based assessment area.

      (6)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the performance of a bank or savings association that has an approved strategic plan pursuant to § 25.27.

      (b) —(1)  In the performance evaluation of a bank or savings association, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the loans, investments, services, and products of a bank's or savings association's  operating subsidiaries and other affiliates, as applicable, as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, so long as no other depository institution claims the loan, investment, service, or product for purposes of this part or 12 CFR part 228 or 345.

      (2)  The appropriate Federal banking agency considers the loans, investment, services, and products of a bank's or savings association's  operating subsidiaries under this part, unless an  operating subsidiary is independently subject to the CRA. The bank or savings association must collect, maintain, and report data on the loans, investments, services, and products of its  operating subsidiaries as provided in § 25.42(c).

      (3)  The appropriate Federal banking agency considers the loans, investments, services, and products of affiliates of a bank or savings association that are not  operating subsidiaries, at the bank's or savings association's option, subject to the following:

      (i) The affiliate is not independently subject to the CRA.

      (ii) The bank or savings association collects, maintains, and reports data on the loans, investments, services, or products of the affiliate as provided in § 25.42(d).

      (iv) Pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22, if a large bank or savings association opts to have the appropriate Federal banking agency consider the closed-end home mortgage loans or small business loans that are originated or purchased by any of the bank's or savings association's affiliates in any Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider, subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the closed-end home mortgage loans or small business loans originated by all of the bank's or savings association's affiliates in the nationwide area when delineating retail lending assessment areas pursuant to § 25.17(c).

      (v) Pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24, the Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks and Savings Associations in § 25.26, the Intermediate Bank and Savings Association Community Development Test in § 25.30(a)(2), or pursuant to an approved strategic plan in § 25.27, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider, at the bank's or savings association's option, community development loans or community development investments that are originated, purchased, refinanced, or renewed by one or more of the bank's or savings association's affiliates, subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (c)  If a bank or savings association invests in or participates in a consortium that originates, purchases, refinances, or renews community development loans or community development investments, or if a bank or savings association invests in a third party that originates, purchases, refinances, or renews community development loans or community development investments, the appropriate Federal banking agency may consider, at the bank's or savings association's option, either those loans or investments, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, or the investment in the consortium or third party.

      (1) The bank or savings association must collect, maintain, and report the data pertaining to the community development loans and community development investments as provided in § 25.42(e), as applicable;

      (2) If the participants or investors choose to allocate community development loans or community development investments among themselves for consideration under this section, no participant or investor may claim a loan origination, loan purchase, or investment for community development consideration if another participant or investor claims the same loan origination, loan purchase, or investment; and

      (3) The bank or savings association may not claim community development loans or community development investments accounting for more than its percentage share (based on the level of its participation or investment) of the total loans or investments made by the consortium or third party.

      (d)  When applying performance tests and strategic plans pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and when determining whether to approve a strategic plan pursuant to § 25.27(h), the appropriate Federal banking agency may consider the following performance context information to the extent that it is not considered as part of the performance tests as provided in paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) Any information regarding a bank's or savings association's institutional capacity or constraints, including the size and financial condition of the bank or savings association, safety and soundness limitations, or any other bank-specific factors that significantly affect the bank's or savings association's ability to provide retail lending, retail banking services and retail banking products, community development loans, community development investments, or community development services;

      (2) Any information regarding the bank's or savings association's past performance;

      (3) Demographic data on income levels and income distribution, nature of housing stock, housing costs, economic climate, or other relevant data;

      (4) Any information about retail banking and community development needs and opportunities provided by the bank or savings association or other relevant sources, including, but not limited to, members of the community, community organizations, State, local, and tribal governments, and economic development agencies;

      (5) Data and information provided by the bank or savings association regarding the bank's or savings association's business strategy and product offerings;

      (6) The bank's or savings association's public file, as provided in § 25.43, including any written comments about the bank's or savings association's CRA performance submitted to the bank or savings association or the appropriate Federal banking agency and the bank's or savings association's responses to those comments; and

      (7) Any other information deemed relevant by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

      (e) —(1)  The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns conclusions to a large bank's or savings association's or limited purpose bank's or savings association's performance on the applicable tests described in paragraph (a) of this section pursuant to § 25.28 and appendix C to this part. The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns conclusions to a small bank's or savings association's or intermediate bank's or savings association's performance on the applicable tests described in paragraph (a) of this section pursuant to § 25.28 and appendices C and E to this part. The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns conclusions to a bank or savings association that has an approved strategic plan pursuant to § 25.28 and paragraph g of appendix C to this part.

      § 25.22   Retail lending test.

#### § § 25.22

      (a) —(1)  Pursuant to § 25.21, the _Retail Lending Test_ evaluates a bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community through the bank's or savings association's origination and purchase of home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans.

      (2)  The Retail Lending Test evaluates a bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community through the bank's or savings association's origination and purchase of automobile loans if the bank or savings association is a majority automobile lender. A bank or savings association that is not a majority automobile lender may opt to have automobile loans evaluated under this section.

      (b) —(1)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates whether a bank or savings association meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in each facility-based assessment area pursuant to the Retail Lending Volume Screen as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the geographic and borrower distributions of each of a bank's or savings association's major product lines in each Retail Lending Test Area, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

      (3)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section for each Retail Lending Test Area.

      (4)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency's determination of a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test conclusion for a Retail Lending Test Area is informed by the bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for the Retail Lending Test Area, performance context factors provided in § 25.21(d), and the additional factors provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (5) —(i)  If a bank or savings association has no major product line in a facility-based assessment area, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns the bank or savings association a Retail Lending Test conclusion for that facility-based assessment area based upon its performance on the Retail Lending Volume Screen pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, performance context factors provided in § 25.21(d), and the additional factors provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (ii)  The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a Retail Lending Test conclusion for a facility-based assessment area in which a bank or savings association lacks an acceptable basis for not meeting the Retail Lending Volume Threshold as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

      (c) —(1)  A bank or savings association meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area if the bank or savings association has a Bank Volume Metric of 30 percent or greater of the Market Volume Benchmark for that facility-based assessment area. The appropriate Federal banking agency calculates the Bank Volume Metric and the Market Volume Benchmark pursuant to section I of appendix A to this part.

      (2)  If a bank or savings association meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for the facility-based assessment area pursuant to paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.

      (3) —(i)  If a bank or savings association does not meet the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency determines whether the bank or savings association has an acceptable basis for not meeting the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in the facility-based assessment area by considering:

      (A) The bank's or savings association's dollar volume of non-automobile consumer loans;

      (B) The bank's or savings association's institutional capacity and constraints, including the financial condition of the bank or savings association;

      (C) The presence or lack of other lenders in the facility-based assessment area;

      (D) Safety and soundness limitations;

      (E) The bank's or savings association's business strategy; and

      (F) Any other factors that limit the bank's or savings association's ability to lend in the facility-based assessment area.

      (ii)  If, after reviewing the factors described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that a bank or savings association has an acceptable basis for not meeting the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for the facility-based assessment area in the same manner as for a bank or savings association that meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (iii) —(A)  If, after reviewing the factors in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that a large bank or savings association lacks an acceptable basis for not meeting the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns the bank or savings association a Retail Lending Test conclusion of “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance” for that facility-based assessment area. In determining whether “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance” is the appropriate conclusion, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers:

      () The bank's or savings association's retail lending volume and the extent by which it did not meet the Retail Lending Volume Threshold;

      () The bank's or savings association's distribution analysis pursuant to paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section;

      () Performance context factors provided in § 25.21(d); and

      () Additional factors provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (B)  If, after reviewing the factors in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that an intermediate bank or savings association, or a small bank or savings association that opts to be evaluated under the Retail Lending Test, lacks an acceptable basis for not meeting the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for the facility-based assessment area pursuant to paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. The appropriate Federal banking agency's determination of a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test conclusion for the facility-based assessment area is informed by:

      () The bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for the facility-based assessment area;

      () The bank's or savings association's retail lending volume and the extent by which it did not meet the Retail Lending Volume Threshold;

      () Performance context factors provided in § 25.21(d); and

      () Additional factors provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (d) —(1)  In each applicable Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates originated and purchased loans in each of the following product lines that is a major product line, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section:

      (i) Closed-end home mortgage loans in a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas and, as applicable, retail lending assessment areas and outside retail lending area;

      (ii) Small business loans in a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas and, as applicable, retail lending assessment areas and outside retail lending area;

      (iii) Small farm loans in a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas and, as applicable, outside retail lending area; and

      (iv) Automobile loans in a bank's or savings association's facility-based assessment areas and, as applicable, outside retail lending area.

      (2) —(i)  In a facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area, a product line is a major product line if the bank's or savings association's loans in that product line comprise 15 percent or more of the bank's or savings association's loans across all of the bank's or savings association's product lines in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area, as determined pursuant to paragraph II.b.1 of appendix A to this part.

      (ii)  In a retail lending assessment area:

      (A) Closed-end home mortgage loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank or savings association delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its closed-end home mortgage loans as determined by the standard in § 25.17(c)(1); and

      (B) Small business loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank or savings association delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its small business loans as determined by the standard in § 25.17(c)(2).

      (e)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test performance in each of its Retail Lending Test Areas by considering the geographic and borrower distributions of a bank's or savings association's loans in its major product lines.

      (1) —(i)  For closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans, respectively, the appropriate Federal banking agency compares a bank's or savings association's geographic and borrower distributions to performance ranges based on the applicable market and community benchmarks, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section and section V of appendix A to this part.

      (ii)  For automobile loans, the appropriate Federal banking agency compares a bank's or savings association's geographic and borrower distributions to the applicable community benchmarks, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section and section VI of appendix A to this part.

      (2) —(i)  For each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the geographic distributions separately for the following categories of census tracts:

      (A) Low-income census tracts; and

      (B) Moderate-income census tracts.

      (ii)  For each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the borrower distributions separately for, as applicable, the following categories of borrowers:

      (A) Low-income borrowers;

      (B) Moderate-income borrowers;

      (C) Businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less;

      (D) Businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million;

      (E) Farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less; and

      (F) Farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.

      (3)  To evaluate the geographic distributions in a Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the following measures:

      (i)  For each major product line, a Geographic Bank Metric, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.a of appendix A to this part;

      (ii)  For each major product line except automobile loans, a Geographic Market Benchmark, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.b of appendix A to this part for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas, and paragraph III.d of appendix A to this part for outside retail lending areas; and

      (iii)  For each major product line, a Geographic Community Benchmark, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.c of appendix A to this part for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas, and paragraph III.e of appendix A to this part for outside retail lending areas.

      (4)  To evaluate the borrower distributions in a Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the following measures:

      (i)  For each major product line, a Borrower Bank Metric, calculated pursuant to paragraph IV.a of appendix A to this part;

      (ii)  For each major product line except automobile loans, a Borrower Market Benchmark, calculated pursuant to paragraph IV.b of appendix A to this part for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas, and paragraph IV.d of appendix A to this part for outside retail lending areas; and

      (iii)  For each major product line, a Borrower Community Benchmark, calculated pursuant to paragraph IV.c of appendix A to this part for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas, and paragraph IV.e of appendix A to this part for outside retail lending areas.

      (f) —(1)  Except as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for each of a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test Areas based on the distribution analysis described in paragraph (e) of this section and using performance ranges, supporting conclusions, and product line scores as provided in sections V through VII of appendix A to this part. For each major product line, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops a separate supporting conclusion for each category of census tracts and each category of borrowers described in paragraphs V.a and VI.a of appendix A to this part.

      (2) —(i)  To develop supporting conclusions for geographic distributions of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's performance by comparing the Geographic Bank Metric to performance ranges, based on the Geographic Market Benchmark, the Geographic Community Benchmark, and multipliers, as described in paragraphs V.b and V.c of appendix A to this part.

      (ii)  To develop supporting conclusions for geographic distributions for automobile loans, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's performance by comparing the Geographic Bank Metric to the Geographic Community Benchmark, as described in paragraph VI.b of appendix A to this part.

      (3) —(i)  To develop supporting conclusions for borrower distributions of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's performance by comparing the Borrower Bank Metric to performance ranges, based on the Borrower Market Benchmark, Borrower Community Benchmark, and multipliers, as described in paragraphs V.d and V.e of appendix A to this part.

      (ii)  To develop supporting conclusions for borrower distributions for automobile loans, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's performance by comparing the Borrower Bank Metric to the Borrower Community Benchmark, as described in paragraph VI.c of appendix A to this part.

      (4) —(i)  For each supporting conclusion developed pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a corresponding performance score as described in sections V and VI of appendix A to this part.

      (ii)  As described in section VII of appendix A to this part, for each Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency:

      (A) Combines the performance scores for each supporting conclusion for each major product line into a product line score; and

      (B) Calculates a weighted average of product line scores across all major product lines.

      (iii)  For each Retail Lending Test Area, the appropriate Federal banking agency develops the Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion that corresponds to the weighted average of product line scores developed pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, as described in section VII of appendix A to this part.

      (g)  The factors in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section, as appropriate, inform the appropriate Federal banking agency's determination of a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test conclusion for a Retail Lending Test Area:

      (1) Information indicating that a bank or savings association purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, or automobile loans for the sole or primary purpose of inappropriately enhancing its retail lending performance, including, but not limited to, information indicating subsequent resale of such loans or any indication that such loans have been considered in multiple depository institutions' CRA evaluations, in which case the appropriate Federal banking agency does not consider such loans in the bank's or savings association's performance evaluation;

      (2) The dispersion of a bank's or savings association's closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, or automobile lending within a facility-based assessment area to determine whether there are gaps in lending that are not explained by performance context;

      (3) The number of lenders whose home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans and deposits data are used to establish the applicable Retail Lending Volume Threshold, geographic distribution market benchmarks, and borrower distribution market benchmarks;

      (4) Missing or faulty data that would be necessary to calculate the relevant metrics and benchmarks or any other factors that prevent the appropriate Federal banking agency from calculating a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion. If unable to calculate a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a Retail Lending Test conclusion based on consideration of the relevant available data;

      (5) Whether the Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion does not accurately reflect the bank's or savings association's performance in a Retail Lending Test Area in which one or more of the bank's or savings association's major product lines consists of fewer than 30 loans;

      (6) A bank's or savings association's closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, or automobile lending in distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income census tracts where a bank's or savings association's nonmetropolitan facility-based assessment area or nonmetropolitan retail lending assessment area includes very few or no low- and moderate-income census tracts; and

      (7) Information indicating that the credit needs of the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area are not being met by lenders in the aggregate, such that the relevant benchmarks do not adequately reflect community credit needs.

      (h) —(1) —(i)  Pursuant to § 25.28, section VIII of appendix A to this part, and appendix C to this part, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns conclusions for a bank's or savings association's Retail Lending Test performance in each Retail Lending Test Area, State, and multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution.

      (ii)  The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a Retail Lending Test conclusion for each Retail Lending Test Area based on the Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion, performance context factors provided in § 25.21(d), and the additional factors provided in paragraph (g) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section:

      (2) A review of the impact and responsiveness of the limited purpose bank's or savings association's community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area, as provided in § 25.15.

      (e)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a limited purpose bank's or savings association's community development financing performance in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to §§ 25.19 and 25.28(c), and assigns a conclusion for the bank's or savings association's performance in the State or multistate MSA based on the appropriate Federal banking agency's consideration of the following two components:

      (1)  A limited purpose bank's or savings association's community development financing performance in its facility-based assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA; and

      (2)  The dollar volume of the limited purpose bank's or savings association's community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State or multistate MSA and a review of the impact and responsiveness of those loans and investments, as provided in § 25.15.

      (f)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a limited purpose bank's or savings association's community development financing performance in the nationwide area, pursuant to § 25.19, and assigns a conclusion for the institution based on the appropriate Federal banking agency's consideration of the following two components:

      (iii)  For a limited purpose bank or savings association that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric measures the dollar volume of the bank's or savings association's community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area, excluding mortgage-backed securities, compared to the bank's or savings association's assets, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.d of appendix B to this part.

      (iv)  (A) For a limited purpose bank or savings association that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the appropriate Federal banking agency compares the Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric to the _Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark._ This comparison may only contribute positively to the bank's or savings association's Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks and Savings Associations conclusion for the institution.

      (B) The Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark measures the dollar volume of community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area, excluding mortgage-backed securities, of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, compared to assets for those depository institutions, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.e of appendix B to this part.

      (2) The plan is in effect; and

      (3) The bank or savings association has been operating under an approved plan for at least one year.

      (b)  The appropriate Federal banking agency's approval of a plan does not affect the bank's or savings association's obligation, if any, to collect, maintain, and report data as required by § 25.42.

      (c) —(1)  A plan may have a term of not more than five years.

      (2)  (i) A bank's or savings association's plan must include the same performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan, except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

      (ii) Consistent with paragraph (g) of this section, a bank's or savings association's plan may include optional evaluation components or eligible modifications and additions to the performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan.

      (3) —(i)  A bank or savings association may prepare a single plan or separate plans for its facility-based assessment areas, retail lending assessment areas, outside retail lending area, or other geographic areas that would be evaluated in the absence of an approved plan.

      (ii)  Any facility-based assessment area, retail lending assessment area, outside retail lending area, or other geographic area that would be evaluated in the absence of an approved plan, but is not included in an approved plan, will be evaluated pursuant to the performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan.

      (4) —(i)  The loans, investments, services, and products of a bank's or savings association's  operating subsidiary must be included in the bank's or savings association's plan, unless the  operating subsidiary is independently subject to CRA requirements.

      (ii) —(A)  Consistent with § 25.21(b)(3), a bank or savings association may include loans, investments, services, and products of affiliates of a bank or savings association that are not  operating subsidiaries in a plan, if those loans, investments, services, and products are not included in the CRA performance evaluation of any other depository institution.

      (B)  Affiliated depository institutions supervised by the same Federal financial supervisory agency may prepare a joint plan, provided that the plan includes, for each bank or savings association, the applicable performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan. The joint plan may include optional evaluation components or eligible modifications and additions to the performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan.

      (C)  The inclusion of an affiliate's loans, investments, services, and products in a bank's or savings association's plan, or in a joint plan of affiliated depository institutions, is subject to the following:

      () The loans, investments, services, and products may not be included in the CRA performance evaluation of another depository institution; and

      () The allocation of loans, investments, services, and products to a bank or savings association, or among affiliated banks or savings associations, must reflect a reasonable basis for the allocation and may not be for the sole or primary purpose of inappropriately enhancing any bank's or savings association's CRA evaluation.

      (d) —(1)  A bank's or savings association's plan must provide a justification that demonstrates the need for the following aspects of a plan due to the bank's or savings association's business model ( its retail banking services and retail banking products):

      (i) Why the bank's or savings association's business model is outside the scope of, or inconsistent with, one or more aspects of the performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan;

      (ii) Why an evaluation of the bank or savings association pursuant to any aspect of a plan in paragraph (d)(1) of this section would more meaningfully reflect a bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community than if it were evaluated under the performance tests that would apply in the absence of an approved plan; and

      (iii) Why the optional performance components and eligible modifications or additions meet the standards of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable.

      (e) —(1)  Before submitting a draft plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency for approval pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, a bank or savings association must:

      () A bank or savings association may add annual measurable goals for any aspect of the bank's or savings association's retail lending.

      (B) For a bank or savings association the appropriate Federal banking agency would otherwise evaluate pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22:

      () A bank or savings association may add additional loan products, such as non-automobile consumer loans or open-end home mortgage loans, or additional goals for major product lines, such as closed-end home mortgage loans to first-time homebuyers, with accompanying annual measurable goals.

      () Where annual measurable goals for additional loan products or additional goals for major product lines have been added pursuant to paragraph (g)(_2_)(i)(B)() of this section, a bank or savings association may provide different weights for averaging together the performance across these loan products and may include those loan products in the numerator of the Bank Volume Metric.

      (B) A bank or savings association other than a large bank or savings association may include a community development services component and accompanying annual measurable goals in its plan.

      (v)  A bank or savings association may specify alternative weights for averaging test performance across assessment areas or other geographic areas.

      (3)  (i) A bank or savings association may incorporate performance evaluation components and accompanying annual measurable goals for additional geographic areas but may not eliminate the evaluation of its performance in any geographic area that would be included in its performance evaluation in the absence of an approved plan.

      (ii) If a large bank or savings association is no longer required to delineate a retail lending assessment area previously identified in the plan as a result of not meeting the required retail lending assessment area thresholds pursuant to § 25.17, the appropriate Federal banking agency will not evaluate the bank or savings association for its performance in that area for the applicable years of the plan in which the area is no longer a retail lending assessment area.

      (iii) A bank or savings association that includes additional performance evaluation components with accompanying annual measurable goals in its plan must specify the geographic areas where those components and goals apply.

      (4)  A bank or savings association may submit additional information to the appropriate Federal banking agency on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan must be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the appropriate Federal banking agency to judge the merits of the plan.

      (5)  A bank or savings association that includes modified or additional performance evaluation components with accompanying annual measurable goals in its plan must specify in its plan annual measurable goals that constitute “Satisfactory” performance and may specify annual measurable goals that constitute “Outstanding” performance.

      (2)  If a bank or savings association established annual measurable goals and does not meet one or more of its satisfactory goals, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider the following factors to determine the effect on a bank's or savings association's CRA performance evaluation:

      (i) The degree to which the goal was not met;

      (ii) The importance of the unmet goals to the plan as a whole; and

      (iii) Any circumstances beyond the control of the bank or savings association, such as economic conditions or other market factors or events, that have adversely impacted the bank's or savings association's ability to perform.

      (b) —(1)  The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a rating for a bank's or savings association's overall CRA performance of “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance” in each State and multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, and for the institution, as provided in this section and appendices D and E to this part. The ratings assigned by the appropriate Federal banking agency reflect the bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank or savings association.

      (2)  (i) For large banks or savings associations, intermediate banks or savings associations, small banks or savings associations that opt into the Retail Lending Test in § 25.22, and limited purpose banks or savings associations, the appropriate Federal banking agency calculates and discloses the bank's or savings association's overall performance score for each State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution. The appropriate Federal banking agency uses a bank's or savings association's overall performance scores described in this section to assign a rating for the bank's or savings association's overall performance in each State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

      (ii) Overall performance scores are based on the bank's or savings association's performance score for each applicable performance test and derived as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as applicable, and appendix D to this part.

      (3)  In calculating a large bank's or savings association's or intermediate bank's or savings association's overall performance score for each State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and the institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency weights the performance scores for the bank or savings association for each applicable performance test as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i)  The appropriate Federal banking agency weights the bank's or savings association's performance score for the performance tests applicable to a large bank or savings association as follows:

      (A) Retail Lending Test, 40 percent;

      (B) Retail Services and Products Test, 10 percent;

      (C) Community Development Financing Test, 40 percent; and

      (D) Community Development Services Test, 10 percent.

      (ii)  The appropriate Federal banking agency weights the bank's or savings association's performance score for the performance tests applicable to an intermediate bank or savings association as follows:

      (A) Retail Lending Test, 50 percent; and

      (B) Intermediate Bank and Savings Association Community Development Test or Community Development Financing Test, as applicable, 50 percent.

      (4) —(i)  An intermediate bank or savings association or a large bank or savings association must receive at least a “Low Satisfactory” Retail Lending Test conclusion for the State, multistate MSA, or institution to receive, respectively, a State, multistate MSA, or institution rating of “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding.”

      (ii)  (A) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A), the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a large bank or savings association an overall conclusion for each facility-based assessment area and, as applicable, each retail lending assessment area, as provided in paragraph g.2.ii of appendix D to this part.

      (B) Except as provided in § 25.51(e), a large bank or savings association with a combined total of 10 or more facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas in any State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or for the institution may not receive a rating of “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding” in that State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or for the institution, unless the bank or savings association receives an overall conclusion of at least “Low Satisfactory” in 60 percent or more of the total number of its facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas in that State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or for the institution.

      (c) —(1) —(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank or savings association and assigns conclusions and ratings for any State in which the bank or savings association maintains a main office, branch, or deposit-taking remote service facility.

      (ii)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank or savings association and assigns conclusions and ratings for a State only if the bank or savings association maintains a main office, branch, or deposit-taking remote service facility outside the portion of the State comprising any multistate MSA identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In evaluating a bank or savings association and assigning conclusions and ratings for a State, the appropriate Federal banking agency does not consider activities to be in the State if those activities take place in the portion of the State comprising any multistate MSA identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (iii)  If a facility-based assessment area of a bank or savings association comprises a geographic area spanning two or more States within a multistate MSA that is not identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers activities in the entire facility-based assessment area to be in the State in which the bank or savings association maintains, within the multistate MSA, a main office, branch, or deposit-taking remote service facility. In evaluating a bank or savings association and assigning conclusions and ratings for a State, the appropriate Federal banking agency does not consider activities to be in the State if those activities take place in any facility-based assessment area that is considered to be in another State pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1)(iii).

      (iv)  In assigning Retail Lending Test conclusions for a State pursuant to § 25.22(h), the appropriate Federal banking agency does not consider a bank's or savings association's activities to be in the State if those activities take place in a retail lending assessment area consisting of counties in more than one State.

      (2)  The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank or savings association and assigns conclusions and ratings under this part in any multistate MSA in which the bank or savings association maintains a main office, a branch, or a deposit-taking remote service facility in two or more States within that multistate MSA.

      (d) —(1)  For each State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and the institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency's evaluation of a bank's or savings association's performance under this part is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The appropriate Federal banking agency considers evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices described in this section by:

      (i) The bank or savings association, including by an  operating subsidiary of the bank or savings association; or

      (ii) Any other affiliate related to any activities considered in the evaluation of the bank or savings association.

      (2)  For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, discriminatory or other illegal credit practices consist of the following:

      (i) Discrimination on a prohibited basis, including in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 ) or the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 );

      (ii) Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1639);

      (iii) Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45);

      (iv) Violations of section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536);

      (v) Violations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 );

      (vi) Violations of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 );

      (vii) Violations of the Military Lending Act (10 U.S.C. 987);

      (viii) Violations of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 3901 ); and

      (ix) Any other violation of a law, rule, or regulation consistent with the types of violations in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section, as determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

      (3)  In determining the effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the bank's or savings association's assigned State, multistate MSA, and institution ratings, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider:

      (i) The root cause or causes of any such violations of law, rule, or regulation;

      (ii) The severity of any harm to any communities, individuals, small businesses, and small farms resulting from such violations;

      (iii) The duration of time over which the violations occurred;

      (iv) The pervasiveness of the violations;

      (v) The degree to which the bank or savings association,  operating subsidiary, or affiliate, as applicable, has established an effective compliance management system across the institution to self-identify risks and to take the necessary actions to reduce the risk of noncompliance and harm to communities, individuals, small businesses, and small farms; and

      (vi) Any other relevant information.

      (e)  When assigning ratings, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers a bank's or savings association's past performance. If a bank's or savings association's prior rating was “Needs to Improve,” the appropriate Federal banking agency may determine that a “Substantial Noncompliance” rating is appropriate where the bank or savings association failed to improve its performance since the previous evaluation period, with no acceptable basis for such failure.

      (3)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, a small bank or savings association may request and receive additional consideration at the institution level for activities with MDIs, WDIs, and LICUs pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2903(b) and 2907(a) and for providing low-cost education loans to low-income borrowers pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2903(d), regardless of the small bank's or savings association's overall institution rating.

      (1) May order that a bank's or savings association's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank or savings association provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the OCC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank or savings association has an acceptable plan under which the bank or savings association will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank or savings association in the host state; and

      (b)  Before exercising the OCC's authority to order the bank or savings association to close a covered interstate branch, the OCC will issue to the bank or savings association a notice of the OCC's intent to order the closure and will schedule a hearing within 60 days of issuing the notice.

    (a)  This part is issued under the provisions of the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 U.S.C. 3201 ), as amended, and the OCC's general rulemaking authority for national banks in 12 U.S.C. 93a and Federal savings associations in 12 U.S.C. 1462a and 5412(b)(2)(B).

    (b)  The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect.

    (c)  This part applies to management officials of national banks, Federal savings associations, and their affiliates.

In making this determination, the OCC considers, among other things, whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family, whose shares are necessary to constitute the group, owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.

    (b)  means:

    (d)  means cities, towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points.

    (h)  means a depository institution or a depository holding company.

    (i)  means census tracts (or, if an area is not in a census tract, block numbering areas delineated by the United States Bureau of the Census) where the median family income is less than 100 percent of the area median income.

    (i) A director;

    (n)  means a natural person who serves as a management official and has an obligation to act on behalf of another person with respect to management responsibilities. The OCC will find that a person has an obligation to act on behalf of another person only if the first person has an agreement, express or implied, to act on behalf of the second person with respect to management responsibilities. The OCC will determine, after giving the affected persons an opportunity to respond, whether a person is a

    (b)  A management official of a depository organization may not serve at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated depository organization if the depository organizations in question (or a depository institution affiliate thereof) have offices in the same RMSA and each depository organization has total assets of $50 million or more.

The OCC will adjust these thresholds, as necessary, based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for the Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, not seasonally adjusted, with rounding to the nearest $100 million. The OCC will announce the revised thresholds by publishing a final rule without notice and comment in the

    (iii) The notificant failed to furnish all the information required by the OCC.

    (i) Any savings association that has issued stock in connection with a qualified stock issuance pursuant to section 10(q) of the HOLA, as provided by section 205(9) of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3204(9)).

#### § § 26.6

    (a)  The OCC may by order issued following receipt of an application, exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in § 26.3 if the OCC finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition and would not present safety and soundness concerns.

    (b)  In reviewing an application for an exemption under this section, the OCC will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if the depository organization seeking to add a management official:

    (1) Primarily serves low-and moderate-income areas;

    (2) Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a minority group, or women;

    (3) Is a depository institution that has been chartered for less than two years; or

    (ii) An unsafe or unsound condition.

    (2) If the OCC grants an interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless otherwise provided by the OCC in writing.

    § 26.7   Change in circumstances.

#### § § 26.7

    (a)  A management official shall terminate his or her service or apply for an exemption if a change in circumstances causes the service to become prohibited. A change in circumstances may include an increase in asset size of an organization, a change in the delineation of the RMSA or community, the establishment of an office, an increase in the aggregate deposits of the depository organization, or an acquisition, merger, consolidation, or any reorganization of the ownership structure of a depository organization that causes a previously permissible interlock to become prohibited.

    (b)  A management official described in paragraph (a) of this section may continue to serve the depository organization involved in the interlock for 15 months following the date of the change in circumstances. The OCC may shorten this period under appropriate circumstances.

    § 26.8   Enforcement.

#### § § 26.8

    Except as provided in this section, the OCC administers and enforces the Interlocks Act with respect to national banks, Federal savings associations, and their affiliates, and may refer any case of a prohibited interlocking relationship involving these entities to the Attorney General of the United States to enforce compliance with the Interlocks Act and this part. If an affiliate of a national bank or Federal savings association is subject to the primary regulation of another Federal depository organization supervisory agency, then the OCC does not administer and enforce the Interlocks Act with respect to that affiliate.

#### § § 27.2

    For the purpose of this part, including all forms and instructions issued for use under this part:

    (a)  means a natural person, including a co-applicant, who makes an application.

    (b)  means an oral in-person or written request for an extension of credit for a home loan that is made in accordance with procedures established by a bank for the type of credit requested.

    (c)  means a national bank and any subsidiaries of a national bank.

    (d)  means an application in connection with which a bank has received all the information that it regularly obtains and considers in evaluating the amount and type of credit requested.

    (e)  means the place where home loan applications are accepted or rejected.

    (f)  means a real estate loan for the purchase, permanent financing for construction, or the refinancing of residential real property which the applicant intends to occupy as a principal residence.

    (h)  means a written or an oral in-person request for information about the terms of a home loan by a natural person on his/her own behalf which is received on a bank's premises by any person at the bank who customarily receives or is authorized to receive such requests. Telephonic communications do not constitute an inquiry for purposes of this part.

    (i)  means any loan secured by real estate where the bank relies upon such real estate as the primary security for the loan. Where the bank in its judgment relies substantially upon other factors, such as the general credit standing of the borrower, guaranties, or security other than real estate, the loan does not constitute a real estate loan, although as a matter of prudent banking practice it may also be secured by real estate.

    (1) A loan made in reliance upon the security of a mobile home will not be considered a real estate loan, although as a prudent banking practice the security interest is recorded or otherwise perfected as if the mobile home were real estate. For purposes of this part, a loan made in reliance upon the security of a mobile home and the parcel of land to which it is permanently affixed will be considered a real estate loan.

    (2) Where the bank relies substantially on the insurance guaranty of a governmental agency in making a loan, it does not constitute a real estate loan except for the purposes of § 27.4 of this part (Inquiry/Application Log).

    (j)  means improved real property (not vacant land) used or intended to be used for residential purposes, including single family homes, dwellings for from two to four families, and individual units of condominiums and cooperatives.

A bank required to maintain information under § 27.3(a)(2) shall submit the information to the Comptroller on the form prescribed in appendix I of this part. A bank which is exempt from maintaining the information required under § 27.3(a) shall notify the Comptroller of this fact in writing within 30 calendar days of its receipt of the Comptroller's request.

      § 28.12   Approval of a Federal branch or agency.

#### § § 28.12

      (a) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a foreign bank shall submit an application to, and obtain prior approval from, the OCC before it:

      (i) Establishes a Federal branch or agency; or

      (ii) Exercises fiduciary powers at a Federal branch.

      (2)  A foreign bank must receive a license from the OCC to open and operate its initial Federal branch or agency in the United States. A foreign bank that has a license to operate and is operating a full-service Federal branch need not obtain a new license for any additional Federal branches or agencies, or to upgrade or downgrade its operations in an existing Federal branch or agency. A foreign bank that only has a license to operate and is operating a limited Federal branch or Federal agency need not obtain a new license for any additional limited Federal branches or Federal agencies, or to convert a limited Federal branch into a Federal agency or a Federal agency into a limited Federal branch.

      (b)  Generally, in reviewing an application by a foreign bank to establish a Federal branch or agency, the OCC considers:

      (1) The financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the applicant foreign bank and the Federal branch or agency;

      (2) Whether the foreign bank has furnished to the OCC the information the OCC requires to assess the application adequately, and provided the OCC with adequate assurances that information will be made available to the OCC on the operations or activities of the foreign bank or any of its affiliates that the OCC deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA and other applicable Federal banking statutes;

      (3) Whether the foreign bank and its United States affiliates are in compliance with applicable United States law;

      (4) The convenience and needs of the community to be served and the effects of the proposal on competition in the domestic and foreign commerce of the United States;

      (5) With respect to an application to establish a Federal branch or agency outside of the foreign bank's home state, whether the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor. The OCC, in its discretion, also may consider whether the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor when reviewing any other type of application to establish a Federal branch or agency; and

      (6) Whether the home country supervisor has consented to the proposed establishment of the Federal branch or agency.

      (c)  In determining whether a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis, the OCC reviews various factors, including whether the foreign bank is supervised or regulated in a manner so that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank to assess the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with laws and regulations as specified in the FRB's Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.24.

      (d)  The OCC may impose conditions on its approval including a condition permitting future termination of activities based on the inability of the foreign bank to provide information on its activities, or those of its affiliate, that the OCC deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with United States banking laws.

      (e)  Unless the OCC concludes that the filing presents significant supervisory or compliance concerns, or raises significant legal or policy issues, the OCC generally processes the following filings by an eligible foreign bank, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, under expedited review procedures:

      (1)  An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to relocate a Federal branch or agency within a state is deemed approved by the OCC as of the seventh day after the close of the applicable public comment period in 12 CFR part 5, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.

      (2)  (i) In a case where a foreign bank seeks to establish intrastate an additional Federal branch or agency, the foreign bank shall provide written notice 30 days in advance of the establishment of the intrastate Federal branch or agency.

      (ii) The OCC may waive the 30-day period required under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section if immediate action is required. The OCC also may suspend the notice period or require an application if the notification raises significant policy or supervisory concerns.

      (3)  An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to establish and operate a de novo Federal branch or agency in any state outside the home state of the foreign bank is deemed conditionally approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the applicable public comment period, or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, whichever is later, unless the OCC notifies the foreign bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review. In the event that the FRB has approved the application prior to the expiration of the period, then the OCC's approval shall be deemed a final approval.

      (4)  An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to establish a Federal branch or agency as defined in 12 CFR 28.11(f)(4) or (f)(6) is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the OCC receives the filing, unless the OCC notifies the foreign bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.

      (5)  An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to exercise fiduciary powers at an established Federal branch is deemed approved by the OCC 30 days after filing with the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.

      (6)  Any other application submitted by an eligible foreign bank may be approved by the OCC on an expedited basis as described in the Manual.

      (f)  For purposes of this section, a foreign bank is an eligible foreign bank if each Federal branch and agency of the foreign bank or, if the foreign bank has no Federal branches or agencies and is engaging in an establishment of a Federal branch or agency as defined in 12 CFR 28.11(f)(4), each state branch and agency:

      (1) Has a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the interagency rating system for United States branches and agencies of foreign banks;

      (2) Is not subject to a cease and desist order, consent order, formal written agreement, Prompt Corrective Action directive ( 12 CFR part 6) or, if subject to such order, agreement, or directive, is informed in writing by the OCC that the Federal branch or agency may be treated as an “eligible foreign bank” for purposes of this section; and

      (3) Has, if applicable, a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), 12 U.S.C. 2906, rating of “Outstanding” or “Satisfactory”.

      (g)  Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank proposing to establish a Federal branch or agency through the acquisition of, or merger or consolidation with, a foreign bank that has an office in the United States, may proceed with the transaction before an application to establish the Federal branch or agency has been filed or acted upon, if the applicant:

      (1) Gives the OCC reasonable advance notice of the proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation;

      (2) Prior to consummation of the acquisition, merger, or consolidation, commits in writing to comply with the OCC application procedures within a reasonable period of time, or has already submitted an application; and

      (3) Commits in writing to abide by the OCC's decision on the application, including a decision to terminate activities of the Federal branch or agency.

      (h)  Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank proposing to establish a Federal branch or agency through the acquisition of, or merger or consolidation with, a foreign bank that has an existing U.S. bank subsidiary or a Federal or state branch or agency may proceed with the transaction and provide after-the-fact notice to the OCC within 14 days of the transaction, if:

      (1) The resulting bank is an “eligible foreign bank” under paragraph (f) of this section; and

      (2) No Federal branch established by the transaction accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 ).

      (i)  A foreign bank shall provide written notice to the OCC within 10 days after converting a Federal branch into a limited Federal branch or Federal agency.

      (j)  A foreign bank shall file an application for approval pursuant to this section in accordance with 12 CFR part 5 and the Manual. The OCC reserves the right to adopt materially different procedures for a particular filing, or class of filings, pursuant to 12 CFR 5.2(b).

      (k)  As provided in 12 CFR 5.4(c), the OCC may accept an application or other filing submitted to another U.S. Government agency that covers the proposed activity or transaction and contains substantially the same information as required by the OCC.

      § 28.13   Permissible activities.

#### § § 28.13

      (a) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided by the IBA, other Federal laws or regulations, or otherwise determined by the OCC, the operations of a foreign bank at a Federal branch or agency shall be conducted with the same rights and privileges and subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations that would apply if the Federal branch or agency were a national bank operating at the same location.

      (2)  Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, any provision in law, regulation, policy, or procedure that requires a national bank to obtain the approval of its board of directors will be deemed to require a Federal branch or agency to obtain the approval of parent foreign bank senior management.

      (b) —(1)  A Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank shall not manage, through an office of the foreign bank that is located outside the United States and that is managed or controlled by that Federal branch or agency, any type of activity that a United States bank is not permitted to manage at any branch or subsidiary of the United States bank that is located outside the United States.

      (2)  The types of activities referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section include the types of activities authorized to a United States bank by state or Federal charters, regulations issued by chartering or regulatory authorities, and other United States banking laws. However, United States procedural or quantitative requirements that may be applicable to the conduct of those activities by United States banks do not apply.

      (c)  For purposes of section 7(h) of the IBA, 12 U.S.C. 3105(h), the OCC may issue opinions, interpretations, or rulings regarding permissible activities of Federal branches.

      § 28.14   Limitations based upon capital of a foreign bank.

#### § § 28.14

      (a)  Any limitation or restriction based upon the capital of a national bank shall be deemed to refer, as applied to a Federal branch or agency, to the dollar equivalent of the capital of the foreign bank.

      (b)  Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank must calculate its capital in a manner consistent with 12 CFR part 3, subpart C, for purposes of this section.

      (c)  The foreign bank shall aggregate business transacted by all Federal branches and agencies with the business transacted by all state branches and state agencies controlled by the foreign bank in determining its compliance with limitations based upon the capital of the foreign bank. The foreign bank shall designate one Federal branch or agency office in the United States to maintain consolidated information so that the OCC can monitor compliance.

      § 28.15   Capital equivalency deposits.

#### § § 28.15

      (a) —(1)  For purposes of section 4(g) of the IBA, 12 U.S.C. 3102(g), unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank's capital equivalency deposits (CED) must consist of:

      (i) Investment securities eligible for investment by national banks;

      (ii) United States dollar deposits payable in the United States or payable in any other Group of Ten country;

      (iii) Certificates of deposit, payable in the United States, and banker's acceptances, provided that, in either case, the issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments for the projected life of the asset or exposure. An issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected;

      (iv) Repurchase agreements; or

      (v) Other similar assets permitted by the OCC to qualify to be included in the CED.

      (2)  The agreement with the depository bank to hold the CED and the amount of the deposit must comply with the requirements in section 4(g) of the IBA, 12 U.S.C. 3102(g). If a foreign bank has more than one Federal branch or agency in a state, it shall determine the CED and the amount of liabilities requiring capital equivalency coverage on an aggregate basis for all the foreign bank's Federal branches or agencies in that state.

      (3)  In determining the amount of the CED, the OCC excludes liabilities of an international banking facility (IBF) to third parties and of a Federal branch of a foreign bank to an IBF. The OCC may exclude liabilities from repurchase agreements on a case-by-case basis.

      (b)  For prudential or supervisory reasons, the OCC may require, in individual cases or otherwise, that a foreign bank increase its CED above the minimum amount. For example, the OCC may require an increase if a Federal branch or agency of the foreign bank increases its leverage through the establishment, acquisition, or maintenance of an operating subsidiary.

      (c)  The obligations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be valued at principal amount or market value, whichever is lower.

      (d)  A foreign bank should require its depository bank to segregate its CED on the depository bank's books and records. The funds deposited and obligations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section that are placed in safekeeping at a depository bank to satisfy a foreign bank's CED requirement:

      (1) May not be reduced in value below the minimum required for that branch or agency without the prior approval of the OCC, but in no event below the statutory minimum;

      (2) Must be maintained pursuant to an agreement prescribed by the OCC that shall be a written agreement entered into with the OCC for purposes of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818; and

      (3) Must be free from any lien, charge, right of setoff, credit, or preference in connection with any claim of the depository bank against the foreign bank.

      (e)(1)  As provided in 12 U.S.C. 3102(g), a foreign bank with a Federal branch or agency shall deposit its CED into an account in a bank that is located in the state in which the Federal branch or agency is located. For this purpose, such depository bank is considered to be located in those states in which it has its main office or a branch. A foreign bank with Federal branches or agencies in more than one state may consolidate some or all of its CEDs into one such account.

      (2)  The total amount of the consolidated CED shall continue to be calculated on an office-by-office basis.

      (f)  Each Federal branch or agency shall maintain a capital equivalency account and keep records of the amount of liabilities requiring capital equivalency coverage in a manner and form prescribed by the OCC.

      § 28.16   Deposit-taking by an uninsured Federal branch.

#### § § 28.16

      (a)  In carrying out this section, the OCC shall consider the importance of according foreign banks competitive opportunities equal to those of United States banks and the availability of credit to all sectors of the United States economy, including international trade finance.

      (1) Individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United States at the time of the initial deposit;

      (2) Individuals who are not citizens of the United States, but are residents of the United States, and are employed by a foreign bank, foreign business, foreign government, or recognized international organization;

      (3) Persons (including immediate family members of an individual) to whom the branch or foreign bank (including any affiliate thereof) has extended credit or provided other nondeposit banking services within the past 12 months, or with whom the branch or foreign bank has a written agreement to extend credit or provide such services within 12 months after the date of the initial deposit;

      (4) Foreign businesses and large United States businesses;

      (5) Foreign governmental units, including political subdivisions, and recognized international organizations;

      (8) Persons who may deposit funds with an Edge corporation as provided in the FRB's Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.6, including persons engaged in certain international business activities; and

      (9) Any other depositor if:

      (i) The aggregate amount of deposits received from those depositors does not exceed, on an average daily basis, 1 percent of the average of the branch's deposits for the last 30 days of the most recent calendar quarter, excluding deposits of other offices, branches, agencies, or wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank; and

      (ii) The branch does not solicit deposits from the general public by advertising, display of signs, or similar activity designed to attract the attention of the general public.

      (c)  A foreign bank may apply to the OCC for an exemption to permit an uninsured Federal branch to accept or maintain deposit accounts that are not listed in paragraph (b) of this section. The request should describe:

      (1) The types, sources, and estimated amounts of such deposits and explain why the OCC should grant an exemption; and

      (2) How the exemption maintains and furthers the policies described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(9) of this section, a foreign bank that has more than one Federal branch in the same state may aggregate deposits in all of its Federal branches in that state, but exclude deposits of other branches, agencies or wholly owned subsidiaries of the bank. The Federal branch shall compute the average amount by using the sum of deposits as of the close of business of the last 30 calendar days ending with and including the last day of the calendar quarter, divided by 30. The Federal branch shall maintain records of the calculation until its next examination by the OCC.

      (e)  A Federal branch that accepts deposits pursuant to this section shall provide notice to depositors pursuant to 12 CFR 346.207, which generally requires that the Federal branch conspicuously display a sign at the branch and include a statement on each signature card, passbook, and instrument evidencing a deposit that the deposit is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

      (f)  (1) An uninsured Federal branch may maintain a deposit lawfully accepted under the exemptions existing prior to July 1, 1996 if the deposit would qualify for an exemption under paragraph (b) of this section, except for the fact that the deposit was made before July 1, 1996.

      (2) If a deposit lawfully accepted under the exemption existing prior to July 1, 1996 would not qualify for an exemption under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the uninsured Federal branch must terminate the deposit no later than:

      (i) In the case of time deposits, the maturity of a time deposit or October 1, 1996, whichever is longer; or

      (ii) In the case of all other deposits, five years after July 1, 1996.

      (g)  For purposes of this section, the term “foreign bank” does not include any bank organized under the laws of any territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands whose deposits are insured by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811

      (b)  A foreign bank operating a Federal branch or agency in the United States shall provide the OCC with a copy of reports filed with other Federal regulatory agencies that are designated in guidance issued by the OCC.

      (c)  (1) Each Federal branch or agency shall maintain a set of accounts and records reflecting its transactions that are separate from those of the foreign bank and any other branch or agency. The Federal branch or agency shall keep a set of accounts and records in English sufficient to permit the OCC to examine the condition of the Federal branch or agency and its compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Federal branch or agency shall promptly provide any additional records requested by the OCC for examination or supervisory purposes.

      (2) A foreign bank with more than one Federal branch or agency in a state shall designate one of those offices to maintain consolidated asset, liability, and capital equivalency accounts for all Federal branches or agencies in that state.

      (3) A foreign bank with a Federal branch or agency in more than one state that consolidates its CEDs into one account in accordance with § 28.15(e) shall designate a participating Federal branch or agency to maintain consolidated asset, liability, and capital equivalency account information for all Federal branches and agencies covered by the consolidated deposit.

      § 28.52   Allocated transfer risk reserve.

#### § § 28.52

      (a)  A banking institution shall establish an allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR) for specified international assets when required by the OCC in accordance with this section.

      (b) —(1)  At least annually, the Federal banking agencies shall determine jointly, based on the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following:

      (i) Which international assets subject to transfer risk warrant establishment of an ATRR;

      (ii) The amount of the ATRR for the specified assets; and

      (iii) Whether an ATRR established for specified assets may be reduced.

      (2) —(i)  The Federal banking agencies shall apply the following criteria in determining whether an ATRR is required for particular international assets:

      (A) Whether the quality of a banking institution's assets has been impaired by a protracted inability of public or private obligors in a foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as indicated by such factors, among others, as whether:

      () Such obligors have failed to make full interest payments on external indebtedness;

      () Such obligors have failed to comply with the terms of any restructured indebtedness; or

      () A foreign country has failed to comply with any International Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or

      (B) Whether no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration of debt service.

      (ii)  (A) In determining the amount of the ATRR, the Federal banking agencies shall consider:

      () The length of time the quality of the asset has been impaired;

      () Recent actions taken to restore debt service capability;

      () Prospects for restored asset quality; and

      () Such other factors as the Federal banking agencies may consider relevant to the quality of the asset.

      (B) The initial year's provision for the ATRR shall be 10 percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the Federal banking agencies. Additional provision, if any, for the ATRR in subsequent years shall be 15 percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the Federal banking agencies.

      (3)  Based on the joint agency determinations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the OCC shall notify each banking institution holding assets subject to an ATRR:

      (i) Of the amount of the ATRR to be established by the institution for specified international assets; and

      (ii) That an ATRR to be established for specified assets may be reduced.

      (c) —(1)  A banking institution shall establish an ATRR by a charge to current income and the amounts so charged shall not be included in the banking institution's capital or surplus.

      (2)  A banking institution shall account for an ATRR separately from the Allowance for Possible Loan Losses, and shall deduct the ATRR from “gross loans and leases” to arrive at “net loans and leases.” The ATRR must be established for each asset subject to the ATRR in the percentage amount specified.

      (3)  A banking institution shall establish an ATRR, as required, on a consolidated basis. Consolidation should be in accordance with the procedures and tests of significance set forth in the instructions for preparation of  (FFIEC 031, 032, 033 and 034). For bank holding companies, the consolidation shall be in accordance with the principles set forth in the “Instructions to the Bank Holding Company Financial Supplement to Report F.R. Y-6” (Form F.R. Y-9). Edge corporations and Agreement corporations engaged in banking shall report in accordance with instructions for preparation of the Report of Condition for Edge corporations and Agreement corporations (Form F.R. 2886b).

      (4)  A banking institution need not establish an ATRR if it writes down in the period in which the ATRR is required, or has written down in prior periods, the value of the specified international assets in the requisite amount for each such asset. For purposes of this paragraph, international assets may be written down by a charge to the Allowance for Possible Loan Losses or a reduction in the principal amount of the asset by application of interest payments or other collections on the asset. However, the Allowance for Possible Loan Losses must be replenished in such amount necessary to restore it to a level which adequately provides for the estimated losses inherent in the banking institution's loan portfolio.

      (5)  A banking institution may reduce an ATRR when notified by the OCC or, at any time, by writing down such amount of the international asset for which the ATRR was established.

      § 28.53   Accounting for fees on international loans.

#### § § 28.53

      (a)  No banking institution shall charge, in connection with the restructuring of an international loan, any fee exceeding the administrative costs of the restructuring unless it amortizes the amount of the fee exceeding the administrative cost over the effective life of the loan.

      (b)  Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, a banking institution is to account for fees in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      § 28.54   Reporting and disclosure of international assets.

#### § § 28.54

      (a)  (1) Pursuant to section 907(a) of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 (title IX, Pub. L. 98-181, 97 Stat. 1153, 12 U.S.C. 3906) (ILSA) a banking institution shall submit to the OCC, at least quarterly, information regarding the amounts and composition of its holdings of international assets.

      (2) Pursuant to section 907(b) of ILSA (12 U.S.C. 3906), a banking institution shall submit to the OCC information regarding concentrations in its holdings of international assets that are material in relation to total assets and to capital of the institution, such information to be made publicly available by the OCC on request.

      (b)  The format, content, and reporting and filing dates of the reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined jointly by the Federal banking agencies. The requirements to be prescribed by the agencies may include changes to existing reporting forms (such as the Country Exposure Report, FFIEC 009) or such other requirements as the agencies deem appropriate. The agencies also may determine to exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section banking institutions that, in the agencies' judgment, have  holdings of international assets.

      (c)  Nothing contained in this part shall preclude the OCC from requiring from a banking institution such additional or more frequent information on the institution's holdings of international assets as the OCC may consider necessary.

    § 30.2   Purpose.

#### § § 30.2

    Section 39 of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, requires the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish safety and soundness standards. Pursuant to section 39, a national bank or Federal savings association may be required to submit a compliance plan if it is not in compliance with a safety and soundness standard prescribed by guideline under section 39(a) or (b). An enforceable order under section 8 of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), may be issued if, after being notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard prescribed under section 39, the national bank or Federal savings association fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan. This part establishes procedures for requiring submission of a compliance plan and issuing an enforceable order pursuant to section 39. The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness are set forth in appendix A to this part, and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards are set forth in appendix B to this part.

    § 30.3   Determination and notification of failure to meet safety and soundness standards and request for compliance plan.

#### § § 30.3

    (a)  The OCC may, based upon an examination, inspection, or any other information that becomes available to the OCC, determine that a national bank or Federal savings association has failed to satisfy the safety and soundness standards contained in the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness set forth in appendix A to this part, the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information set forth in appendix B to this part, the OCC Guidelines Establishing Standards for Residential Mortgage Lending Practices set forth in appendix C to this part, the OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches set forth in appendix D to this part, or the OCC Guidelines Establishing Standards for Recovery Planning by Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches set forth in appendix E to this part.

    (b)  If the OCC determines that a national bank or Federal savings association has failed to satisfy a safety and soundness standard pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OCC may request, by letter or through a report of examination, the submission of a compliance plan and the bank or savings association shall be deemed to have notice of the deficiency three days after mailing of the letter by the OCC or delivery of the report of examination.

    § 30.4   Filing of safety and soundness compliance plan.

#### § § 30.4

    (a) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association shall file a written safety and soundness compliance plan with the OCC within 30 days of receiving a request for a compliance plan pursuant to § 30.3(b) unless the OCC notifies the bank or savings association in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period.

    (2)  If a national bank or Federal savings association is obligated to file, or is currently operating under, a capital restoration plan submitted pursuant to section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o), a cease-and-desist order entered into pursuant to section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)), a formal or informal agreement, or a response to a report of examination or report of inspection, it may, with the permission of the OCC, submit a compliance plan under this section as part of that plan, order, agreement, or response, subject to the deadline provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b)  The compliance plan shall include a description of the steps the national bank or Federal savings association will take to correct the deficiency and the time within which those steps will be taken.

    (c)  Within 30 days after receiving a safety and soundness compliance plan under this part, the OCC shall provide written notice to the national bank or Federal savings association of whether the plan has been approved or seek additional information from the bank or savings association regarding the plan. The OCC may extend the time within which notice regarding approval of a plan will be provided.

    (d) —(1)  If a national bank or Federal savings association fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time specified by the OCC or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan, then the OCC shall, by order, require the bank or savings association to correct the deficiency and may take further actions provided in section 39(e)(2)(B). Pursuant to section 39(e)(3), the OCC may be required to take certain actions if the national bank or Federal savings association commenced operations or experienced a change in control within the previous 24-month period, or the bank or savings association experienced extraordinary growth during the previous 18-month period.

    (2)  For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, extraordinary growth means an increase in assets of more than 7.5 percent during any quarter within the 18-month period preceding the issuance of a request for submission of a compliance plan, by a national bank or Federal savings association that is not well capitalized for purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act. For purposes of calculating an increase in assets, assets acquired through merger or acquisition approved pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)) will be excluded.

    (e)  A national bank or Federal savings association that has filed an approved compliance plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the OCC, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the bank or savings association shall implement the compliance plan as previously approved.

#### § § 30.5

    (a) —(1)  The OCC shall provide a national bank or Federal savings association prior written notice of the OCC's intention to issue an order requiring the bank or savings association to correct a safety and soundness deficiency or to take or refrain from taking other actions pursuant to section 39 of the FDI Act. The national bank or Federal savings association shall have such time to respond to a proposed order as provided by the OCC under paragraph (c) of this section.

    (2)  If the OCC finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of section 39 of the FDI Act, the OCC may, without providing the notice prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, issue an order requiring a national bank or Federal savings association immediately to take actions to correct a safety and soundness deficiency or take or refrain from taking other actions pursuant to section 39. A national bank or Federal savings association that is subject to such an immediately effective order may submit a written appeal of the order to the OCC. Such an appeal must be received by the OCC within 14 calendar days of the issuance of the order, unless the OCC permits a longer period. The OCC shall consider any such appeal, if filed in a timely manner, within 60 days of receiving the appeal. During such period of review, the order shall remain in effect unless the OCC, in its sole discretion, stays the effectiveness of the order.

    (b)  A notice of intent to issue an order shall include:

    (1) A statement of the safety and soundness deficiency or deficiencies that have been identified at the national bank or Federal savings association;

    (2) A description of any restrictions, prohibitions, or affirmative actions that the OCC proposes to impose or require;

    (3) The proposed date when such restrictions or prohibitions would be effective or the proposed date for completion of any required action; and

    (4) The date by which the national bank or Federal savings association subject to the order may file with the OCC a written response to the notice.

    (c) —(1)  A national bank or Federal savings association may file a written response to a notice of intent to issue an order within the time period set by the OCC. Such a response must be received by the OCC within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless the OCC determines that a different period is appropriate in light of the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association or other relevant circumstances.

    (2)  The response should include:

    (i) An explanation why the action proposed by the OCC is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under section 39;

    (ii) Any recommended modification of the proposed order; and

    (iii) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the national bank or Federal savings association regarding the proposed order.

    (d)  After considering the response, the OCC may:

    (1) Issue the order as proposed or in modified form;

    (2) Determine not to issue the order and so notify the national bank or Federal savings association; or

    (3) Seek additional information or clarification of the response from the national bank or Federal savings association, or any other relevant source.

    (e)  Failure by a national bank or Federal savings association to file with the OCC, within the specified time period, a written response to a proposed order shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and shall constitute consent to the issuance of the order.

    (f)  Any national bank or Federal savings association that is subject to an order under this part may, upon a change in circumstances, request in writing that the OCC reconsider the terms of the order, and may propose that the order be rescinded or modified. Unless otherwise ordered by the OCC, the order shall continue in place while such request is pending before the OCC.

    (b)  Pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(i)(2)(A), the OCC may assess a civil money penalty against any national bank or Federal savings association that violates or otherwise fails to comply with any final order issued under section 39 and against any institution-affiliated party who participates in such violation or noncompliance.

    (c)  In addition to the actions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the OCC may seek enforcement of the provisions of section 39 or this part through any other judicial or administrative proceeding authorized by law.

    (ii) Operating subsidiaries;

    (iii) Edge Act or Agreement Corporation subsidiaries; or

    (iv) Any other subsidiary consolidated with the bank or savings association under GAAP.

    (3) The lending limits in this part are separate and independent from the investment limits prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) or 12 U.S.C. 1464(c), as applicable, and 12 CFR Part 1 and 12 CFR 160.30, and a national bank or savings association may make loans or extensions of credit to one borrower up to the full amount permitted by this part and also hold eligible securities of the same obligor up to the full amount permitted under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) or 12 U.S.C. 1464(c), as applicable, and 12 CFR part 1 and 12 CFR 160.30.

    (4) Loans and extensions of credit to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of national banks, savings associations, and their related interests are subject to limits prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 375a and 375b in addition to the lending limits established by 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u) as applicable, and this part.

    (5) In addition to the foregoing, loans and extensions of credit must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

    (d)  The requirements of this part shall not apply to the credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction or securities financing transaction until October 1, 2013.

    (1) Loans or extensions of credit for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part include—

    (i) A contractual commitment to advance funds, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section;

    (iii) A national bank's or savings association's purchase of third-party paper subject to an agreement that the seller will repurchase the paper upon default or at the end of a stated period. The amount of the bank's or savings association's loan is the total unpaid balance of the paper owned by the bank or savings association less any applicable dealer reserves retained by the bank or savings association and held by the bank or savings association as collateral security. Where the seller's obligation to repurchase is limited, the bank's or savings association's loan is measured by the total amount of the paper the seller may ultimately be obligated to repurchase. A national bank's or savings association's purchase of third party paper without direct or indirect recourse to the seller is not a loan or extension of credit to the seller;

    (iv) An overdraft, whether or not prearranged, but not an intra-day overdraft for which payment is received before the close of business of the national bank or savings association that makes the funds available;

    (v) The sale of Federal funds with a maturity of more than one business day, but not Federal funds with a maturity of one day or less or Federal funds sold under a continuing contract; and

    (A) Is unenforceable by reason of discharge in bankruptcy;

    (B) Is no longer legally enforceable because of expiration of the statute of limitations or a judicial decision;

    (C) Is no longer legally enforceable for other reasons, provided that the bank or savings association maintains sufficient records to demonstrate that the loan is unenforceable.

    (2) The following items do not constitute loans or extensions of credit for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part—

    (i) Additional funds advanced for the benefit of a borrower by a national bank or savings association for payment of taxes, insurance, utilities, security, and maintenance and operating expenses necessary to preserve the value of real property securing the loan, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, but only if the advance is for the protection of the bank's or savings association's interest in the collateral, and provided that such amounts must be treated as an extension of credit if a new loan or extension of credit is made to the borrower;

    (ii) Accrued and discounted interest on an existing loan or extension of credit, including interest that has been capitalized from prior notes and interest that has been advanced under terms and conditions of a loan agreement;

    (iii) Financed sales of a national bank's or savings association's own assets, including Other Real Estate Owned, if the financing does not put the bank or savings association in a worse position than when the bank or savings association held title to the assets;

    (iv) A renewal or restructuring of a loan as a new “loan or extension of credit,” following the exercise by a national bank or savings association of reasonable efforts, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to bring the loan into conformance with the lending limit, unless new funds are advanced by the national bank or savings association to the borrower (except as permitted by § 32.3(b)(5)), or a new borrower replaces the original borrower, or unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that a renewal or restructuring was undertaken as a means to evade the bank's or savings association's lending limit;

    (v) Amounts paid against uncollected funds in the normal process of collection;

    (vi)(A) That portion of a loan or extension of credit sold as a participation by a national bank or savings association on a nonrecourse basis, provided that the participation results in a pro rata sharing of credit risk proportionate to the respective interests of the originating and participating lenders. Where a participation agreement provides that repayment must be applied first to the portions sold, a pro rata sharing will be deemed to exist only if the agreement also provides that, in the event of a default or comparable event defined in the agreement, participants must share in all subsequent repayments and collections in proportion to their percentage participation at the time of the occurrence of the event.

    (B) When an originating national bank or savings association funds the entire loan, it must receive funding from the participants before the close of business of its next business day. If the participating portions are not received within that period, then the portions funded will be treated as a loan by the originating bank or savings association to the borrower. If the portions so attributed to the borrower exceed the originating bank's or savings association's lending limit, the loan may be treated as nonconforming subject to § 32.6, rather than a violation, if:

    () The originating national bank or savings association had a valid and unconditional participation agreement with a participant or participants that was sufficient to reduce the loan to within the originating bank's or savings association's lending limit;

    () The participant reconfirmed its participation and the originating national bank or savings association had no knowledge of any information that would permit the participant to withhold its participation; and

    () The participation was to be funded by close of business of the originating national bank's or savings association's next business day; and

    (vii) That portion of one or more loans or extensions of credit, not to exceed 10 percent of capital and surplus, with respect to which the national bank or savings association has purchased protection in the form of a single-name credit derivative that meets the requirements of § 32.2(m)(1) through (7) from an eligible protection provider if the reference obligor is the same legal entity as the borrower in the loan or extension of credit and the maturity of the protection purchased equals or exceeds the maturity of the loan or extension of credit.

    (r)  means an individual; sole proprietorship; partnership; joint venture; association; trust; estate; business trust; corporation; limited liability company; not-for-profit corporation; sovereign government or agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof; or any similar entity or organization; and

    (s)  has the same meaning as this term has in 12 CFR 3.2.

    (t)  means a legally binding written commitment to lend that, when combined with all other outstanding loans and qualifying commitments to a borrower, was within the national bank's or savings association's lending limit when entered into, and has not been disqualified.

    (1) In determining whether a commitment is within the national bank's or savings association's lending limit when made, the bank or savings association may deduct from the amount of the commitment the amount of any legally binding loan participation commitments that are issued concurrent with the bank's or savings association's commitment and that would be excluded from the definition of “loan or extension of credit” under paragraph (q)(2)(vi) of this section.

    (2) If the national bank or savings association subsequently chooses to make an additional loan and that subsequent loan, together with all outstanding loans and qualifying commitments to a borrower, exceeds the bank's or savings association's applicable lending limit at that time, the bank's or savings association's qualifying commitments to the borrower that exceed the bank's or savings association's lending limit at that time are deemed to be permanently disqualified, beginning with the most recent qualifying commitment and proceeding in reverse chronological order. When a commitment is disqualified, the entire commitment is disqualified and the disqualified commitment is no longer considered a “loan or extension of credit.” Advances of funds under a disqualified or non-qualifying commitment may only be made to the extent that the advance, together with all other outstanding loans to the borrower, do not exceed the bank's or savings association's lending limit at the time of the advance, calculated pursuant to § 32.4.

    (u)  has the same meaning as this term has in 12 CFR 3.2.

    (v)  means financial instruments and bullion that are salable under ordinary market conditions with reasonable promptness at a fair market value determined by quotations based upon actual transactions on an auction or similarly available daily bid and ask price market.

    (w)  means an article of commerce, agriculture, or industry, such as wheat and other grains, cotton, wool, and basic metals such as tin, copper and lead, in the form of standardized interchangeable units, that is easy to sell in a market with sufficiently frequent price quotations.

    (1) An article comes within this definition if—

    (i) The exact price is easy to determine; and

    (ii) The staple itself is easy to sell at any time at a price that would not be considerably less than the amount at which it is valued as collateral.

    (2) Whether an article qualifies as a readily marketable staple is determined on the basis of the conditions existing at the time the loan or extension of credit that is secured by the staples is made.

    (x)  mean:

    (1) Homes (including a dwelling unit in a multi-family residential property such as a condominium or a cooperative);

    (2) Combinations of homes and business property ( a home used in part for business);

    (3) Other real estate used for primarily residential purposes other than a home (but which may include homes);

    (4) Combinations of such real estate and business property involving only minor business use ( where no more than 20 percent of the total appraised value of the real estate is attributable to the business use);

    (5) Farm residences and combinations of farm residences and commercial farm real estate;

    (6) Property to be improved by the construction of such structures; or

    (7) Leasehold interests in the above real estate.

    (y)  means a loan or extension of credit that is secured by 1-4 family residential real estate.

    (ee)  means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, that represents an obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer:

    (1) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party;

    (2) To make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party; or

    (3) To make payment on account of any default by the account party in the performance of an obligation.

    § 32.3   Lending limits.

#### § § 32.3

    (a)  A national bank's or savings association's total outstanding loans and extensions of credit to one borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus, if the amount that exceeds the bank's or savings association's 15 percent general limit is fully secured by readily marketable collateral, as defined in § 32.2(v). To qualify for the additional 10 percent limit, the bank or savings association must perfect a security interest in the collateral under applicable law and the collateral must have a current market value at all times of at least 100 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit that exceeds the bank's or savings association's 15 percent general limit.

    (b)  The following loans or extensions of credit are subject to the lending limits set forth below. When loans and extensions of credit qualify for more than one special lending limit, the special limits are cumulative.

    (1)  (i) A national bank's or savings association's loans or extensions of credit to one borrower secured by bills of lading, warehouse receipts, or similar documents transferring or securing title to readily marketable staples, as defined in § 32.2(w), may not exceed 35 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. The market value of the staples securing the loan must at all times equal at least 115 percent of the amount of the outstanding loan that exceeds the bank's or savings association's combined general limit.

    (ii) Staples that qualify for this special limit must be nonperishable, may be refrigerated or frozen, and must be fully covered by insurance if such insurance is customary. Whether a staple is non-perishable must be determined on a case-by-case basis because of differences in handling and storing commodities.

    (iii) This special limit applies to a loan or extension of credit arising from a single transaction or secured by the same staples, provided that the duration of the loan or extension of credit is:

    (A) Not more than ten months if secured by nonperishable staples; or

    (B) Not more than six months if secured by refrigerated or frozen staples.

    (iv) The holder of the warehouse receipts, order bills of lading, documents qualifying as documents of title under the Uniform Commercial Code, or other similar documents, must have control and be able to obtain immediate possession of the staple so that the bank or savings association is able to sell the underlying staples and promptly transfer title and possession to a purchaser if default should occur on a loan secured by such documents. The existence of a brief notice period, or similar procedural requirements under applicable law, for the disposal of the collateral will not affect the eligibility of the instruments for this special limit.

    (A) Field warehouse receipts are an acceptable form of collateral when issued by a duly bonded and licensed grain elevator or warehouse having exclusive possession and control of the staples even though the grain elevator or warehouse is maintained on the premises of the owner of the staples.

    (B) Warehouse receipts issued by the borrower-owner that is a grain elevator or warehouse company, duly-bonded and licensed and regularly inspected by state or Federal authorities, may be considered eligible collateral under this provision only when the receipts are registered with an independent registrar whose consent is required before the staples may be withdrawn from the warehouse.

    (2)  (i) A national bank's or savings association's loans and extensions of credit to one borrower that arise from the discount of negotiable or nonnegotiable installment consumer paper, as defined at § 32.2(f), that carries a full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee by the person selling the paper, may not exceed 10 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. An unconditional guarantee may be in the form of a repurchase agreement or separate guarantee agreement. A condition reasonably within the power of the bank or savings association to perform, such as the repossession of collateral, will not make conditional an otherwise unconditional guarantee.

    (ii) Where the seller of the paper offers only partial recourse to the bank or savings association, the lending limits of this section apply to the obligation of the seller to the bank or savings association, which is measured by the total amount of paper the seller may be obligated to repurchase or has guaranteed.

    (iii) Where the bank or savings association is relying primarily upon the maker of the paper for payment of the loans or extensions of credit and not upon any full or partial recourse endorsement or guarantee by the seller of the paper, the lending limits of this section apply only to the maker. The bank or savings association must substantiate its reliance on the maker with—

    (A) Records supporting the bank's or savings association's independent credit analysis of the maker's ability to repay the loan or extension of credit, maintained by the bank or savings association or by a third party that is contractually obligated to make those records available for examination purposes; and

    (B) A written certification by an officer of the bank or savings association authorized by the bank's or savings association's board of directors or any designee of that officer, that the bank or savings association is relying primarily upon the maker to repay the loan or extension of credit.

    (iv) Where paper is purchased in substantial quantities, the records, evaluation, and certification must be in a form appropriate for the class and quantity of paper involved. The bank or savings association may use sampling techniques, or other appropriate methods, to independently verify the reliability of the credit information supplied by the seller.

    (3)  (i) A national bank's or savings association's loans or extensions of credit to one borrower secured by shipping documents or instruments that transfer or secure title to or give a first lien on livestock may not exceed 10 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. The market value of the livestock securing the loan must at all times equal at least 115 percent of the amount of the outstanding loan that exceeds the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. For purposes of this subsection, the term “livestock” includes dairy and beef cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, horses, mules, poultry and fish, whether or not held for resale.

    (ii) The bank or savings association must maintain in its files an inspection and valuation for the livestock pledged that is reasonably current, taking into account the nature and frequency of turnover of the livestock to which the documents relate, but in any case not more than 12 months old.

    (iii) Under the laws of certain states, persons furnishing pasturage under a grazing contract may have a lien on the livestock for the amount due for pasturage. If a lien that is based on pasturage furnished by the lienor prior to the bank's or savings association's loan or extension of credit is assigned to the bank or savings association by a recordable instrument and protected against being defeated by some other lien or claim, by payment to a person other than the bank or savings association, or otherwise, it will qualify under this exception provided the amount of the perfected lien is at least equal to the amount of the loan and the value of the livestock is at no time less than 115 percent of the portion of the loan or extension of credit that exceeds the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. When the amount due under the grazing contract is dependent upon future performance, the resulting lien does not meet the requirements of the exception.

    (4)  A national bank's or savings association's loans and extensions of credit to one borrower that arise from the discount by dealers in dairy cattle of paper given in payment for the cattle may not exceed 10 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the bank's or savings association's combined general limit. To qualify, the paper—

    (i) Must carry the full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee of the seller; and

    (ii) Must be secured by the cattle being sold, pursuant to liens that allow the bank or savings association to maintain a perfected security interest in the cattle under applicable law.

    (5)  A national bank or savings association may renew a qualifying commitment to lend, as defined by § 32.2(t), and complete funding under that commitment if all of the following criteria are met—

    (i) The completion of funding is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and is made to protect the position of the bank or savings association;

    (ii) The completion of funding will enable the borrower to complete the project for which the qualifying commitment to lend was made; and

    (iii) The amount of the additional funding does not exceed the unfunded portion of the bank's or savings association's qualifying commitment to lend.

    (c)  The following loans or extensions of credit are not subject to the lending limits of 12 U.S.C. 84, or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, of this part.

    (1)  (i) Loans or extensions of credit arising from the discount of negotiable commercial or business paper that evidences an obligation to the person negotiating the paper. The paper—

    (A) Must be given in payment of the purchase price of commodities purchased for resale, fabrication of a product, or any other business purpose that may reasonably be expected to provide funds for payment of the paper; and

    (B) Must bear the full recourse endorsement of the owner of the paper, except that paper discounted in connection with export transactions, that is transferred without recourse, or with limited recourse, must be supported by an assignment of appropriate insurance covering the political, credit, and transfer risks applicable to the paper, such as insurance provided by the Export-Import Bank.

    (ii) A failure to pay principal or interest on commercial or business paper when due does not result in a loan or extension of credit to the maker or endorser of the paper; however, the amount of such paper thereafter must be counted in determining whether additional loans or extensions of credit to the same borrower may be made within the limits of 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part.

    (2)  A national bank's or savings association's acceptance of drafts eligible for rediscount under 12 U.S.C. 372 and 373 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(1)(M), as applicable, or a national bank's or savings association's purchase of acceptances created by other banks or savings associations that are eligible for rediscount under those sections; but not including—

    (i) A national bank's or savings association's acceptance of drafts ineligible for rediscount (which constitutes a loan by the bank or savings association to the customer for whom the acceptance was made, in the amount of the draft);

    (ii) A national bank's or savings association's purchase of ineligible acceptances created by other banks or savings associations (which constitutes a loan from the purchasing bank or savings association to the accepting bank or savings association, in the amount of the purchase price); and

    (iii) A national bank's or savings association's purchase of its own acceptances (which constitutes a loan to the bank's or savings association's customer for whom the acceptance was made, in the amount of the purchase price).

    (3)(i)  Loans or extensions of credit, or portions thereof, to the extent fully secured by the current market value of:

    (A) Bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or by similar obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;

    (4)  (i) Loans or extensions of credit to any department, agency, bureau, board, commission, or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States.

    (ii) Loans or extensions of credit, including portions thereof, to the extent secured by unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any of the foregoing governmental entities. The commitment or guarantee—

    (A) Must be payable in cash or its equivalent within 60 days after demand for payment is made;

    (B) Is considered unconditional if the protection afforded the national bank or savings association is not substantially diminished or impaired if loss should result from factors beyond the bank's or savings association's control. Protection against loss is not materially diminished or impaired by procedural requirements, such as an agreement to pay on the obligation only in the event of default, including default over a specific period of time, a requirement that notification of default be given within a specific period after its occurrence, or a requirement of good faith on the part of the bank or savings association.

    (5)  (i) A loan or extension of credit to a State or political subdivision that constitutes a general obligation of the State or political subdivision, as defined in part 1 of this chapter, and for which the lending national bank or savings association has an opinion of counsel or the opinion of that State Attorney General, or other State legal official with authority to opine on the obligation in question, that the loan or extension of credit is a valid and enforceable general obligation of the borrower; and

    (ii) A loan or extension of credit, including portions thereof, to the extent guaranteed or secured by a general obligation of a State or political subdivision and for which the lending bank or savings association has an opinion of counsel or the opinion of that State Attorney General, or other State legal official with authority to opine on the guarantee or collateral in question, that the guarantee or collateral is a valid and enforceable general obligation of that public body.

    (6)  Loans or extensions of credit, including portions thereof, to the extent secured by a segregated deposit account in the lending national bank or savings association, provided a security interest in the deposit has been perfected under applicable law.

    (i) Where the deposit is eligible for withdrawal before the secured loan matures, the bank or savings association must establish internal procedures to prevent release of the security without the lending bank's or savings association's prior consent.

    (ii) A deposit that is denominated and payable in a currency other than that of the loan or extension of credit that it secures may be eligible for this exception if the currency is freely convertible to U.S. dollars.

    (A) This exception applies to only that portion of the loan or extension of credit that is covered by the U.S. dollar value of the deposit.

    (B) The lending bank or savings association must establish procedures to periodically revalue foreign currency deposits to ensure that the loan or extension of credit remains fully secured at all times.

    (7)  Loans or extensions of credit to any financial institution or to any receiver, conservator, superintendent of banks, or other agent in charge of the business and property of a financial institution when an emergency situation exists and a national bank or savings association is asked to provide assistance to another financial institution, and the loan is approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency. For purposes of this paragraph, financial institution means a commercial bank, savings bank, trust company, savings association, or credit union.

    (8)  Loans or extensions of credit to the Student Loan Marketing Association.

    (9)  A loan or extension of credit to an industrial development authority or similar public entity created to construct and lease a plant facility, including a health care facility, to an industrial occupant will be deemed a loan to the lessee, provided that—

    (i) The national bank or savings association evaluates the creditworthiness of the industrial occupant before the loan is extended to the authority;

    (ii) The authority's liability on the loan is limited solely to whatever interest it has in the particular facility;

    (iii) The authority's interest is assigned to the bank or savings association as security for the loan or the industrial occupant issues a promissory note to the bank or savings association that provides a higher order of security than the assignment of a lease; and

    (iv) The industrial occupant's lease rentals are assigned and paid directly to the bank or savings association.

    (10)  A loan or extension of credit to a leasing company for the purpose of purchasing equipment for lease will be deemed a loan to the lessee, provided that—

    (i) The national bank or savings association evaluates the creditworthiness of the lessee before the loan is extended to the leasing corporation;

    (ii) The loan is without recourse to the leasing corporation;

    (iii) The bank or savings association is given a security interest in the equipment and in the event of default, may proceed directly against the equipment and the lessee for any deficiency resulting from the sale of the equipment;

    (iv) The leasing corporation assigns all of its rights under the lease to the bank or savings association;

    (v) The lessee's lease payments are assigned and paid to the bank or savings association; and

    (12)  Intraday credit exposures arising from a derivative transaction or securities financing transaction.

    (d) —(1)  If a savings association's aggregate lending limitation calculated under paragraph (a) of this section is less than $500,000, notwithstanding this limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, such savings association may have total loans and extensions of credit, for any purpose, to one borrower outstanding at one time not to exceed $500,000.

    (2)  (i) Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a savings association may make loans to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units, not to exceed the lesser of $30,000,000 or 30 percent of the savings association's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, including all loans and extensions of credit subject to paragraph (a) of this section,

    (A) The savings association is, and continues to be, in compliance with 12 CFR part 3, part 390, subpart Z, or part 324, as applicable;

    (B) Upon application by a savings association under paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency permits, subject to conditions it may impose, the savings association to use the higher limit set forth under this paragraph (d)(2)(i);

    (ii) The authority of a savings association to make a loan or extension of credit under the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section ceases immediately upon the association's failure to comply with any one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or any condition(s) set forth in an order issued by the appropriate Federal banking agency under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (d)(2)(iv) of this section.

    § 32.4   Calculation of lending limits.

#### § § 32.4

    (a)  For purposes of determining compliance with 12 U.S.C. 84, and 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part, a national bank or savings association shall determine its lending limit as of the most recent of the following dates:

    (1) The last day of the preceding calendar quarter; or

    (2) The date on which there is a change in the bank's or savings association's capital category for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.3 or 12 CFR 324.402, as applicable.

    (b)  (1) A national bank's or savings association's lending limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be effective as of the earlier of the following dates:

    (i) The date on which the bank's or savings association's Call Report is submitted; or

    (ii) The date on which the bank's or savings association's Call Report is required to be submitted.

    (c)  If the appropriate Federal banking agency determines for safety and soundness reasons that a national bank or savings association should calculate its lending limit more frequently than required by paragraph (a) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide written notice to the national bank or savings association directing it to calculate its lending limit at a more frequent interval, and the national bank or savings association shall thereafter calculate its lending limit at that interval until further notice.

    § 32.5   Combination rules.

#### § § 32.5

    (a)  Loans or extensions of credit to one borrower will be attributed to another person and each person will be deemed a borrower—

    (1) When proceeds of a loan or extension of credit are to be used for the direct benefit of the other person, to the extent of the proceeds so used; or

    (2) When a common enterprise is deemed to exist between the persons.

    (b)  The proceeds of a loan or extension of credit to a borrower will be deemed to be used for the direct benefit of another person and will be attributed to the other person when the proceeds, or assets purchased with the proceeds, are transferred to another person, other than in a bona fide arm's length transaction where the proceeds are used to acquire property, goods, or services.

    (c)  A common enterprise will be deemed to exist and loans to separate borrowers will be aggregated:

    (1) When the expected source of repayment for each loan or extension of credit is the same for each borrower and neither borrower has another source of income from which the loan (together with the borrower's other obligations) may be fully repaid. An employer will not be treated as a source of repayment under this paragraph because of wages and salaries paid to an employee, unless the standards of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met;

    (2) When loans or extensions of credit are made—

    (i) To borrowers who are related directly or indirectly through common control, including where one borrower is directly or indirectly controlled by another borrower; and

    (ii) Substantial financial interdependence exists between or among the borrowers. Substantial financial interdependence is deemed to exist when 50 percent or more of one borrower's gross receipts or gross expenditures (on an annual basis) are derived from transactions with the other borrower. Gross receipts and expenditures include gross revenues/expenses, intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions, and similar receipts or payments;

    (3) When separate persons borrow from a national bank or savings association to acquire a business enterprise of which those borrowers will own more than 50 percent of the voting securities or voting interests, in which case a common enterprise is deemed to exist between the borrowers for purposes of combining the acquisition loans; or

    (4) When the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of particular transactions, that a common enterprise exists.

    (d)  (1) Loans or extensions of credit by a national bank or savings association to a corporate group may not exceed 50 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus. This limitation applies only to loans subject to the combined general limit. A corporate group includes a person and all of its subsidiaries. For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation or a limited liability company is a subsidiary of a person if the person owns or beneficially owns directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of the voting securities or voting interests of the corporation or company.

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, loans or extensions of credit to a person and its subsidiary, or to different subsidiaries of a person, are not combined unless either the direct benefit or the common enterprise test is met.

    (e) —(1)  Loans or extensions of credit to a partnership, joint venture, or association are deemed to be loans or extensions of credit to each member of the partnership, joint venture, or association. This rule does not apply to limited partners in limited partnerships or to members of joint ventures or associations if the partners or members, by the terms of the partnership or membership agreement, are not held generally liable for the debts or actions of the partnership, joint venture, or association, and those provisions are valid under applicable law.

    (2)  (i) Loans or extensions of credit to members of a partnership, joint venture, or association are not attributed to the partnership, joint venture, or association unless either the direct benefit or the common enterprise tests are met. Both the direct benefit and common enterprise tests are met between a member of a partnership, joint venture or association and such partnership, joint venture or association, when loans or extensions of credit are made to the member to purchase an interest in the partnership, joint venture or association.

    (ii) Loans or extensions of credit to members of a partnership, joint venture, or association are not attributed to other members of the partnership, joint venture, or association unless either the direct benefit or common enterprise test is met.

    (f) —(1)  Loans and extensions of credit to foreign governments, their agencies, and instrumentalities will be aggregated with one another only if the loans or extensions of credit fail to meet either the means test or the purpose test at the time the loan or extension of credit is made.

    (i) The means test is satisfied if the borrower has resources or revenue of its own sufficient to service its debt obligations. If the government's support (excluding guarantees by a central government of the borrower's debt) exceeds the borrower's annual revenues from other sources, it will be presumed that the means test has not been satisfied.

    (ii) The purpose test is satisfied if the purpose of the loan or extension of credit is consistent with the purposes of the borrower's general business.

    (2)  In order to show that the means and purpose tests have been satisfied, a national bank or savings association must, at a minimum, retain in its files the following items:

    (i) A statement (accompanied by supporting documentation) describing the legal status and the degree of financial and operational autonomy of the borrowing entity;

    (ii) Financial statements for the borrowing entity for a minimum of three years prior to the date the loan or extension of credit was made or for each year that the borrowing entity has been in existence, if less than three;

    (iii) Financial statements for each year the loan or extension of credit is outstanding;

    (iv) The national bank's or savings association's assessment of the borrower's means of servicing the loan or extension of credit, including specific reasons in support of that assessment. The assessment shall include an analysis of the borrower's financial history, its present and projected economic and financial performance, and the significance of any financial support provided to the borrower by third parties, including the borrower's central government; and

    (v) A loan agreement or other written statement from the borrower which clearly describes the purpose of the loan or extension of credit. The written representation will ordinarily constitute sufficient evidence that the purpose test has been satisfied. However, when, at the time the funds are disbursed, the bank or savings association knows or has reason to know of other information suggesting that the borrower will use the proceeds in a manner inconsistent with the written representation, it may not, without further inquiry, accept the representation.

    (3) —(i)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, when previously outstanding loans and other extensions of credit to a foreign government, its agencies, and instrumentalities (i.e., public-sector obligors) that qualified for a separate lending limit under paragraph (f)(1) of this section are consolidated under a central obligor in a qualifying restructuring, such loans will not be aggregated and attributed to the central obligor. This includes any substitution in named obligors, solely because of the restructuring. Such loans (other than loans originally attributed to the central obligor in their own right) will not be considered obligations of the central obligor and will continue to be attributed to the original public-sector obligor for purposes of the lending limit.

    (ii)  Loans and other extensions of credit to a foreign government, its agencies, and instrumentalities will qualify for the non-combination process under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section only if they are restructured in a sovereign debt restructuring approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency, upon request by a national bank or savings association for application of the non combination rule. The factors that the appropriate Federal banking agency will use in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the following:

    (A) Whether the restructuring involves a substantial portion of the total commercial bank loans outstanding to the foreign government, its agencies, and instrumentalities;

    (B) Whether the restructuring involves a substantial number of the foreign country's external commercial bank creditors;

    (C) Whether the restructuring and consolidation under a central obligor is being done primarily to facilitate external debt management; and

    (D) Whether the restructuring includes features of debt or debt-service reduction.

    (iii)  With respect to any case in which the non-combination process under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section applies, a national bank's or savings association's loans and other extensions of credit to a foreign government, its agencies and instrumentalities, (including restructured debt) shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 50 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus.

    § 32.6   Nonconforming loans and extensions of credit.

#### § § 32.6

    (a) A loan or extension of credit, within a national bank's or savings association's legal lending limit when made, will not be deemed a violation but will be treated as nonconforming if the loan or extension of credit is no longer in conformity with the bank's or savings association's lending limit because—

    (1) The bank's or savings association's capital has declined, borrowers have subsequently merged or formed a common enterprise, lenders have merged, or the lending limit or capital rules have changed;

    (2) Collateral securing the loan to satisfy the requirements of a lending limit exception has declined in value; or

    (3) In the case of a credit exposure arising from a transaction identified in § 32.9(a) and measured by the Model Method specified in § 32.9(b)(1)(i) or § 32.9 (c)(1)(i), the Current Exposure Method specified in § 32.9(b)(1)(iii), or the Basel Collateral Haircut Method specified in § 32.9(c)(1)(iii), the credit exposure subject to the lending limits of 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, or this part increases after execution of the transaction.

    (b) A national bank or savings association must use reasonable efforts to bring a loan or extension of credit that is nonconforming as a result of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section into conformity with the bank's or savings association's lending limit unless to do so would be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.

    (c) A national bank or savings association must bring a loan that is nonconforming as a result of circumstances described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section into conformity with the bank's or savings association's lending limit within 30 calendar days, except when judicial proceedings, regulatory actions or other extraordinary circumstances beyond the bank's or savings association's control prevent it from taking action.

Any such loan or extension of credit must be secured by a perfected first-lien security interest in 1-4 family real estate in an amount that does not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the collateral at the time the loan or extension of credit is made.

    (2) In addition to the amount that a national bank or savings association may lend to one borrower under § 32.3, an eligible national bank or eligible savings association may make loans to small businesses to one borrower in the lesser of the following two amounts: 10 percent of its capital and surplus; or the percent of its capital and surplus, in excess of 15 percent, that a State bank is permitted to lend under the state lending limit that is available for loans to small businesses or unsecured loans in the state where the main office of the national bank or home office of the savings association is located.

    (3) In addition to the amount that a national bank or savings association may lend to one borrower under § 32.3, an eligible national bank or eligible savings association may make loans or extensions of credit to small farms to one borrower in the lesser of the following two amounts: 10 percent of its capital and surplus; or the percent of its capital and surplus, in excess of 15 percent, that a State bank or savings association is permitted to lend under the State lending limit that is available for loans or extensions of credit to small farms or unsecured loans in the State where the main office of the national bank or savings association is located.

    (4) The total outstanding amount of a national bank's or savings association's loans and extensions of credit to one borrower made under § 32.3(a) and (b), together with loans and extensions of credit to the borrower made pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, shall not exceed 25 percent of the bank's or savings association's capital and surplus.

    (b)  An eligible national bank or eligible savings association must submit an application to, and receive approval from, its supervisory office before using the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. The supervisory office may approve a completed application if it finds that approval is consistent with safety and soundness. To be deemed complete, the application must include:

    (1) Certification that the bank or savings association is an “eligible bank” or “eligible savings association”;

    (2) Citations to relevant State laws or regulations;

    (3) A copy of a written resolution by a majority of the bank's or savings association's board of directors approving the use of the limits provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and confirming the terms and conditions for use of this lending authority; and

    (4) A description of how the board will exercise its continuing responsibility to oversee the use of this lending authority.

    (d)  The appropriate supervisory office may rescind a bank's or savings association's authority to use the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section based upon concerns about credit quality, undue concentrations in the bank's or savings association's portfolio of residential real estate, loans to small businesses, or loans or extensions of credit to small farms, or concerns about the bank's or savings association's overall credit risk management systems and controls. The bank or savings association must cease making new loans or extensions of credit in reliance on the supplemental lending limits upon receipt of written notice from the appropriate supervisory office that its authority has been rescinded.

    (e)  Any loans or extensions of credit made by a bank or savings association under the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, that were in compliance with this section when made, will not be deemed a lending limit violation and will not be treated as nonconforming under § 32.6.

    (a)  This section sets forth the rules for calculating the credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction or a securities financing transaction entered into by a national bank or savings association for purposes of determining the bank's or savings association's lending limit pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part.

    (b) —(1)  Subject to paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, a national bank or savings association shall calculate the credit exposure to a counterparty arising from a derivative transaction by one of the following methods. Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a national bank or savings association shall use the same method for calculating counterparty credit exposure arising from all of its derivative transactions.

    (i) —(A)  The credit exposure of a derivative transaction under the Internal _Model Method_ shall equal the sum of the current credit exposure of the derivative transaction and the potential future credit exposure of the derivative transaction.

    (B)  A bank or savings association shall determine its current credit exposure by the mark-to-market value of the derivative contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current credit exposure equals that mark-to-market value. If the mark to market value is zero or negative, than the current credit exposure is zero.

    (C)  () A bank or savings association shall calculate its potential future credit exposure by using either:

    () An _i_nternal model the use of which has been approved in writing for purposes of 12 CFR 3.132(d) or 324.132(d), as appropriate, provided that the bank or savings association provides prior written notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency of its use for purposes of this section; or

    () Any other appropriate model the use of which has been approved in writing for purposes of this section by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

    () Any substant_i_ve revisions to a model made after the bank or savings association has provided notice of the use of the model to the appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to paragraph (b)(__1__)(i)(C)()() of this section or after the appropriate Federal banking agency has approved the use of the model pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C)()() of this section must be approved by the agency before a bank or savings association may use the revised model for purposes of this part.

    (D)  A bank or savings association that calculates its credit exposure by using the Internal Model Method pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i) may net credit exposures of derivative transactions arising under the same qualifying master netting agreement.

    (ii)  The credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction under the Conversion Factor Matrix Method shall equal and remain fixed at the potential future credit exposure of the derivative transaction which shall equal the product of the notional amount of the derivative transaction and a fixed multiplicative factor determined by reference to Table 1 of this section.

    (iii)  The credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction (other than a credit derivative transaction) under the Current Exposure Method shall be calculated pursuant to 12 CFR 3.34(b)(1) and (2) and (c) or 324.34(b)(1) and (2) and (c), as appropriate.

    (iv)  The credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction (other than a credit derivative transaction) under the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk Method shall be calculated pursuant to 12 CFR 3.132(c)(5) or 324.132(c)(5), as appropriate.

    (2) —(i) —(A)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a national bank or savings association that uses the Conversion Factor Matrix Method or the Current Exposure Method, or that uses the Model Method without entering an effective margining arrangement as defined in § 32.2(l), shall calculate the counterparty credit exposure arising from credit derivatives entered by the bank or savings association by adding the net notional value of all protection purchased from the counterparty on each reference entity.

    (B)  A bank or savings association must add the _EMA threshold_ amount to the counterparty credit exposure arising from credit derivatives calculated under the Model Method. The  is the amount under an effective margining arrangement with respect to which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin to fully collateralize the amount of the bank's or savings association's net credit exposure to the counterparty.

    (ii)  A national bank or savings association shall calculate the credit exposure to a reference entity arising from credit derivatives entered into by the bank or savings association by adding the net notional value of all protection sold on the reference entity. A bank or savings association may reduce its exposure to a reference entity by the amount of any eligible credit derivative purchased on that reference entity from an eligible protection provider.

    (3)  (i) In addition to amounts calculated under § 32.9(b)(1) and (2), the measure of counterparty exposure to a central counterparty shall also include the sum of the initial margin posted by the bank or savings association, plus any contributions made by it to a guaranty fund at the time such contribution is made.

    (ii) Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to a national bank or saving association that uses an internal model pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if such model reflects the initial margin and any contributions to a guaranty fund.

    (4)  The appropriate Federal banking agency may in its discretion require or permit a national bank or savings association to use a specific method or methods set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to calculate the credit exposure arising from all derivative transactions or any specific, or category of, derivative transactions if it finds, in its discretion, that such method is consistent with the safety and soundness of the bank or savings association.

    (c) —(1)  Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a national bank or savings association shall calculate the credit exposure arising from a securities financing transaction by one of the following methods. A national bank or savings association shall use the same method for calculating credit exposure arising from all of its securities financing transactions.

    (i)  (A) A national bank or savings association may calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing transaction by using either:

    () An internal model the use of which has been approved in writing by the appropriate Federal banking agency for purposes of _1_2 CFR 3.132(b) or 324.132(b), as appropriate, provided the bank or savings association provides prior written notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency of its use for purposes of this section; or

    () Any other appropriate model the use of which has been approved in writing for purposes of this section by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

    (B) Any substantive revisions to a model made after the bank or savings association has provided notice of the use of the model to the appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to paragraph (c)(_1_)(i)(A)() of this section or after the appropriate Federal banking agency has approved the use of the model pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)() of this section must be approved by the agency before a bank or savings association may use the revised model for purposes of part 3_2_.

    (ii)  A national bank or savings association may calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing transaction as follows:

    (A)  The credit exposure arising from a repurchase agreement shall equal and remain fixed at the market value at execution of the transaction of the securities transferred to the other party less cash received.

    (B) — ()  The credit exposure arising from a securities lending transaction where the collateral is cash shall equal and remain fixed at the market value at execution of the transaction of securities transferred less cash received.

    ()  The credit exposure arising from a securities lending transaction where the collateral is other securities shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the higher of the two haircuts associated with the two securities, as determined in Table _2_ of this section, and the higher of the two par values of the securities. Where more than one security is provided as collateral, the applicable haircut is the higher of the haircut associated with the security lent and the notional-weighted average of the haircuts associated with the securities provided as collateral.

    (C)  The credit exposure arising from a reverse repurchase agreement shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the haircut associated with the collateral received, as determined in Table 2 of this section, and the amount of cash transferred.

    (D) —()  The credit exposure arising from a securities borrowed transaction where the collateral is cash shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the haircut on the collateral received, as determined in Table 2 of this section, and the amount of cash transferred to the other party.

    ()  The credit exposure arising from a securities borrowed transaction where the collateral is other securities shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the higher of the two haircuts associated with the two securities, as determined in Table _2_ of this section, and the higher of the two par values of the securities. Where more than one security is provided as collateral, the applicable haircut is the higher of the haircut associated with the security borrowed and the notional-weighted average of the haircuts associated with the securities provided as collateral.

    (iii)  A national bank or savings association may calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing transaction pursuant to 12 CFR 3.132(b)(2)(i) and (ii) or 324.132(b)(2)(i) and (ii), as appropriate.

    (2)  The appropriate Federal banking agency may in its discretion require or permit a national bank or savings association to use a specific method or methods set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate the credit exposure arising from all securities financing transactions or any specific, or category of, securities financing transactions if the appropriate Federal banking agency finds, in its discretion, that such method is consistent with the safety and soundness of the bank or savings association.

      § 34.22   Index.

#### § § 34.22

      (a)  If a national bank makes an ARM loan to which 12 CFR 226.19(b) applies ( the annual percentage rate of a loan may increase after consummation, the term exceeds one year, and the consumer's principal dwelling secures the indebtedness), the loan documents must specify an index or combination of indices to which changes in the interest rate will be linked. This index must be readily available to, and verifiable by, the borrower and beyond the control of the bank. A national bank may use as an index any measure of rates of interest that meets these requirements. The index may be either single values of the chosen measure or a moving average of the chosen measure calculated over a specified period. A national bank also may increase the interest rate in accordance with applicable loan documents specifying the amount of the increase and the times at which, or circumstances under which, it may be made. A national bank may decrease the interest rate at any time.

      (b)  Thirty days after filing a notice with the OCC, a national bank may use an index other than one described in paragraph (a) of this section unless, within that 30-day period, the OCC has notified the bank that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises significant issues of law or policy. If the OCC provides such notice to the bank, the bank may not use that index unless it applies for and receives the OCC's prior written approval.

      (b) Principal payments, in excess of those necessary to retire the outstanding debt over the remaining loan term at the then-current interest rate, that are made in accordance with rules governing the determination of monthly payments contained in the loan documents.

      § 34.24   Nonfederally chartered commercial banks.

#### § § 34.24

      Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3803(a), a State chartered commercial bank may make ARM loans in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. For purposes of this section, the term “State” shall have the same meaning as set forth in § 34.2(b).

      § 34.25   Transition rule.

#### § § 34.25

      (i) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement of new monies; or

      (ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs;

      (8) The transaction involves the purchase, sale, investment in, exchange of, or extension of credit secured by, a loan or interest in a loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgaged-backed securities, and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or real property interest met OCC regulatory requirements for appraisals at the time of origination;

      (9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States government sponsored agency;

      (10) The transaction either:

The regulated institution shall be responsible for making the final determination of whether the appraisal is complex. If during the course of the appraisal a licensed appraiser identifies factors that would result in the property, form of ownership, or market conditions being considered atypical, then either:

      (i) The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and co-sign the appraisal; or

      (ii) The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete the appraisal.

      § 34.45   Appraiser independence.

#### § § 34.45

      (a)  If an appraisal is prepared by a staff appraiser, that appraiser must be independent of the lending, investment, and collection functions and not involved, except as an appraiser, in the federally related transaction, and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property. If the only qualified persons available to perform an appraisal are involved in the lending, investment, or collection functions of the regulated institution, the regulated institution shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the appraisers exercise independent judgment. Such steps include, but are not limited to, prohibiting an individual from performing an appraisal in connection with federally related transactions in which the appraiser is otherwise involved and prohibiting directors and officers from participating in any vote or approval involving assets on which they performed an appraisal.

      (b)  (1) If an appraisal is prepared by a fee appraiser, the appraiser shall be engaged directly by the regulated institution or its agent, and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction.

      (2) A regulated institution also may accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services institution, if:

      (i) The appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction; and

      (ii) The regulated institution determines that the appraisal conforms to the requirements of this subpart and is otherwise acceptable.

#### § § 34.46

      (a)  A State certified appraiser or a State licensed appraiser may not be excluded from consideration for an assignment for a federally related transaction solely by virtue of membership or lack of membership in any particular appraisal organization.

      (b)  All staff and fee appraisers performing appraisals in connection with federally related transactions must be State certified or licensed, as appropriate. However, a State certified or licensed appraiser may not be considered competent solely by virtue of being certified or licensed. Any determination of competency shall be based upon the individual's experience and educational background as they relate to the particular appraisal assignment for which he or she is being considered.

      § 34.47   Enforcement.

      § 34.82   Holding period.

#### § § 34.82

      (a) —(1)  A national bank shall dispose of OREO at the earliest time that prudent judgment dictates, but not later than the end of the holding period (or an extension thereof) permitted by 12 U.S.C. 29.

      (2)  A Federal savings association may hold OREO for not more than five years after commencement of the holding period. On the request of a Federal savings association, the OCC may extend the holding period for not more than an additional five years.

      (b)  The holding period begins on the date that:

      (1) Ownership of the property is originally transferred to a national bank or Federal savings association, including as a result of a merger with or acquisition of another organization holding OREO;

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association completes relocation from former banking premises to new banking premises or ceases to use the former banking premises without relocating;

      (d)  If a national bank or Federal savings association disposes of OREO, but the real estate subsequently is conveyed back to the institution within five years as a result of a valid rescission or invalidation of the original disposition, then the holding period will be tolled for the period during which the real estate was not in possession of the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (e)  If a national bank or Federal savings association reacquires a property that had been OREO and was disposed of consistent with § 34.83, the holding period will reset.

      § 34.83   Disposition of OREO.

#### § § 34.83

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may dispose of OREO in the following ways:

      (1) With respect to OREO in general:

      (i) By entering into a transaction that is a sale under generally accepted accounting principles;

      (ii) By entering into a transaction that involves a loan guaranteed or insured by the United States government or by an agency of the United States government or a loan eligible for purchase by a Federally-sponsored instrumentality that purchases loans; or

      (iii) By selling the property pursuant to a land contract or a contract for deed;

      (2) With respect to DPC real estate, by retaining the property for its own use as bank premises or by transferring it to a subsidiary or affiliate for use in the business of the subsidiary or affiliate;

      (3) With respect to a lease:

      (i) By obtaining an assignment or a coterminous sublease. If a national bank or Federal savings association enters into a sublease that is not coterminous, the period during which the master lease must be divested will be suspended for the duration of the sublease, and will begin running again upon termination of the sublease. A national bank or Federal savings association holding a lease as OREO may enter into an extension of the lease that would exceed the holding period referred to in § 34.82 if the extension meets the following criteria:

      (A) The extension is necessary in order to sublease the master lease;

      (B) The national bank or Federal savings association, prior to entering into the extension, has a firm commitment from a prospective subtenant to sublease the property; and

      (C) The term of the extension is reasonable and does not materially exceed the term of the sublease;

      (ii) Should the OCC determine that a national bank or Federal savings association has entered into a lease, extension of a lease, or a sublease for the purpose of real estate speculation, the OCC will take appropriate measures to address the violation, which may include requiring the bank or savings association to take immediate steps to divest the lease or sublease; and

      (4) With respect to a transaction that does not qualify as a disposition under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, by receiving or accumulating from the purchaser an amount in a down payment, principal and interest payments, and private mortgage insurance totalling at least 10 percent of the sales price, as measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; or

      (5) By any other method approved by the OCC.

      (b)  A Federal savings association also may transfer OREO to a service corporation. A service corporation may hold real property transferred to it:

      (1) As OREO, subject to the requirements otherwise applicable to the Federal savings association under this subpart E; or

      (2) As an investment in real estate under § 5.59.

      (c)  A national bank or Federal savings association shall make diligent and ongoing efforts to dispose of each parcel of OREO, and shall maintain documentation adequate to reflect those efforts.

      (a)  (1) Upon transfer to OREO, a national bank or Federal savings association shall substantiate the parcel's market value by obtaining either:

      (i) An appraisal in accordance with subpart C of this part; or

      (ii) An appropriate evaluation when the recorded investment amount is equal to or less than the threshold amount in subpart C of this part.

      (2) A national bank or Federal savings association shall develop a prudent real estate collateral evaluation policy that allows the bank or savings association to monitor the value of each parcel of OREO in a manner consistent with prudent banking practice.

      (b)  If a national bank or Federal savings association has a valid appraisal or an appropriate evaluation obtained in connection with a real estate loan and in accordance with subpart C of this part, then the bank or savings association need not obtain another appraisal or evaluation when it acquires ownership of the property.

      (c)  A national bank or Federal savings association need not obtain a new appraisal or evaluation when selling OREO if the sale is consummated based on a valid appraisal or an appropriate evaluation.

      § 34.86   OREO expenditures and notification.

#### § § 34.86

      (a)  A national bank or Federal savings association may pay operating expenses on OREO, including taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance, that are reasonable and consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

      (b)  A national bank or Federal savings association may pay expenses for OREO that includes the operation of a business, provided the expenses are:

      (1) Reasonably calculated to reduce any shortfall between the property's market value and the recorded investment amount; and

      (2) Consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

      (c)  For OREO that is a development or improvement project, a national bank or Federal savings association may make advances to complete the project if the advances are:

      (1) Reasonably calculated to reduce any shortfall between the property's market value and the recorded investment amount;

      (2) Not made for the purpose of speculation in real estate; and

      (3) Consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

      (d)  (1) A national bank or Federal savings association shall notify the appropriate supervisory office at least 30 days before implementing a development or improvement plan for OREO when the sum of the plan's estimated cost and the bank's or savings association's current recorded investment amount (including any unpaid prior liens on the property) exceeds 10 percent of the bank's or savings association's total equity capital on its most recent report of condition. A national bank or Federal savings association need notify the OCC under this paragraph (d)(1) only once.

      (2) The required notification must demonstrate that the additional expenditure is consistent with the conditions and limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) Unless informed otherwise, the national bank or Federal savings association may implement the proposed plan on the thirty-first day (or sooner, if notified by the OCC) following receipt by the OCC of the notification, subject to any conditions imposed by the OCC.

      (b)  The OCC adopts this subpart pursuant to the requirements of section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639h) which provides that a creditor, including a national bank or operating subsidiary, a Federal branch or agency or a Federal savings association or operating subsidiary, may not extend credit in the form of a higher-risk mortgage without complying with the requirements of section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639h) and this subpart G. The definition of a higher-risk mortgage in section 129H is consistent with the definition of a higher-priced mortgage loan under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026. Specifically, 12 CFR 1026.35 defines a higher-priced mortgage loan as a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set:

      (1) By 1.5 or more percentage points, for a loan secured by a first lien with a principal obligation at consummation that does not exceed the limit in effect as of the date the transaction's interest rate is set for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac;

      (2) By 2.5 or more percentage points, for a loan secured by a first lien with a principal obligation at consummation that exceeds the limit in effect as of the date the transaction's interest rate is set for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac; or

      (3) By 3.5 or more percentage points, for a loan secured by a subordinate lien.

      (c)  This subpart applies to higher-priced mortgage loan transactions entered into by national banks and their operating subsidiaries, Federal branches and agencies and Federal savings associations and operating subsidiaries of savings associations.

      (d)  Appendix C to this subpart sets out OCC Interpretations of the requirements imposed by the OCC pursuant to this subpart.

      (2)  A creditor obtains a written appraisal that meets the requirements for an appraisal required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the creditor:

      (i) Orders that the appraiser perform the appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 ), and any implementing regulations in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification;

      (3)  If two appraisals must be obtained under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each appraisal shall meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (4)  One of the two required appraisals must include an analysis of:

      (i) The difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property, as specified in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property from the seller;

      (ii) Changes in market conditions between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property; and

      (iii) Any improvements made to the property between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property.

      (5)  If the creditor must obtain two appraisals under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the creditor may charge the consumer for only one of the appraisals.

      (6) —(i)  A creditor must obtain two written appraisals under paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless the creditor can demonstrate by exercising reasonable diligence that the requirement to obtain two appraisals does not apply. A creditor acts with reasonable diligence if the creditor bases its determination on information contained in written source documents, such as the documents listed in appendix B to this subpart.

      (ii)  If, after exercising reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) are present and therefore must obtain two written appraisals in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, one of the two appraisals shall include an analysis of the factors in paragraph (d)(4) of this section only to the extent that the information necessary for the appraiser to perform the analysis can be determined.

      (7)  The additional appraisal required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply to extensions of credit that finance a consumer's acquisition of property:

      (i) From a local, State or Federal government agency;

      (ii) From a person who acquired title to the property through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedure as a result of the person's exercise of rights as the holder of a defaulted mortgage loan;

      (iii) From a non-profit entity as part of a local, State, or Federal government program under which the non-profit entity is permitted to acquire title to single-family properties for resale from a seller who acquired title to the property through the process of foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedure;

      (iv) From a person who acquired title to the property by inheritance or pursuant to a court order of dissolution of marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership, or of partition of joint or marital assets to which the seller was a party;

      (v) From an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee;

      (vi) From a servicemember, as defined in 50 U.S.C. App. 511(1), who received a deployment or permanent change of station order after the servicemember purchased the property;

      (vii) Located in an area designated by the President as a federal disaster area, if and for as long as the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(6), waive the requirements in title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 ), and any implementing regulations in that area; or

      (viii) Located in a rural county, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).

      (e) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall disclose the following statement, in writing, to a consumer who applies for a higher-priced mortgage loan: “We may order an appraisal to determine the property's value and charge you for this appraisal. We will give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost.” Compliance with the disclosure requirement in Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(2), satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.

      (2)  The disclosure required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application for a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section. In the case of a loan that is not a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section at the time of application, but becomes a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section after application, the disclosure shall be delivered or placed in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section.

      (f) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall provide to the consumer a copy of any written appraisal performed in connection with a higher-priced mortgage loan pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

      (2)  A creditor shall provide to the consumer a copy of each written appraisal pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section:

      (i) No later than three business days prior to consummation of the loan; or

      (ii) In the case of a loan that is not consummated, no later than 30 days after the creditor determines that the loan will not be consummated.

      (3)  Any copy of a written appraisal required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 ).

      (4)  A creditor shall not charge the consumer for a copy of a written appraisal required to be provided to the consumer pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

      (g)  The rules in this section 34.203 were adopted jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board), the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau). These rules are substantively identical to the Board's and the Bureau's higher-priced mortgage loan appraisal rules published separately in 12 CFR 226.43 (for the Board) and 12 CFR 1026.35(a) and (c) (for the Bureau).

L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010)), 12 U.S.C. 3331

      (c)  This subpart applies to States and to appraisal management companies (AMCs) providing appraisal management services in connection with consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling or securitizations of those transactions.

      (d)  Nothing in this subpart should be construed to prevent a State from establishing requirements in addition to those in this subpart. In addition, nothing in this subpart should be construed to alter guidance in, and applicability of, the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines   or other relevant agency guidance that cautions banks, bank holding companies, Federal savings associations, state savings associations, and credit unions, as applicable, that each such entity is accountable for overseeing the activities of third-party service providers and ensuring that any services provided by a third party comply with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance applicable directly to the financial institution.

      § 34.211   Definitions.

#### § § 34.211

      (4) Reviewing and verifying the work of appraisers.

      (e)  means a network, list or roster of licensed or certified appraisers approved by an AMC to perform appraisals as independent contractors for the AMC.

A person regularly extends consumer credit if, in any 12-month period, the person originates more than one credit extension that is subject to the requirements of 12 CFR 1026.32 or one or more such credit extensions through a mortgage broker.

      (j)  means:

      (1) A residential structure that contains one to four units, whether or not that structure is attached to real property. The term includes an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, mobile home, and trailer, if it is used as a residence.

      (k)  means an AMC that is owned and controlled by an insured depository institution, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813 and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      (o)  mean the 50 _States_ and the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

      (p)  (USPAP) means the appraisal standards promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation.

      § 34.212   Appraiser panel—annual size calculation.

      For purposes of determining whether, within a 12-month period, an AMC oversees an appraiser panel of more than 15 State-certified or State-licensed appraisers in a State or 25 or more State-certified or State-licensed appraisers in two or more States pursuant to § 34.211(c)(1)(iii)—

      (1) Sends written notice to the appraiser removing the appraiser from the appraiser panel, with an explanation of its action; or

      (2) Receives written notice from the appraiser asking to be removed from the appraiser panel or notice of the death or incapacity of the appraiser.

      (c) If an appraiser is removed from an AMC's appraiser panel pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, but the AMC subsequently accepts the appraiser for consideration for future assignments or engages the appraiser at any time during the twelve months after the AMC's removal, the removal will be deemed not to have occurred, and the appraiser will be deemed to have been part of the AMC's appraiser panel without interruption.

      (d) The period for purposes of counting appraisers on an AMC's appraiser panel may be the calendar year or a 12-month period established by law or rule of each State with which the AMC is required to register.

#### § § 34.213

      Each State electing to register AMCs pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section must:

    (d)  (1) The examples in this part are not exclusive. Compliance with an example, to the extent applicable, constitutes compliance with this part.

    (2) Examples in a paragraph illustrate only the issue described in the paragraph and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise in this part.

> [66 FR 2084, Jan. 10, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 28400, May 16, 2014; 89 FR 22067, Mar. 29, 2024]

    § 35.2   Definition of covered agreement.

#### § § 35.2

    (a)  A covered agreement is any contract, arrangement, or understanding that meets all of the following criteria—

    (1) The agreement is in writing.

    (2) The parties to the agreement include—

    (i) One or more insured depository institutions or affiliates of an insured depository institution; and

    (ii) One or more NGEPs.

    (3) The agreement provides for the insured depository institution or any affiliate to—

    (i) Provide to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) cash payments, grants, or other consideration (except loans) that have an aggregate value of more than $10,000 in any calendar year; or

    (ii) Make to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) loans that have an aggregate principal amount of more than $50,000 in any calendar year.

    (4) The agreement is made pursuant to, or in connection with, the fulfillment of the CRA, as defined in § 35.4.

    (5) The agreement is with a NGEP that has had a CRA communication as described in § 35.3 prior to entering into the agreement.

    (b) —(1)  A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to make more community development investments in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not reach an agreement concerning the community development investments the institution should make in the community, and the parties do not reach any mutual arrangement or understanding. Two weeks later, the institution unilaterally issues a press release announcing that it has established a general goal of making $100 million of community development grants in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods served by the insured depository institution over the next 5 years. The NGEP is not identified in the press release. The press release is not a written arrangement or understanding.

    (2)  A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to offer new loan programs in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and the insured depository institution reach a mutual arrangement or understanding that the institution will provide additional loans in the NGEP's community. The institution tells the NGEP that it will issue a press release announcing the program. Later, the insured depository institution issues a press release announcing the loan program. The press release incorporates the key terms of the understanding reached between the NGEP and the insured depository institution. The written press release reflects the mutual arrangement or understanding of the NGEP and the insured depository institution and is, therefore, a written arrangement or understanding.

    (3)  An NGEP sends a letter to an insured depository institution requesting that the institution provide a $15,000 grant to the NGEP. The insured depository institution responds in writing and agrees to provide the grant in connection with its annual grant program. The exchange of letters constitutes a written arrangement or understanding.

    (c)  A covered agreement does not include—

    (1) Any individual loan that is secured by real estate; or

    (2) Any specific contract or commitment for a loan or extension of credit to an individual, business, farm, or other entity, or group of such individuals or entities, if—

    (i) The funds are loaned at rates that are not substantially below market rates; and

    (ii) The loan application or other loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to use the borrowed funds to make a loan or extension of credit to one or more third parties.

    (d) —(1)  An insured depository institution provides an organization with a $1 million loan that is documented in writing and is secured by real estate owned or to-be-acquired by the organization. The agreement is an individual mortgage loan and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, regardless of the interest rate on the loan or whether the organization intends or is authorized to re-loan the funds to a third party.

    (2)  An insured depository institution commits to provide a $500,000 line of credit to a small business that is documented by a written agreement. The loan is made at rates that are within the range of rates offered by the institution to similarly situated small businesses in the market and the loan documentation does not indicate that the small business intends or is authorized to re-lend the borrowed funds. The agreement is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (3)  An insured depository institution offers small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). A small business obtains a $75,000 loan, documented in writing, from the institution under the institution's SBA loan program. The loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to re-lend the funds. Although the rate charged on the loan is well below that charged by the institution on commercial loans, the rate is within the range of rates that the institution would charge a similarly situated small business for a similar loan under the SBA loan program. Accordingly, the loan is not made at substantially below market rates and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (4)  A bank holding company enters into a written agreement with a community development organization that provides that insured depository institutions owned by the bank holding company will make $250 million in small business loans in the community over the next 5 years. The written agreement is not a specific contract or commitment for a loan or an extension of credit and, thus, is not exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each small business loan made by the insured depository institution pursuant to this general commitment would, however, be exempt from coverage if the loan is made at rates that are not substantially below market rates and the loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intended or was authorized to re-lend the funds.

    (e)  If an agreement includes a loan, extension of credit or loan commitment that, if documented separately, would be exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, the exempt loan, extension of credit or loan commitment may be excluded for purposes of determining whether the agreement is a covered agreement.

    (f)  For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a multi-year agreement that does not include a schedule for the disbursement of payments, grants, loans or other consideration by the insured depository institution or affiliate, is considered to have a value in the first year of the agreement equal to all payments, grants, loans and other consideration to be provided at any time under the agreement.

    § 35.3   CRA communications.

#### § § 35.3

    (a)  A CRA communication is any of the following—

    (1) Any written or oral comment or testimony provided to a Federal banking agency concerning the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the insured depository institution, any affiliated insured depository institution, or any CRA affiliate.

    (2) Any written comment submitted to the insured depository institution that discusses the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the institution and must be included in the institution's CRA public file.

    (3) Any discussion or other contact with the insured depository institution or any affiliate about—

    (i) Providing (or refraining from providing) written or oral comments or testimony to any Federal banking agency concerning the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the insured depository institution, any affiliated insured depository institution, or any CRA affiliate;

    (ii) Providing (or refraining from providing) written comments to the insured depository institution that concern the adequacy of the institution's performance under the CRA and must be included in the institution's CRA public file; or

    (iii) The adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the insured depository institution, any affiliated insured depository institution, or any CRA affiliate.

    (iii)  A NGEP, such as a civil rights group, community group providing housing and other services in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, veterans organization, community theater group, or youth organization, sends a fundraising letter to insured depository institutions and to other businesses in its community. The letter encourages all businesses in the community to meet their obligation to assist in making the local community a better place to live and work by supporting the fundraising efforts of the NGEP.

    (c) —(1)  A NGEP must file an annual report for a covered agreement for any fiscal year in which the NGEP receives or uses funds or other resources under the agreement.

    (2)  An insured depository institution or affiliate must file an annual report for a covered agreement for any fiscal year in which the institution or affiliate—

    (i) Provides or receives any payments, fees, or loans under the covered agreement that must be reported under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section; or

    (ii) Has data to report on loans, investments, and services provided by a party to the covered agreement under the covered agreement under paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section.

    (d) —(1)  The annual report filed by a NGEP under this section must include the following—

    (i) The name and mailing address of the NGEP filing the report;

    (ii) Information sufficient to identify the covered agreement for which the annual report is being filed, such as by providing the names of the parties to the agreement and the date the agreement was entered into or by providing a copy of the agreement;

    (iii) The amount of funds or resources received under the covered agreement during the fiscal year; and

    (iv) A detailed, itemized list of how any funds or resources received by the NGEP under the covered agreement were used during the fiscal year, including the total amount used for—

    (A) Compensation of officers, directors, and employees;

    (B) Administrative expenses;

    (C) Travel expenses;

    (D) Entertainment expenses;

    (E) Payment of consulting and professional fees; and

    (F) Other expenses and uses (specify expense or use).

    (2) —(i)  If a NGEP allocated and used funds received under a covered agreement for a specific purpose, the NGEP may fulfill the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section with respect to such funds by providing—

    (A) A brief description of each specific purpose for which the funds or other resources were used; and

    (B) The amount of funds or resources used during the fiscal year for each specific purpose.

    (ii)  A NGEP allocates and uses funds for a specific purpose if the NGEP receives and uses the funds for a purpose that is more specific and limited than the categories listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

    (3)  The annual report filed by a NGEP may consist of or incorporate a report prepared for any other purpose, such as the Internal Revenue Service Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax on Form 990, or any other Internal Revenue Service form, state tax form, report to members or shareholders, audited or unaudited financial statements, audit report, or other report, so long as the annual report filed by the NGEP contains all of the information required by this paragraph (d).

    (4)  A NGEP that is a party to 2 or more covered agreements may file with each relevant supervisory agency a single consolidated annual report covering all the covered agreements. Any consolidated report must contain all the information required by this paragraph (d). The information reported under paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) and (d)(2) of this section may be reported on an aggregate basis for all covered agreements.

    (5) —(i)  A NGEP receives an unrestricted grant of $15,000 under a covered agreement, includes the funds in its general operating budget and uses the funds during its fiscal year. The NGEP's annual report for the fiscal year must provide the name and mailing address of the NGEP, information sufficient to identify the covered agreement, and state that the NGEP received $15,000 during the fiscal year. The report must also indicate the total expenditures made by the NGEP during the fiscal year for compensation, administrative expenses, travel expenses, entertainment expenses, consulting and professional fees, and other expenses and uses. The NGEP's annual report may provide this information by submitting an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 that includes the required information.

In addition, since the organization allocated and used the funds for a specific purpose that is more narrow and limited than the categories of expenses included in the detailed, itemized list of expenses, the organization would have the option of providing either the total amount it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, or a statement that it used the $15,000 to purchase computer equipment and a brief description of the equipment purchased.

The group's annual report for the fiscal year must include the name and address of the group, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the group received $50,000. Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for a specific purpose, the group's annual report must provide the total amount of funds it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The group's annual report also could state that it used $5,000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip.

    (iv)  A community development organization is a party to two separate covered agreements with two unaffiliated insured depository institutions. Under each agreement, the organization receives $15,000 during its fiscal year and uses the funds to support its activities during that year. If the organization elects to file a consolidated annual report, the consolidated report must identify the organization and the two covered agreements, state that the organization received $15,000 during the fiscal year under each agreement, and provide the total amount that the organization used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

    (v) A general description of the terms and conditions of any payments, fees, or loans reported under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section, or, in the event such terms and conditions are set forth—

    (A) In the covered agreement, a statement identifying the covered agreement and the date the agreement (or a list identifying the agreement) was filed with the relevant supervisory agency; or

    (B) In a previous annual report filed by the insured depository institution or affiliate, a statement identifying the date the report was filed with the relevant supervisory agency; and

    (vi) The aggregate amount and number of loans, aggregate amount and number of investments, and aggregate amount of services provided under the covered agreement to any individual or entity not a party to the agreement—

    (A) By the insured depository institution or affiliate during its fiscal year; and

    (B) By any other party to the agreement, unless such information is not known to the insured depository institution or affiliate filing the report or such information is or will be contained in the annual report filed by another party under this section.

    (f) —(1)  Each party must file its annual report with each relevant supervisory agency for the covered agreement no later than six months following the end of the fiscal year covered by the report.

    (2)  (i) A NGEP may fulfill the filing requirements of this section by providing the following materials to an insured depository institution or affiliate that is a party to the agreement no later than six months following the end of the NGEP's fiscal year—

    (A) A copy of the NGEP's annual report required under paragraph (d) of this section for the fiscal year; and

    (B) Written instructions that the insured depository institution or affiliate promptly forward the annual report to the relevant supervisory agency or agencies on behalf of the NGEP.

    (ii) An insured depository institution or affiliate that receives an annual report from a NGEP pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section must file the report with the relevant supervisory agency or agencies on behalf of the NGEP within 30 days.

      § 43.4   Standard risk retention.

#### § § 43.4

      (a)  Except as provided in §§ 43.5 through 43.10, the sponsor of a securitization transaction must retain an eligible vertical interest or eligible horizontal residual interest, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      (1) If the sponsor retains only an eligible vertical interest as its required risk retention, the sponsor must retain an eligible vertical interest in a percentage of not less than 5 percent.

      (2) If the sponsor retains only an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the amount of the interest must equal at least 5 percent of the fair value of all ABS interests in the issuing entity issued as a part of the securitization transaction, determined using a fair value measurement framework under GAAP.

      (3) If the sponsor retains both an eligible vertical interest and an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the percentage of the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest and the percentage of the eligible vertical interest must equal at least five.

      (4) The percentage of the eligible vertical interest, eligible horizontal residual interest, or combination thereof retained by the sponsor must be determined as of the closing date of the securitization transaction.

      (b)  In lieu of retaining all or any part of an eligible horizontal residual interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor may, at closing of the securitization transaction, cause to be established and funded, in cash, an eligible horizontal cash reserve account in the amount equal to the fair value of such eligible horizontal residual interest or part thereof, provided that the account meets all of the following conditions:

      (1) The account is held by the trustee (or person performing similar functions) in the name and for the benefit of the issuing entity;

      (2) Amounts in the account are invested only in cash and cash equivalents; and

      (i) Amounts in the account shall be released only to:

      (A) Satisfy payments on ABS interests in the issuing entity on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to satisfy an amount due on any ABS interest; or

      (B) Pay critical expenses of the trust unrelated to credit risk on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to pay such expenses and:

      () Such expenses, in the absence of available funds in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account, would be paid prior to any payments to holders of ABS interests; and

      () Such payments are made to parties that are not affiliated with the sponsor; and

      (ii) Interest (or other earnings) on investments made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be released once received by the account.

      (c)  A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption “Credit Risk Retention”, a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities in the securitization transaction the following disclosures in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (c):

      (1)  With respect to any eligible horizontal residual interest held under paragraph (a) of this section, a sponsor must disclose:

      (i) A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security issued in the same offering of ABS interests,

      (A) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction. If the specific prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization are not available, the sponsor must disclose a range of fair values (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the close of the securitization transaction based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization. A sponsor disclosing a range of fair values based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization must also disclose the method by which it determined any range of prices, tranche sizes, or rates of interest.

      (B) A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor;

      (C) A description of the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair values or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including any portion of the eligible horizontal residual interest retained by the sponsor;

      (D) All key inputs and assumptions or a comprehensive description of such key inputs and assumptions that were used in measuring the estimated total fair value or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor.

      (E) To the extent applicable to the valuation methodology used, the disclosure required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section shall include, but should not be limited to, quantitative information about each of the following:

      () Discount rates;

      () Loss given default (recovery);

      () Prepayment rates;

To the extent the disclosure required in this paragraph (c)(1) includes a description of a curve or curves, the description shall include a description of the methodology that was used to derive each curve and a description of any aspects or features of each curve that could materially impact the fair value calculation or the ability of a prospective investor to evaluate the sponsor's fair value calculation. To the extent a sponsor uses information about the securitized assets in its calculation of fair value, such information shall not be as of a date more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided that for a subsequent issuance of ABS interests by the same issuing entity with the same sponsor for which the securitization transaction distributes amounts to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, such information shall not be as of a date more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided further, that the balance or value (in accordance with the transaction documents) of the securitized assets may be increased or decreased to reflect anticipated additions or removals of assets the sponsor makes or expects to make between the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the asset pool collateralizing such asset-backed security and the closing date of the securitization.

      (A) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest the sponsor retained at the closing of the securitization transaction, based on actual sale prices and finalized tranche sizes;

      (B) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to retain under this section; and

      (C) To the extent the valuation methodology or any of the key inputs and assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value or range of fair values disclosed prior to sale and required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section materially differs from the methodology or key inputs and assumptions used to calculate the fair value at the time of closing, descriptions of those material differences.

      (iii) If the sponsor retains risk through the funding of an eligible horizontal cash reserve account:

      (A) The amount to be placed (or that is placed) by the sponsor in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account at closing, and the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to fund through the eligible horizontal cash reserve account in order for such account, together with other retained interests, to satisfy the sponsor's risk retention requirement;

      (B) A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal cash reserve account; and

      (C) The disclosures required in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (d)  A sponsor must retain the certifications and disclosures required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.

      § 43.5   Revolving pool securitizations.

#### § § 43.5

      (a)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      means an issuing entity that is established to issue on multiple issuance dates more than one series, class, subclass, or tranche of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of securitized assets that will change in composition over time, and that does not monetize excess interest and fees from its securitized assets.

      means an ABS interest or ABS interests:

      (1) Collateralized by the securitized assets and servicing assets owned or held by the issuing entity, other than the following that are not considered a component of seller's interest:

      (i) Servicing assets that have been allocated as collateral only for a specific series in connection with administering the revolving pool securitization, such as a principal accumulation or interest reserve account; and

      (ii) Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and

      (2) That is  with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and

      (3) That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.

      (b)  A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 43.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.

      (c)  In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:

      (1) The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:

      (i) The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and

      (ii) Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 43.4 are permitted to be invested;

      (3) If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;

      (4) The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and

      (i) At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or

      (ii) If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).

      (d)  In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding § 43.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.

      (2) If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.

      (3) If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.

      (f)  The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:

      (1) Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;

      (2) Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 43.4 are permitted to be invested; and

      (3) In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.

      (g)  The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this § 43.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding § 43.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).

      (h)  The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);

      (1) Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;

      (2) The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;

      (3) The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and

      (4) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:

      (i) The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and

      (ii) The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.

      (i)  The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in § 43.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:

      (1) The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;

      (2) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:

      (i) As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and

      (ii) Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:

      (A) The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;

      (B) the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,

      (C) the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.

      (j)  A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this § 43.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:

      (1) The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and

      (2) The dates are no more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors of disclosures required for the interest by paragraph (k) of this section, or for revolving pool securitizations that make distributions to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, no more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors of such disclosures.

      (k) —(1)  A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption “Credit Risk Retention” the following disclosure in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (k):

      (i) A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security, a description of the material terms of the seller's interest, and the percentage of the seller's interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction, measured in accordance with the requirements of this § 43.5, as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests issued, or as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, as required by the terms of the securitization transaction;

      (ii) A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of seller's interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) A description of the material terms of any horizontal residual interests offsetting the seller's interest in accordance with paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section; and

      (iv) Disclosure of the fair value of those horizontal residual interests retained by the sponsor for the series being offered to investors and described in the disclosures, as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests issued, described in the same manner and within the same timeframes required for disclosure of the fair values of eligible horizontal residual interests specified in § 43.4(c).

      (iii) The value of the collateral subject to such first priority security interest or lien, together with other attributes of the obligor (including, without limitation, its general financial condition, ability to generate cash flow available for debt service and other demands for that cash flow), is adequate (in the commercially reasonable judgment of the CLO manager exercised at the time of investment) to repay the loan and to repay all other indebtedness of equal seniority secured by such first priority security interest or lien in or on the same collateral, and the CLO manager certifies, on or prior to each date that it acquires a loan constituting part of a new CLO-eligible tranche, that it has policies and procedures to evaluate the likelihood of repayment of loans acquired by the CLO and it has followed such policies and procedures in evaluating each CLO-eligible loan tranche.

      (b)  A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 43.3 with respect to an open market CLO transaction if:

      (1) The open market CLO does not acquire or hold any assets other than CLO-eligible loan tranches that meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and servicing assets;

      (4) All purchases of CLO-eligible loan tranches and other assets by the open market CLO issuing entity or through a warehouse facility used to accumulate the loans prior to the issuance of the CLO's ABS interests are made in open market transactions on an arms-length basis;

      (c)  To qualify as a CLO-eligible loan tranche, a term loan of a syndicated credit facility to a commercial borrower must have the following features:

      (1) A minimum of 5 percent of the face amount of the CLO-eligible loan tranche is retained by the lead arranger thereof until the earliest of the repayment, maturity, involuntary and unscheduled acceleration, payment default, or bankruptcy default of such CLO-eligible loan tranche, provided that such lead arranger complies with limitations on hedging, transferring and pledging in § 43.12 with respect to the interest retained by the lead arranger.

      (2) Lender voting rights within the credit agreement and any intercreditor or other applicable agreements governing such CLO-eligible loan tranche are defined so as to give holders of the CLO-eligible loan tranche consent rights with respect to, at minimum, any material waivers and amendments of such applicable documents, including but not limited to, adverse changes to the calculation or payments of amounts due to the holders of the CLO-eligible tranche, alterations to  provisions, changes to voting provisions, and waivers of conditions precedent; and

      (3) The pro rata provisions, voting provisions, and similar provisions applicable to the security associated with such CLO-eligible loan tranches under the CLO credit agreement and any intercreditor or other applicable agreements governing such CLO-eligible loan tranches are not materially less advantageous to the holder(s) of such CLO-eligible tranche than the terms of other tranches of comparable seniority in the broader syndicated credit facility.

      § 44.7   Limitations on permitted proprietary trading activities.

#### § § 44.7

      (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 44.4 through 44.6 if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:

      (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

      (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or

      (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      § 44.12   Permitted investment in a covered fund.

#### § § 44.12

      (a)  (1) Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in § 44.10(a) of this subpart, a banking entity may acquire and retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that the banking entity or an affiliate thereof organizes and offers pursuant to § 44.11, for the purposes of:

      (B) Must, no later than 1 year after the date of establishment of the fund (or such longer period as may be provided by the Board pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section), conform its ownership interest in the covered fund to the limits in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;

      (ii)  (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in any covered fund made or held pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not exceed 3 percent of the total number or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund.

      (B) An investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in a c_o_vered fund that is an issuing entity of asset-backed securities may not exceed 3 percent of the total fair market value of the ownership interests of the fund measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless a greater percentage is retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in compliance with the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder, in which case the investment by the banking entity and its affiliates in the covered fund may not exceed the amount, number, or value of ownership interests of the fund required under section 15G of the Exchange Act and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.

      (iii)  The aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired or retained under this section may not exceed 3 percent of the tier 1 capital of the banking entity, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter.

      (ii)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a registered investment company, SEC-regulated business development companies, or foreign public fund as described in § 44.10(c)(1) will not be considered to be an affiliate of the banking entity so long as:

      (A) The banking entity, together with its affiliates, does not own, control, or hold with the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting shares of the company or fund; and

      (B) The banking entity, or an affiliate of the banking entity, provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, administrative, and other services to the company or fund in compliance with the limitations under applicable regulation, order, or other authority.

      (iv)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires an ownership interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the ownership interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4), for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:

      (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment);

      (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment). If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;

      (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (3)  In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section:

      (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or

      (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.

      (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes.

      (iv) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (4) —(i)  If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the “feeder fund”) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the “master fund”), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entity's permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund. The banking entity's permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and

      (ii)  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 44.11 for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a “fund of funds”) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entity's permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the fund that is held through the fund of funds. The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.

      (5)  (i) A banking entity shall not be required to include in the calculation of the investment limits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (ii) A banking entity shall not be restricted under this section in the amount of any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (c)  (1)(i) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 44.10(d)(6)(ii)), on a historical cost basis;

      (ii) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (2)  For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:

      (i)  If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and

      (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:

      (A) In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;

      (B) In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:

      ()  If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier _1_ capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and

      ()  If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders' equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards.

      (iii) —(A)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards.

      (B)  With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.

      (d)  For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entity's tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of:

      (1)(i) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 44.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C of this part), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and

      (ii) The fair market value of the banking entity's ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 44.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C of this part), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.

      (2) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (e) —(1)  Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.

      (i) Be submitted to the Board at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period;

      (ii) Provide the reasons for application, including information that addresses the factors in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; and

      (iii) Explain the banking entity's plan for reducing the permitted investment in a covered fund through redemption, sale, dilution or other methods as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (3)  In reviewing any application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Board may consider all the facts and circumstances related to the permitted investment in a covered fund, including:

      (i) Whether the investment would result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;

      (ii) The contractual terms governing the banking entity's interest in the covered fund;

      (iii) The date on which the covered fund is expected to have attracted sufficient investments from investors unaffiliated with the banking entity to enable the banking entity to comply with the limitations in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;

      (iv) The total exposure of the covered banking entity to the investment and the risks that disposing of, or maintaining, the investment in the covered fund may pose to the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States;

      (v) The cost to the banking entity of divesting or disposing of the investment within the applicable period;

      (vi) Whether the investment or the divestiture or conformance of the investment would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and unaffiliated parties, including clients, customers, or counterparties to which it owes a duty;

      (vii) The banking entity's prior efforts to reduce through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods its ownership interests in the covered fund, including activities related to the marketing of interests in such covered fund;

      (viii) Market conditions; and

      (ix) Any other factor that the Board believes appropriate.

      (4)  The Board may impose such conditions on any extension approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States, address material conflicts of interest or other unsound banking practices, or otherwise further the purposes of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.

      (5)  In the case of a banking entity that is primarily regulated by another Federal banking agency, the SEC, or the CFTC, the Board will consult with such agency prior to acting on an application by the banking entity for an extension under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (A) Reasonably designed written policies and procedures; and

      (B) Internal controls and ongoing monitoring, management, and authorization procedures, including relevant escalation procedures; and

      (ii) The acquisition or retention of the ownership interest:

      (A) Is made in accordance with the written policies, procedures, and internal controls required under this section;

      (B) At the inception of the hedge, is designed to reduce or otherwise significantly mitigate one or more specific, identifiable risks arising:

      () Out of a transaction conducted solely to accommodate a specific customer request with respect to the covered fund; or

      () In connection with the compensation arrangement with the employee that directly provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, or other services to the covered fund;

      (C) Does not give rise, at the inception of the hedge, to any significant new or additional risk that is not itself hedged contemporaneously in accordance with this section; and

      (D) Is subject to continuing review, monitoring and management by the banking entity.

      (iii) With respect to risk-mitigating hedging activity conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the compensation arrangement relates solely to the covered fund in which the banking entity or any affiliate has acquired an ownership interest pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) and such compensation arrangement provides that any losses incurred by the banking entity on such ownership interest will be offset by corresponding decreases in amounts payable under such compensation arrangement.

      (b)  (1) The prohibition contained in § 44.10(a) of this subpart does not apply to the acquisition or retention of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund by a banking entity only if:

      (B) With respect to a banking entity that is not a foreign banking organization, the banking entity is not organized under the laws of the United States or of one or more States and the banking entity, on a fully-consolidated basis, meets at least two of the following requirements:

      () Total assets of the banking entity held outside of the United States exceed total assets of the banking entity held in the United States;

      () Total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity outside of the United States exceed total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity in the United States; or

      (3) An ownership interest in a covered fund is not offered for sale or sold to a resident of the United States for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section only if it is not sold and has not been sold pursuant to an offering that targets residents of the United States in which the banking entity or any affiliate of the banking entity participates. If the banking entity or an affiliate sponsors or serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor to a covered fund, then the banking entity or affiliate will be deemed for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3) to participate in any offer or sale by the covered fund of ownership interests in the covered fund.

      (iii) The investment or sponsorship, including any transaction arising from risk-mitigating hedging related to an ownership interest, is not accounted for as principal directly or indirectly on a consolidated basis by any branch or affiliate that is located in the United States or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State.

      (5) For purposes of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank, or any subsidiary thereof, is located in the United States; however, a foreign bank of which that branch, agency, or subsidiary is a part is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operation of the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (c)  The prohibition contained in § 44.10(a) of this subpart does not apply to the acquisition or retention by an insurance company, or an affiliate thereof, of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund only if:

      (iii) Would not otherwise be a banking entity except by virtue of the acquisition or retention of an ownership interest in, sponsorship of, or relationship with the entity, by another banking entity that meets the following:

      (A) The banking entity is not organized, or directly or indirectly controlled by a banking entity that is organized, under the laws of the United States or of any State; and

      (B) The banking entity's acquisition of an ownership interest in or sponsorship of the fund by the foreign banking entity meets the requirements for permitted covered fund activities and investments solely outside the United States, as provided in § 44.13(b);

      (iv) Is established and operated as part of a bona fide asset management business; and

#### § § 44.14

      (a)  (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 44.11 of this subpart, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 44.11(b) of this subpart, and no affiliate of such entity, may enter into a transaction with the covered fund, or with any other covered fund that is controlled by such covered fund, that would be a covered transaction as defined in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b)(7)), as if such banking entity and the affiliate thereof were a member bank and the covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a banking entity may:

      (i) Acquire and retain any ownership interest in a covered fund in accordance with the requirements of § 44.11, § 44.12, or § 44.13;

      (ii) Enter into any prime brokerage transaction with any covered fund in which a covered fund managed, sponsored, or advised by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof) has taken an ownership interest, if:

      (A) The banking entity is in compliance with each of the limitations set forth in § 44.11 of this subpart with respect to a covered fund organized and offered by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof);

      (B) The chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) of the banking entity certifies in writing annually no later than March 31 to the OCC (with a duty to update the certification if the information in the certification materially changes) that the banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee, assume, or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such covered fund invests; and

      (C) The Board has not determined that such transaction is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation and condition of the banking entity; and

      (iii) Enter into a transaction with a covered fund that would be an exempt covered transaction under 12 U.S.C. 371c(d) or § 223.42 of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42) subject to the limitations specified under 12 U.S.C. 371c(d) or § 223.42 of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42), as applicable,

      (C) The banking entity making each extension of credit meets the requirements of § 223.42(l)(1)(i) and (ii) of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42(l)(1)(i) and(ii)), as if the extension of credit was an intraday extension of credit, regardless of the duration of the extension of credit.

      (3) Any transaction or activity permitted under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (iv) or (v) of this section must comply with the limitations in § 44.15.

      (b)  A banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, or that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 44.11 of this subpart, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 44.11(b) of this subpart, shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1), as if such banking entity were a member bank and such covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      § 44.15   Other limitations on permitted covered fund activities and investments.

#### § § 44.15

      (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 44.11 through 44.13 of this subpart if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:

      (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

      (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or

      (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;

      (2) The banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in Qualifying TruPS Collateral; and

      (3) The banking entity acquired such interest on or before December 10, 2013 (or acquired such interest in connection with a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that acquired the interest on or before December 10, 2013).

      (b) For purposes of this § 44.16,  shall mean any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that, as of the end of any reporting period within 12 months immediately preceding the issuance of such trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument, had total consolidated assets of less than $15,000,000,000 or issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a mutual holding company.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a banking entity may act as a market maker with respect to the interests of an issuer described in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§ 44.4 and 44.11.

      (d) Without limiting the applicability of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board, the FDIC and the OCC will make public a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of paragraph (a). A banking entity may rely on the list published by the Board, the FDIC and the OCC.

      (5) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign banking entity is located in the United States; however, the foreign bank that operates or controls that branch, agency, or subsidiary is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operating or controlling the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (f) —(1)  A banking entity that does not engage in activities or investments pursuant to subpart B or subpart C (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 44.6(a) of subpart B) may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing the required compliance program prior to becoming engaged in such activities or making such investments (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 44.6(a) of subpart B).

      (2)  A banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities may satisfy the requirements of this section by including in its existing compliance policies and procedures appropriate references to the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and adjustments as appropriate given the activities, size, scope, and complexity of the banking entity.

      (g) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a banking entity with limited trading assets and liabilities shall be presumed to be compliant with subpart B and subpart C of this part and shall have no obligation to demonstrate compliance with this part on an ongoing basis.

      (2)  If upon examination or audit, the OCC determines that the banking entity has engaged in proprietary trading or covered fund activities that are otherwise prohibited under subpart B or subpart C of this part, the OCC may require the banking entity to be treated under this part as if it did not have limited trading assets and liabilities. The OCC's rebuttal of the presumption in this paragraph must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC retains its authority to require a banking entity without significant trading assets and liabilities to apply any requirements of this part that would otherwise apply if the banking entity had significant or moderate trading assets and liabilities if the OCC determines that the size or complexity of the banking entity's trading or investment activities, or the risk of evasion of subpart B or subpart C of this part, does not warrant a presumption of compliance under paragraph (g) of this section or treatment as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities, as applicable. The OCC's exercise of this reservation of authority must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (i) —(1)  The OCC will notify the banking entity in writing of any determination requiring notice under this part and will provide an explanation of the determination.

      (2)  The banking entity may respond to any or all items in the notice described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The response should include any matters that the banking entity would have the OCC consider in deciding whether to make the determination. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated OCC official within 30 days after the date on which the banking entity received the notice. The OCC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the OCC, the activities or condition of the banking entity so requires, provided that the banking entity is informed of the time period at the time of notice, or with the consent of the banking entity. In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.

      (3)  Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the OCC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the OCC's determination.

      (4)  The OCC will notify the banking entity of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision.

      § 44.21   Termination of activities or investments; penalties for violations.

#### § § 44.21

      (a) Any banking entity that engages in an activity or makes an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or acts in a manner that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, including through an abuse of any activity or investment permitted under subparts B or C, or otherwise violates the restrictions and requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, shall, upon discovery, promptly terminate the activity and, as relevant, dispose of the investment.

      (b) Whenever the OCC finds reasonable cause to believe any banking entity has engaged in an activity or made an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or engaged in any activity or made any investment that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, the OCC may take any action permitted by law to enforce compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including directing the banking entity to restrict, limit, or terminate any or all activities under this part and dispose of any investment.

This regulation implements section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by defining terms used in the statute and related terms, establishing capital and margin requirements, and explaining the statutes' requirements.

    (c)  This part establishes minimum capital and margin requirements for each covered swap entity subject to this part with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This part applies to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by a covered swap entity on or after the relevant compliance date set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Nothing in this part is intended to prevent a covered swap entity from collecting margin in amounts greater than are required under this part.

    (d) —(1)  The requirements of this part (except for § 45.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared swap if the counterparty:

    (i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(A)) and implementing regulations;

    (ii) Qualifies for an exemption from clearing under a rule, regulation, or order that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued pursuant to its authority under section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1)) concerning cooperative entities that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(1)(A)); or

    (iii) Satisfies the criteria in section 2(h)(7)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(D)) and implementing regulations.

    (2)  The requirements of this part (except for § 45.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared security-based swap if the counterparty:

    (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (f) Once a covered swap entity must comply with the margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with respect to a particular counterparty based on the compliance dates in paragraph (e) of this section, the covered swap entity shall remain subject to the requirements of this part with respect to that counterparty.

    (g)(1) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with that counterparty becomes subject to stricter margin requirements under this part (such as if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user without material swaps exposure to a financial end user with material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity shall comply with the stricter margin requirements for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status.

    (2) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with that counterparty becomes subject to less strict margin requirements under this part (such as if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user with material swaps exposure to a financial end user without material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity may comply with the less strict margin requirements for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status as well as for any outstanding non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into after the applicable compliance date in paragraph (e) of this section and before the counterparty changed its status.

    (h)  Covered swaps entities are required to comply with the requirements of this part for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the relevant compliance dates for variation margin and for initial margin established in paragraph (e) of this section. Any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into before such relevant date shall remain outside the scope of this part if amendments are made to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap by method of adherence to a protocol, other amendment of a contract or confirmation, or execution of a new contract or confirmation in replacement of and immediately upon termination of an existing contract or confirmation, as follows:

    (1) Amendments to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap solely to comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 47, 12 CFR part 252 subpart I, or 12 CFR part 382, as applicable;

    (2) The non-cleared swap or non-cleared security based swap was amended under the following conditions:

    (i) The swap was originally entered into before the relevant compliance date established in paragraph (e) of this section and one party to the swap booked it at, or otherwise held it at, an entity (including a branch or other authorized form of establishment) located in the United Kingdom;

    (ii) The entity in the United Kingdom subsequently arranged to amend the swap, solely for the purpose of transferring it to an affiliate, or a branch or other authorized form of establishment, located in any European Union member state or the United States, in connection with the entity's planning for or response to the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, and the transferee is:

    (A) A covered swap entity, or

    (B) A covered swap entity's counterparty to the swap, and the counterparty represents to the covered swap entity that the counterparty performed the transfer in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section;

    (iii) The law of the European Union ceases to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, without conclusion of a Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union pursuant to Article 50(2);

    (iv) The amendments do not modify any of the following: The payment amount calculation methods, the maturity date, or the notional amount of the swap;

    (v) The amendments cause the transfer to take effect on or after the date of the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section transpires; and

    (iv) The amendments cause the transfer to take effect by the later of:

    (A) The date that is one year after the date of the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii); or

    (B) Such other date permitted by transitional provisions under Article 35 of Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) No. 2016/2251, as amended.

    (3)(i) Amendments to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap that are made solely to accommodate the replacement of:

    (A) An interbank offered rate (IBOR) including, but not limited to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), and the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR);

    (B) Any other interest rate that a covered swap entity reasonably expects to be replaced or discontinued or reasonably determines has lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment; or

    (C) Any other interest rate that succeeds a rate referenced in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. An amendment made under this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(C) could be one of multiple amendments made under this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(C). For example, an amendment could replace an IBOR with a temporary interest rate and later replace the temporary interest rate with a permanent interest rate.

    (ii) Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section may also incorporate spreads or other adjustments to the replacement interest rate and make other necessary technical changes to operationalize the determination of payments or other exchanges of economic value using the replacement interest rate, including changes to determination dates, calculation agents, and payment dates. The changes may not extend the maturity or increase the total effective notional amount of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap beyond what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement.

    (iii) Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section may also be effectuated through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties. Portfolio compression under this paragraph is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (h)(4) of this section but any non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps resulting from the portfolio compression may not have a longer maturity or increase the total effective notional amount more than what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement.

    (4) Amendments solely to reduce risk or remain risk-neutral through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties, as long as any non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps resulting from the portfolio compression do not:

    (i) Exceed the sum of the total effective notional amounts of all of the swaps that were submitted to the compression exercise that had the same or longer remaining maturity as the resulting swap; or

    (ii) Exceed the longest remaining maturity of all the swaps submitted to the compression exercise.

    (5) The non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap was amended solely for one of the following reasons:

    (i) To reflect technical changes, such as addresses, identities of parties for delivery of formal notices, and other administrative or operational provisions as long as they do not alter the non-cleared swap's or non-cleared security-based swap's underlying asset or reference, the remaining maturity, or the total effective notional amount; or

    (ii) To reduce the notional amount, so long as:

    (A) All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully terminated; or

    (B) All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully novated to a third party, who complies with applicable margin rules for the novated portion upon the transfer.

    § 45.3   Initial margin.

#### § § 45.3

    (a)  A covered swap entity shall collect initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap from a counterparty that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure or that is a swap entity in an amount that is no less than the greater of:

    (b)  A covered swap entity shall post initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap to a counterparty that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure. Such initial margin shall be in an amount at least as large as the covered swap entity would be required to collect under paragraph (a) of this section if it were in the place of the counterparty.

    (c)  A covered swap entity shall comply with the initial margin requirements described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on each business day, for a period beginning on or before the business day following the day of execution and ending on the date the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap terminates or expires.

    (d)  A covered swap entity is not required to collect or post initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap described in § 45.1(d). For any other non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap between a covered swap entity and a counterparty that is neither a financial end user with a material swaps exposure nor a swap entity, the covered swap entity shall collect initial margin at such times and in such forms and such amounts (if any), that the covered swap entity determines appropriately addresses the credit risk posed by the counterparty and the risks of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap.

#### § § 45.4

    (a)  After the date on which a covered swap entity enters into a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a swap entity or financial end user, the covered swap entity shall collect variation margin equal to the variation margin amount from the counterparty to such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap when the amount is positive and post variation margin equal to the variation margin amount to the counterparty to such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap when the amount is negative.

    (b)  A covered swap entity shall comply with the variation margin requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section on each business day, for a period beginning on or before the business day following the day of execution and ending on the date the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security based swap terminates or expires.

    (c)  A covered swap entity is not required to collect or post variation margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap described in § 45.1(d). For any other non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap between a covered swap entity and a counterparty that is neither a financial end user nor a swap entity, the covered swap entity shall collect variation margin at such times and in such forms and such amounts (if any), that the covered swap entity determines appropriately addresses the credit risk posed by the counterparty and the risks of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap.

    § 45.5   Netting arrangements, minimum transfer amount, and satisfaction of collecting and posting requirements.

#### § § 45.5

    (a)  (1) For purposes of calculating and complying with the initial margin requirements of § 45.3 using an initial margin model as described in § 45.8, or with the variation margin requirements of § 45.4, a covered swap entity may net non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with this subsection.

    (2) To the extent that one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps are executed pursuant to an eligible master netting agreement between a covered swap entity and its counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user, a covered swap entity may calculate and comply with the applicable requirements of this part on an aggregate net basis with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps governed by such agreement, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

    (3)(i) Except as permitted in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if an eligible master netting agreement covers non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 45.1(e) or (g), all the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps covered by that agreement are subject to the requirements of this part and included in the aggregate netting portfolio for the purposes of calculating and complying with the margin requirements of this part.

    (ii) An eligible master netting agreement may identify one or more separate netting portfolios that independently meet the requirements in paragraph (1) of the definition of “Eligible master netting agreement” in § 45.2 and to which collection and posting of margin applies on an aggregate net basis separate from and exclusive of any other non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by the eligible master netting agreement. Any such netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 45.1(e) or (g) is subject to the requirements of this part. Any such netting portfolio that contains only non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date is not subject to the requirements of this part.

    (4) If a covered swap entity cannot conclude after sufficient legal review with a well-founded basis that the netting agreement described in this section meets the definition of eligible master netting agreement set forth in § 45.2, the covered swap entity must treat the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security based swaps covered by the agreement on a gross basis for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to collect margin, but the covered swap entity may net those non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to post margin.

    (b)  Notwithstanding § 45.3 or § 45.4, a covered swap entity is not required to collect or post margin pursuant to this part with respect to a particular counterparty unless and until the combined amount of initial margin and variation margin that is required pursuant to this part to be collected or posted and that has not yet been collected or posted with respect to the counterparty is greater than $500,000.

    (c)  A covered swap entity shall not be deemed to have violated its obligation to collect or post margin from or to a counterparty under § 45.3, § 45.4, or § 45.6(e) if:

    (1) The counterparty has refused or otherwise failed to provide or accept the required margin to or from the covered swap entity; and

    (2) The covered swap entity has:

    (i) Made the necessary efforts to collect or post the required margin, including the timely initiation and continued pursuit of formal dispute resolution mechanisms, or has otherwise demonstrated upon request to the satisfaction of the OCC that it has made appropriate efforts to collect or post the required margin; or

    (ii) Commenced termination of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with the counterparty promptly following the applicable cure period and notification requirements.

    (1) Prohibits the custodian from rehypothecating, repledging, reusing, or otherwise transferring (through securities lending, securities borrowing, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement or other means) the collateral held by the custodian, except that cash collateral may be held in a general deposit account with the custodian if the funds in the account are used to purchase an asset described in § 45.6(a)(2) or (b), such asset is held in compliance with this § 45.7, and such purchase takes place within a time period reasonably necessary to consummate such purchase after the cash collateral is posted as initial margin; and

    (2) Is a legal, valid, binding, and enforceable agreement under the laws of all relevant jurisdictions, including in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding.

    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a custody agreement may permit the posting party to substitute or direct any reinvestment of posted collateral held by the custodian, provided that, with respect to collateral collected by a covered swap entity pursuant to § 45.3(a) or posted by a covered swap entity pursuant to § 45.3(b), the agreement requires the posting party to:

    (1) Substitute only funds or other property that would qualify as eligible collateral under § 45.6, and for which the amount net of applicable discounts described in appendix B of this part would be sufficient to meet the requirements of § 45.3; and

    (2) Direct reinvestment of funds only in assets that would qualify as eligible collateral under § 45.6, and for which the amount net of applicable discounts described in appendix B of this part would be sufficient to meet the requirements of § 45.3.

    § 45.8   Initial margin models and standardized amounts.

#### § § 45.8

    (a)  Unless a covered swap entity's initial margin model conforms to the requirements of this section, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 45.3 on a daily basis pursuant to appendix A of this part.

    (b)  A covered swap entity may calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 45.3 on a daily basis using an initial margin model only if the initial margin model meets the requirements of this section.

    (c)  (1) A covered swap entity must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before using any initial margin model to calculate the initial margin required in this part.

    (2) A covered swap entity must demonstrate that the initial margin model satisfies all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis.

    (3) A covered swap entity must notify the OCC in writing 60 days prior to:

    (i) Extending the use of an initial margin model that the OCC has approved under this section to an additional product type;

    (ii) Making any change to any initial margin model approved by the OCC under this section that would result in a material change in the covered swap entity's assessment of initial margin requirements; or

    (iii) Making any material change to modeling assumptions used by the initial margin model.

    (4) The OCC may rescind its approval of the use of any initial margin model, in whole or in part, or may impose additional conditions or requirements if the OCC determines, in its sole discretion, that the initial margin model no longer complies with this section.

    (d)  (1) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must calculate an amount of initial margin that is equal to the potential future exposure of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. Potential future exposure is an estimate of the one-tailed 99 percent confidence interval for an increase in the value of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps due to an instantaneous price shock that is equivalent to a movement in all material underlying risk factors, including prices, rates, and spreads, over a holding period equal to the shorter of ten business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio.

    (2) All data used to calibrate the initial margin model must be based on an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year and not more than five years and must incorporate a period of significant financial stress for each broad asset class that is appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.

    (3) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must use risk factors sufficient to measure all material price risks inherent in the transactions for which initial margin is being calculated. The risk categories must include, but should not be limited to, foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. For material exposures in significant currencies and markets, modeling techniques must capture spread and basis risk and must incorporate a sufficient number of segments of the yield curve to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.

    (4) In the case of a non-cleared cross-currency swap, the covered swap entity's initial margin model need not recognize any risks or risk factors associated with the fixed, physically-settled foreign exchange transaction associated with the exchange of principal embedded in the non-cleared cross-currency swap. The initial margin model must recognize all material risks and risk factors associated with all other payments and cash flows that occur during the life of the non-cleared cross-currency swap.

    (5) The initial margin model may calculate initial margin for a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap or a netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. It may reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and other hedging benefits for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that are governed by the same eligible master netting agreement by incorporating empirical correlations within the following broad risk categories, provided the covered swap entity validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for modeling and measuring hedging benefits: Commodity, credit, equity, and foreign exchange or interest rate. Empirical correlations under an eligible master netting agreement may be recognized by the initial margin model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.

    (6) If the initial margin model does not explicitly reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and hedging benefits between subsets of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category, the covered swap entity must calculate an amount of initial margin separately for each subset within which such relationships are explicitly recognized by the initial margin model. The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each subset of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty for the portfolio of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within the broad risk category.

    (7) The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty.

    (8) The initial margin model may not permit the calculation of any initial margin collection amount to be offset by, or otherwise take into account, any initial margin that may be owed or otherwise payable by the covered swap entity to the counterparty.

    (9) The initial margin model must include all material risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of option positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.

    (10) The covered swap entity may not omit any risk factor from the calculation of its initial margin that the covered swap entity uses in its initial margin model unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the OCC that such omission is appropriate.

    (11) The covered swap entity may not incorporate any proxy or approximation used to capture the risks of the covered swap entity's non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the OCC that such proxy or approximation is appropriate.

    (12) The covered swap entity must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal margin model to ensure continued applicability and relevance.

    (13) The covered swap entity must review and, as necessary, revise the data used to calibrate the initial margin model at least annually, and more frequently as market conditions warrant, to ensure that the data incorporate a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.

    (14) The level of sophistication of the initial margin model must be commensurate with the complexity of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it is applied. In calculating an initial margin collection amount, the initial margin model may make use of any of the generally accepted approaches for modeling the risk of a single instrument or portfolio of instruments.

    (15) The OCC may in its sole discretion require a covered swap entity using an initial margin model to collect a greater amount of initial margin than that determined by the covered swap entity's initial margin model if the OCC determines that the additional collateral is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the covered swap entity's transaction(s), or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction(s).

    (e)  A covered swap entity must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its initial margin model in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance the initial margin model as appropriate to ensure that the initial margin model continues to meet the requirements for approval in this section.

    (f)  (1) The covered swap entity must maintain a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.

    (2) The covered swap entity's risk control unit must validate its initial margin model prior to implementation and on an ongoing basis. The covered swap entity's validation process must be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the initial margin model, or the validation process must be subject to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. The validation process must include:

    (i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the initial margin model;

    (ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking by comparing the covered swap entity's initial margin model outputs (estimation of initial margin) with relevant alternative internal and external data sources or estimation techniques. The benchmark(s) must address the chosen model's limitations. When applicable, the covered swap entity should consider benchmarks that allow for non-normal distributions such as historical and Monte Carlo simulations. When applicable, validation shall include benchmarking against observable margin standards to ensure that the initial margin required is not less than what a derivatives clearing organization or a clearing agency would require for similar cleared transactions; and

    (iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting the initial margin model. This analysis must recognize and compensate for the challenges inherent in back-testing over periods that do not contain significant financial stress.

    (3) If the validation process reveals any material problems with the initial margin model, the covered swap entity must promptly notify the OCC of the problems, describe to the OCC any remedial actions being taken, and adjust the initial margin model to ensure an appropriately conservative amount of required initial margin is being calculated.

    (4) The covered swap entity must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management and the risk control unit that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the covered swap entity's initial margin model measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the covered swap entity's initial margin requirements under this part. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the covered swap entity's board of directors or a committee thereof.

    (g)  The covered swap entity must adequately document all material aspects of its initial margin model, including the management and valuation of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it applies, the control, oversight, and validation of the initial margin model, any review processes and the results of such processes.

    (h)  The covered swap entity must adequately document internal authorization procedures, including escalation procedures, that require review and approval of any change to the initial margin calculation under the initial margin model, demonstrable analysis that any basis for any such change is consistent with the requirements of this section, and independent review of such demonstrable analysis and approval.

    § 45.9   Cross-border application of margin requirements.

#### § § 45.9

    (a)  The requirements of §§ 45.3 through 45.8 and §§ 45.10 through 45.12 shall not apply to any foreign non-cleared swap or foreign non-cleared security-based swap of a foreign covered swap entity.

    (b) For purposes of this section, a  or  is any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with respect to which neither the counterparty to the foreign covered swap entity nor any party that provides a guarantee of either party's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is:

    (1) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (including a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States;

    (2) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State; or

    (3) An entity that is a subsidiary of an entity that is organized under the laws of the United States or any State.

    (d) —(1)  For non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into by covered swap entities described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a covered swap entity may satisfy the provisions of this part by complying with the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that the prudential regulators jointly, conditionally or unconditionally, determine by public order satisfy the corresponding requirements of §§ 45.3 through 45.8 and §§ 45.10 through 45.12.

    (2)  In determining whether to make a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the prudential regulators will consider whether the requirements of such foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps applicable to such covered swap entities are comparable to the otherwise applicable requirements of this part and appropriate for the safe and sound operation of the covered swap entity, taking into account the risks associated with non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps.

    (3)  A covered swap entity may rely on a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if:

    (i) The covered swap entity's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

    (A) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (other than a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States; or

    (4)  A covered swap entity satisfies its requirement to post initial margin under § 45.3(b) by posting to its counterparty initial margin in the form and amount, and at such times, that its counterparty is required to collect pursuant to a foreign regulatory framework, provided that the counterparty is subject to the foreign regulatory framework and the prudential regulators have made a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless otherwise stated in that determination, and the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

    (i) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (including a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States; or

    (ii) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State.

    (iv) Any other descriptions and documentation that the prudential regulators determine are appropriate.

    (2) A covered swap entity described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may make a request under this section only if the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap activities of the covered swap entity are directly supervised by the authorities administering the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps.

    (f)  Sections 45.3(b) and 45.7 do not apply to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by:

    (1) A foreign branch of a covered swap entity that is a depository institution; or

    (2) A covered swap entity that is not organized under the laws of the United States or any State and is a subsidiary of a depository institution, Edge corporation, or agreement corporation, if:

    (i) Inherent limitations in the legal or operational infrastructure in the foreign jurisdiction make it impracticable for the covered swap entity and the counterparty to post any form of eligible initial margin collateral recognized pursuant to § 45.6(b) in compliance with the segregation requirements of § 45.7;

    (ii) The covered swap entity is subject to foreign regulatory restrictions that require the covered swap entity to transact in the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with the counterparty through an establishment within the foreign jurisdiction and do not accommodate the posting of collateral for the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap outside the jurisdiction;

    (iii) The counterparty to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is not, and the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

    (v) The OCC provides the covered swap entity with prior written approval for the covered swap entity's reliance on this paragraph (f) for the foreign jurisdiction.

    (g)  means an arrangement pursuant to which one party to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap has rights of recourse against a third-party guarantor, with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. For these purposes, a party to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap has rights of recourse against a guarantor if the party has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from the guarantor with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. In addition, any arrangement pursuant to which the guarantor has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from any other third party guarantor with respect to the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap, such arrangement will be deemed a guarantee of the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap by the other guarantor.

    (h)(1) A covered swap entity described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section is not subject to the requirements of § 45.3(a) or § 45.11(a) for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap executed with an affiliate of the covered swap entity; and

    (2) For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, “affiliate” has the same meaning provided in § 45.11(d).

    § 45.11   Special rules for affiliates.

#### § § 45.11

    (a)(1) A covered swap entity shall calculate on each business day an initial margin collection amount for each counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity.

    (2) If the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not exceed 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital, the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 45.3(a) do not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.

    (3) On each business day that the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital:

    (i) The covered swap entity shall collect initial margin under § 45.3(a) for each additional non-cleared swap and non-cleared security-based swap executed that business day with a counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity, commencing on the day after execution and continuing on a daily basis as required under § 45.3(c), until the earlier of:

    (A) The termination date of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap, or

    (B) The business day on which the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under § 45.11(a)(1) falls below 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital;

    (ii) Notwithstanding § 45.7(b), to the extent the covered swap entity collects initial margin pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section in the form of collateral other than cash collateral, the custodian for such collateral may be the covered swap entity or an affiliate of the covered swap entity;

    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (a), “tier 1 capital” means the sum of common equity tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 3.20(b) and additional tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 3.20(c), as reported in the institution's most recent Consolidated Reports of Income and Condition (Call Report); and

    (5) If any subsidiary of the covered swap entity (including a subsidiary described in § 45.9(h)) executes any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with any counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity:

    (i) The covered swap entity shall treat such non-cleared swap or security-based swap as its own for purposes of this paragraph (a); and

    (ii) If the subsidiary is itself a covered swap entity, the compliance by its parent covered swap entity with this paragraph (a)(5) shall be deemed to establish the subsidiary's compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (a) and to exempt the subsidiary from the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 45.3(a) from an affiliate.

    (b) The requirement for a covered swap entity to post initial margin under § 45.3(b) does not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.

    (c) Section 45.3(d) shall apply to a counterparty that is an affiliate in the same manner as it applies to any counterparty that is neither a financial end user without a material swap exposure nor a swap entity.

    (d) For purposes of this section:

    (1) An  means:

    (i) An affiliate as defined in § 45.2; or

    (ii) Any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the covered swap entity through the direct or indirect exercise of controlling influence over the management or policies of the controlled company.

    (a)  A covered institution must publish a summary of the results of its stress test in the period starting June 15 and ending July 15 of the reporting year, provided:

    (1) Unless the OCC determines otherwise, if the $50 billion or over covered institution is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company subject to supervisory stress tests conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to 12 CFR part 252, then within the June 15 to July 15 period such covered institution may not publish the required summary of its annual stress test earlier than the date that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes the supervisory stress test results of the covered bank's parent holding company.

    (2) If the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes the supervisory stress test results of the covered institution's parent holding company prior to June 15, then such covered institution may publish its stress test results prior to June 15, but no later than July 15, through actual publication by the covered institution or through publication by the parent holding company pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b)  The summary required under this section may be published on the covered institution's Web site or in any other forum that is reasonably accessible to the public. A covered institution controlled by a bank holding company that is required to conduct a company-run stress test under applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will be deemed to have satisfied the publication requirement of this section when the bank holding company publicly discloses summary results of its stress test in satisfaction of the requirements of applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, unless the OCC determines that the disclosures at the holding company level do not adequately capture the potential impact of the scenarios on the capital of the covered institution.

    (c)  The information disclosed shall, at a minimum, include—

    (1) A description of the types of risks included in the stress test under this part;

    (2) A summary description of the methodologies used in the stress test;

    (d)  (1) The disclosure of the estimates of aggregate losses, pre-provision net revenue, provisions for credit losses, net income, and pro forma capital ratios (including regulatory and any other capital ratios specified by the OCC), as required by paragraph (b) of this section, must reflect the estimated cumulative effects, as well as the estimated capital ratios, at the end of the planning horizon for the severely adverse scenario.

    (2) With respect to the capital ratio disclosure required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the disclosure must also include the value at the beginning of the planning horizon, and the minimum over the planning horizon of the estimated quarter-end values of each ratio.

      § 50.31   Determining maturity.

#### § § 50.31

      (a) For purposes of calculating its liquidity coverage ratio and the components thereof under this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association shall assume an asset or transaction matures:

      (1) With respect to an instrument or transaction subject to § 50.32, on the earliest possible contractual maturity date or the earliest possible date the transaction could occur, taking into account any option that could accelerate the maturity date or the date of the transaction, except that when considering the earliest possible contractual maturity date or the earliest possible date the transaction could occur, the national bank or Federal savings association should exclude any contingent options that are triggered only by regulatory actions or changes in law or regulation, as follows:

      (i) If an investor or funds provider has an option that would reduce the maturity, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the investor or funds provider will exercise the option at the earliest possible date;

      (ii) If an investor or funds provider has an option that would extend the maturity, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the investor or funds provider will not exercise the option to extend the maturity;

      (iii) If the national bank or Federal savings association has an option that would reduce the maturity of an obligation, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the national bank or Federal savings association will exercise the option at the earliest possible date, except if either of the following criteria are satisfied, in which case the maturity of the obligation for purposes of this part will be the original maturity date at issuance:

      (A) The original maturity of the obligation is greater than one year and the option does not go into effect for a period of 180 days following the issuance of the instrument; or

      (B) The counterparty is a sovereign entity, a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise, or a public sector entity.

      (iv) If the national bank or Federal savings association has an option that would extend the maturity of an obligation it issued, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume the national bank or Federal savings association will not exercise that option to extend the maturity; and

      (v) If an option is subject to a contractually defined notice period, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the earliest possible contractual maturity date regardless of the notice period.

      (2) With respect to an instrument or transaction subject to § 50.33, on the latest possible contractual maturity date or the latest possible date the transaction could occur, taking into account any option that could extend the maturity date or the date of the transaction, except that when considering the latest possible contractual maturity date or the latest possible date the transaction could occur, the national bank or Federal savings association may exclude any contingent options that are triggered only by regulatory actions or changes in law or regulation, as follows:

      (i) If the borrower has an option that would extend the maturity, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the borrower will exercise the option to extend the maturity to the latest possible date;

      (ii) If the borrower has an option that would reduce the maturity, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the borrower will not exercise the option to reduce the maturity;

      (iii) If the national bank or Federal savings association has an option that would reduce the maturity of an instrument or transaction, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume the national bank or Federal savings association will not exercise the option to reduce the maturity;

      (iv) If the national bank or Federal savings association has an option that would extend the maturity of an instrument or transaction, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume the national bank or Federal savings association will exercise the option to extend the maturity to the latest possible date; and

      (v) If an option is subject to a contractually defined notice period, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the latest possible contractual maturity date based on the borrower using the entire notice period.

      (3) With respect to a transaction subject to § 50.33(f)(1)(iii) through (vii) (secured lending transactions) or § 50.33(f)(2)(ii) through (x) (asset exchanges), to the extent the transaction is secured by collateral that has been pledged in connection with either a secured funding transaction or asset exchange that has a remaining maturity of 30 calendar days or less as of the calculation date, the maturity date is the later of the maturity date determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the secured lending transaction or asset exchange or the maturity date determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the secured funding transaction or asset exchange for which the collateral has been pledged.

      (4) With respect to a transaction that has an open maturity, is not an operational deposit, and is subject to the provisions of § 50.32(h)(2), (h)(5), (j), or (k) or § 50.33(d) or (f), the maturity date is the first calendar day after the calculation date. Any other transaction that has an open maturity and is subject to the provisions of § 50.32 shall be considered to mature within 30 calendar days of the calculation date.

      (5) With respect to a transaction subject to the provisions of § 50.33(g), on the date of the next scheduled calculation of the amount required under applicable legal requirements for the protection of customer assets with respect to each broker-dealer segregated account, in accordance with the national bank's or Federal savings association's normal frequency of recalculating such requirements.

      (b)  A national bank's or Federal savings association's derivatives RSF amount equals the sum of:

      (1)  The national bank's or Federal savings association's NSFR derivatives asset amount, as calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, multiplied by an RSF factor of 100 percent;

      (2)  The carrying value of variation margin provided by the national bank or Federal savings association under each derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and each QMNA netting set, to the extent the variation margin reduces the national bank's or Federal savings association's derivatives liability value under the derivative transaction or QMNA netting set, as calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, multiplied by an RSF factor of zero percent;

      (3)  The carrying value of variation margin provided by the national bank or Federal savings association under each derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and each QMNA netting set in excess of the amount described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each derivative transaction or QMNA netting set, multiplied by the RSF factor assigned to each asset comprising the variation margin pursuant to § 50.106;

      (ii) For purposes of paragraph (5)(i) of this section, the gross derivative value of a derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement or of a QMNA netting set is equal to the value to the national bank or Federal savings association, calculated as if no variation margin had been exchanged and no settlement payments had been made based on changes in the value of the derivative transaction or QMNA netting set.

      (6)  The fair value of a national bank's or Federal savings association's contribution to a central counterparty's mutualized loss sharing arrangement (regardless of whether the contribution is included on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet), multiplied by an RSF factor of 85 percent; and

      (2) A national bank's or Federal savings association's NSFR derivatives liability amount is the greater of:

      (i) Zero; and

      (ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's total derivatives liability amount, as calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, less the national bank's or Federal savings association's total derivatives asset amount, as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (e)  (1) A national bank's or Federal savings association's total derivatives asset amount is the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's derivatives asset values, as calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for each derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and each QMNA netting set.

      (2) A national bank's or Federal savings association's total derivatives liability amount is the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's derivatives liability values, as calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for each derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and each QMNA netting set.

      (f)  For each derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and each QMNA netting set:

      (1) The derivatives asset value is equal to the asset value to the national bank or Federal savings association, after taking into account:

      (i) Any variation margin received by the national bank or Federal savings association that is in the form of cash and meets the following conditions:

      (A) The variation margin is not segregated;

      (B) The variation margin is received in connection with a derivative transaction that is governed by a QMNA or other contract between the counterparties to the derivative transaction, which stipulates that the counterparties agree to settle any payment obligations on a net basis, taking into account any variation margin received or provided;

      (C) The variation margin is calculated and transferred on a daily basis based on mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract; and

      (D) The variation margin is in a currency specified as an acceptable currency to settle obligations in the relevant governing contract; and

      (ii) Any variation margin received by the national bank or Federal savings association that is in the form of level 1 liquid assets and meets the conditions of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section provided the national bank or Federal savings association retains the right to rehypothecate the asset for the duration of time that the asset is posted as variation margin to the national bank or Federal savings association; or

      (2) The derivatives liability value is equal to the liability value of the national bank or Federal savings association, after taking into account any variation margin provided by the national bank or Federal savings association.

      (b)  To the extent the Covered Federal Reserve Facility Funding is secured by securities, debt obligations, or other instruments issued by the national bank or Federal savings association or one of its consolidated subsidiaries, the Covered Federal Reserve Facility Funding and assets securing the Covered Federal Reserve Facility Funding are not subject to paragraph (a) of this section and the available stable funding amount and required stable funding amount must be included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's net stable funding ratio calculated under § 50.100(b).

      § 50.109   Rules for consolidation.

#### § § 50.109

      (a)  For available stable funding of a legal entity that is a consolidated subsidiary of a national bank or Federal savings association, including a consolidated subsidiary organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the national bank or Federal savings association may include the available stable funding of the consolidated subsidiary in its ASF amount up to:

#### § § 51.1

    (a)  This part sets out procedures for receiverships of national banks conducted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under the receivership provisions of the National Bank Act (NBA). These receivership provisions apply to national banks that are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

    (b)  This part applies to the appointment of a receiver for uninsured national banks (uninsured banks) and the operation of a receivership after appointment of a receiver for an uninsured bank under 12 U.S.C. 191.

#### § § 51.2

    (a)  The Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller) may appoint any person, including the OCC or another government agency, as receiver for an uninsured bank. The receiver performs its duties under the direction of the Comptroller and serves at the will of the Comptroller. The Comptroller may require the receiver to post a bond or other security. The receiver, with the approval of the Comptroller, may employ such staff and enter into contracts for professional services as are necessary to carry out the receivership.

    (b)  The Comptroller may appoint a receiver for an uninsured bank based on any of the grounds specified in 12 U.S.C. 191(a).

    (c)  If the Comptroller appoints a receiver for an uninsured bank, the bank may seek judicial review of the appointment as provided in 12 U.S.C. 191(b).

    § 51.3   Notice of appointment of receiver.

#### § § 51.3

    Upon appointment of a receiver for an uninsured bank, the OCC will provide notice to the public of the receivership, including by publication in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive months. The notice of the receivership will provide instructions for creditors and other claimants seeking to submit claims with the receiver for the uninsured bank.

    § 51.4   Claims.

#### § § 51.4

    (a)  (1) Persons who have claims against the receivership for an uninsured bank may present such claims, along with supporting documentation, for consideration by the OCC. The OCC will determine the validity and approve the amounts of such claims.

    (2) The OCC will establish a date by which any person seeking to present a claim against the uninsured bank for consideration by the OCC must present their claim for determination. The deadline for filing such claims will not be less than 30 days after the end of the three-month notice period in § 51.3.

    (3) The OCC will allow any claim against the uninsured bank received on or before the deadline for presenting claims if such claim is established to the OCC's satisfaction by the information on the uninsured bank's books and records or otherwise submitted. The OCC may disallow any portion of any claim by a creditor or claim of a security, preference, set-off, or priority which is not established to the satisfaction of the OCC.

    (b)  Persons with claims against an uninsured bank in receivership may present their claims to a court of competent jurisdiction for adjudication. Such persons must submit a copy of any final judgment received from the court to the OCC, to participate in ratable dividends along with other proved claims.

    (c)  If a person with a claim against an uninsured bank in receivership also has an obligation owed to the bank, the claim and obligation will be set off against each other and only the net balance remaining after set-off shall be considered as a claim, provided such set-off is otherwise legally valid.

    § 51.5   Order of priorities.

#### § § 51.5

    The OCC will pay receivership expenses and proved claims against the uninsured bank in receivership in the following order of priority:

    (a) Administrative expenses of the receiver;

    (b) Unsecured creditors of the uninsured bank, including secured creditors to the extent their claim exceeds their valid and enforceable security interest;

    (c) Creditors of the uninsured bank, if any, whose claims are subordinated to general creditor claims; and

    (d) Shareholders of the uninsured bank.

    § 51.6   Administrative expenses of receiver.

#### § § 51.6

    (a)  All administrative expenses of the receiver for an uninsured bank shall be paid out of the assets of the bank in receivership before payment of claims against the receivership.

    (b)  Administrative expenses of the receiver for an uninsured bank include those expenses incurred by the receiver in maintaining banking operations during the receivership, to preserve assets of the uninsured bank, while liquidating or otherwise resolving the affairs of the uninsured bank. Such expenses include pre-receivership and post-receivership obligations that the receiver determines are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the orderly liquidation or other resolution of the uninsured bank in receivership.

    (c)  Administrative expenses for the receiver of an uninsured bank include:

    (1) Salaries, costs, and other expenses of the receiver and its staff, and costs of contracts entered into by the receiver for professional services relating to performing receivership duties; and

    (2) Expenses necessary for the operation of the uninsured bank, including wages and salaries of employees, expenses for professional services, contractual rent pursuant to an existing lease or rental agreement, and payments to third-party or affiliated service providers, that in the opinion of the receiver are of benefit to the receivership, until the date the receiver repudiates, terminates, cancels, or otherwise discontinues the applicable contract.

    § 51.7   Powers and duties of receiver; disposition of fiduciary and custodial accounts.

#### § § 51.7

    (a)  In resolving the affairs of an uninsured bank in receivership, the receiver:

    (1) Takes possession of the books, records and other property and assets of the uninsured bank, including the value of collateral pledged by the uninsured bank to the extent it exceeds valid and enforceable security interests of a claimant;

    (2) Collects all debts, dues and claims belonging to the uninsured bank, including claims remaining after set-off;

    (3) Sells or compromises all bad or doubtful debts, subject to approval by a court of competent jurisdiction;

    (4) Sells the real and personal property of the uninsured bank, subject to approval by a court of competent jurisdiction, on such terms as the court shall direct; and

    (5) Deposits all receivership funds collected from the liquidation of the uninsured bank in an account designated by the OCC.

    (b)  The receiver for an uninsured bank closes the bank's fiduciary and custodial appointments and accounts or transfers some or all of such accounts to successor fiduciaries and custodians, in accordance with 12 CFR 9.16, and other applicable Federal law.

    (c)  The receiver for an uninsured bank may exercise other rights, privileges, and powers authorized for receivers of national banks under the NBA and the common law of receiverships as applied by the courts to receiverships of national banks conducted under the NBA.

    (d)  The receiver for an uninsured bank shall make periodic reports to the OCC on the status and proceedings of the receivership.

    (e)  (1) The Comptroller may remove and replace the receiver for an uninsured bank if, in the Comptroller's discretion, the receiver is not conducting the receivership in accordance with applicable Federal laws or regulations or fails to comply with decisions of the Comptroller with respect to the conduct of the receivership or claims against the receivership.

    (2) The Comptroller may reduce the fees of the receiver for an uninsured bank if, in the Comptroller's discretion, the Comptroller finds the performance of the receiver to be deficient, or the fees of the receiver to be excessive, unreasonable, or beyond the scope of the work assigned to the receiver.

    § 51.8   Payment of claims and dividends to shareholders.

#### § § 51.8

    (a)  (1) After the administrative expenses of the receivership have been paid, the OCC shall make ratable dividends from time to time of available receivership funds according to the priority described in § 51.5, based on the claims that have been proved to the OCC's satisfaction or adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction.

    (2) Dividend payments to creditors and other claimants of an uninsured bank will be made solely from receivership funds, if any, paid to the OCC by the receiver after payment of the expenses of the receiver.

    (b)  Assets held by an uninsured bank in a fiduciary or custodial capacity, as designated on the bank's books and records, will not be considered as part of the bank's general assets and liabilities held in connection with its other business, and will not be considered a source for payment of unrelated claims of creditors and other claimants.

    (c)  The payment of dividends, if any, under paragraph (a) of this section, on proved or adjudicated claims will be made periodically, at the discretion of the OCC, as the receiver liquidates the assets of the uninsured bank.

    (d)  After all administrative expenses of the receiver and proved claims of creditors of the uninsured bank have been paid in full, to the extent there are receivership assets to make such payments, any remaining proceeds shall be paid to the shareholders, or their legal representatives, in proportion to their stock ownership.

    § 51.9   Termination of receivership.

#### § § 51.9

    If there are assets remaining after full payment of the expenses of the receiver and all claims of creditors for an uninsured bank and all fiduciary accounts of the bank have been closed or transferred to a successor fiduciary and fiduciary powers surrendered, the Comptroller shall call a meeting of the shareholders of the uninsured bank, as provided in 12 U.S.C. 197, for the shareholders to decide the manner in which the liquidation will continue. The liquidation may continue by:

    (a) Continuing the receivership of the uninsured bank under the direction of the Comptroller; or

    (i) Governance (including incorporation, bylaws, boards of directors, shareholders, members, and distribution of dividends);

    (ii) Consolidation, merger, dissolution, conversion (including conversion to a stock bank or to another charter), conservatorship, and receivership;

    (iii) Provisions of law applicable only to Federal mutual savings associations;

#### § § 101.5

    (a)  A covered savings association shall divest, conform, or discontinue a nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity at the earliest time that prudent judgment dictates but not later than two years after the effective date of the election. The OCC may require a covered savings association to submit a plan to divest, conform, or discontinue a nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity.

    (b)  The OCC may grant a covered savings association extensions of not more than two years each up to a maximum of eight years if the OCC determines that:

    (1) The covered savings association has made a good faith effort to divest, conform, or discontinue the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity;

    (2) Divestiture, conformance, or discontinuation would have a material adverse financial effect on the covered savings association; and

    (3) Retention or continuation of the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity is consistent with the safe and sound operation of the covered savings association.

    § 101.7   Reelection.

#### § § 101.7

    (a)  A Federal savings association that has terminated its election to operate as a covered savings association may submit a notice to reelect to operate as a covered savings association, if at least five years have elapsed since the effective date of the termination. Upon determining that good cause exists, the OCC may permit a Federal savings association to reelect to operate as a covered savings association prior to the expiration of the five-year period.

    (b)  A Federal savings association reelecting to operate as a covered savings association shall comply with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of this part as if it were making an election for the first time.

    § 101.8   Evasion.

#### § § 101.8

    The OCC may disapprove any notice submitted pursuant to this part if the OCC determines that the notice is made for the purpose of evading § 101.5, including as that section applies to a covered savings association terminating an election.

    (c) No savings association shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because such employee or applicant has opposed any employment practice made unlawful by Federal, state, or local law or regulation or because he has in good faith made a charge of such practice or testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing of such practice by any lawfully constituted authority.

    § 128.9   Guidelines relating to nondiscrimination in lending.

#### § § 128.9

    (a)  Fair housing and equal opportunity in home financing is a policy of the United States established by Federal statutes and Presidential orders and proclamations. In furtherance of the Federal civil rights laws and the economical home financing purposes of the statutes administered by the OCC, the OCC has adopted, in part 128 of this chapter, nondiscrimination regulations that, among other things, prohibit arbitrary refusals to consider loan applications on the basis of the age or location of a dwelling, and prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status (having one or more children under the age of 18), marital status, age (provided the person has the capacity to contract), or national origin in fixing the amount, interest rate, duration, application procedures, collection or enforcement procedures, or other terms or conditions of housing related loans. Such discrimination is also prohibited in the purchase of loans and securities. This section provides supplementary guidelines to aid savings associations in developing and implementing nondiscriminatory lending policies. Each savings association should reexamine its underwriting standards at least annually in order to ensure equal opportunity.

    (b)  The basic purpose of the nondiscrimination regulations is to require that every applicant be given an equal opportunity to obtain a loan. Each loan applicant's creditworthiness should be evaluated on an individual basis without reference to presumed characteristics of a group. The use of lending standards which have no economic basis and which are discriminatory in effect is a violation of law even in the absence of an actual intent to discriminate. However, a standard which has a discriminatory effect is not necessarily improper if its use achieves a genuine business need which cannot be achieved by means which are not discriminatory in effect or less discriminatory in effect.

    (c) —(1)  The Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the National Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending on the basis of sex. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, in addition to this prohibition, forbids discrimination on the basis of marital status. Refusing to lend to, requiring higher standards of creditworthiness of, or imposing different requirements on, members of one sex or individuals of one marital status, is discrimination based on sex or marital status. Loan underwriting decisions must be based on an applicant's credit history and present and reasonably foreseeable economic prospects, rather than on the basis of assumptions regarding comparative differences in creditworthiness between married and unmarried individuals, or between men and women.

    (2)  Requiring fluency in the English language as a prerequisite for obtaining a loan may be a discriminatory practice based on national origin.

    (3)  A practice of discounting all or part of either spouse's income where spouses apply jointly is a violation of section 527 of the National Housing Act. As with other income, when spouses apply jointly for a loan, the determination as to whether a spouse's income qualifies for credit purposes should depend upon a reasonable evaluation of his or her past, present, and reasonably foreseeable economic circumstances. Information relating to child-bearing intentions of a couple or an individual may not be requested.

    (4)  Lending standards which consider as effective only the non-overtime income of the primary wage-earner may result in discrimination because they do not take account of variations in employment patterns among individuals and families. The favored method of loan underwriting reasonably evaluates the credit worthiness of each applicant based on a realistic appraisal of his or her own past, present, and foreseeable economic circumstances. The determination as to whether primary income or additional income qualifies as effective for credit purposes should depend upon whether such income may reasonably be expected to continue through the early period of the mortgage risk. Automatically discounting other income from bonuses, overtime, or part-time employment, will cause some applicants to be denied financing without a realistic analysis of their credit worthiness. Since statistics show that minority group members and low- and moderate-income families rely more often on such supplemental income, the practice may be racially discriminatory in effect, as well as artificially restrictive of opportunities for home financing.

    (5)  Loan decisions should be based upon a realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors respecting an individual's creditworthiness, without giving undue weight to any one factor. The savings association should, among other things, take into consideration that:

    (i) In some instances, past credit difficulties may have resulted from discriminatory practices;

    (ii) A policy favoring applicants who previously owned homes may perpetuate prior discrimination;

    (iii) A current, stable earnings record may be the most reliable indicator of credit-worthiness, and entitled to more weight than factors such as educational level attained;

    (iv) Job or residential changes may indicate upward mobility; and

    (v) Preferring applicants who have done business with the lender can perpetuate previous discriminatory policies.

    (6)  Refusing to lend or lending on less favorable terms in particular areas because of their racial composition is unlawful. Refusing to lend, or offering less favorable terms (such as interest rate, downpayment, or maturity) to applicants because of the income level in an area can discriminate against minority group persons.

    (7)  Sections 128.2, 128.11, and 128.3 of this chapter prohibit loan denials based upon the age or location of a dwelling. These restrictions are intended to prohibit use of unfounded or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic characteristics of an area. Loan decisions should be based on the present market value of the property offered as security (including consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower) and the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value over the term of the loan. Specific factors which may negatively affect its short-range future value (up to 3-5 years) should be clearly documented. Factors which in some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings may not affect the market value of a property because of rehabilitation programs or affirmative lending programs, or because the cause of abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper underwriting considerations include the condition and utility of the improvements, and various physical factors such as street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreation areas, availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposure to flooding and land faults. However, arbitrary decisions based on age or location are prohibited, since many older, soundly constructed homes provide housing opportunities which may be precluded by an arbitrary lending policy.

    (8)  Savings associations must comply with all regulations promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement the Fair Housing Act, found at 24 CFR parts 100 through 125, except that they shall use the Equal Housing Lender logo and poster prescribed by OCC regulations at 12 CFR 128.4 and 128.5 rather than the Equal Housing Opportunity logo and poster required by 24 CFR part 110.

    (d)  Savings associations should review their advertising and marketing practices to ensure that their services are available without discrimination to the community they serve. Discrimination in lending is not limited to loan decisions and underwriting standards; a savings association does not meet its obligations to the community or implement its equal lending responsibility if its marketing practices and business relationships with developers and real estate brokers improperly restrict its clientele to segments of the community. A review of marketing practices could begin with an examination of an association's loan portfolio and applications to ascertain whether, in view of the demographic characteristics and credit demands of the community in which the institution is located, it is adequately serving the community on a nondiscriminatory basis. The OCC will systematically review marketing practices where evidence of discrimination in lending is discovered.

    § 128.10   Supplementary guidelines.

#### § § 128.10

    The policy statement found at 12 CFR 128.9 supplements this part and should be read together with this part. Refer also to the HUD Fair Housing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100 through 125, Federal Reserve Regulation B at 12 CFR part 202, and Federal Reserve Regulation C at 12 CFR part 203.

    § 128.11   Nondiscriminatory appraisal and underwriting.

#### § § 128.11

    (a)  No savings association may use or rely upon an appraisal of a dwelling which the savings association knows, or reasonably should know, is discriminatory on the basis of the age or location of the dwelling, or is discriminatory per se or in effect under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

    (b)  Each savings association shall have clearly written, non-discriminatory loan underwriting standards, available to the public upon request, at each of its offices. Each association shall, at least annually, review its standards, and business practices implementing them, to ensure equal opportunity in lending.

The materials shall be sent within:

    (i) Fourteen days,

    (ii) Ten days if the communication is in connection with the annual meeting, or

    (iii) Three days, if the communication is in connection with a special meeting, after the Federal savings association receives the request for communication.

    (i) Impugns character, integrity, or personal reputation,

    (ii) Makes charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct, or

        (b)  Instead of an annual audit, you may adopt a continuous audit system. Under a continuous audit system, you must arrange for a discrete audit of each significant fiduciary activity ( on an activity-by-activity basis) at an interval commensurate with the nature and risk of that activity. Some fiduciary activities may receive audits at intervals greater or less than one year, as appropriate.

#### § § 150.450

#### § § 150.470

        Your fiduciary audit committee directs the conduct of the audit. Your fiduciary audit committee may consist of a committee of your directors or an audit committee of an affiliate. There are two restrictions on who may serve on the committee:

        (a) Your officers and officers of an affiliate who participate significantly in administering your fiduciary activities may not serve on the audit committee.

        (b) A majority of the members of the audit committee may not serve on any committee to which the board of directors has delegated power to manage and control your fiduciary activities.

        § 150.480   How do I report the results of the audit?

#### § § 150.480

        (a)  If you conduct an annual audit, you must note the results of the audit (including significant actions taken as a result of the audit) in the minutes of the board of directors.

        (b)  If you adopt a continuous audit system, you must note the results of all discrete audits conducted since the last audit report (including significant actions taken as a result of the audits) in the minutes of the board of directors at least once during each calendar year.

      (2) You may establish or utilize an office in any state to perform activities that are ancillary to your fiduciary business.

      § 150.135   How do I determine which state's laws apply to my operations?

#### § § 150.135

      (a) The state laws that apply to you by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) are the laws of the states in which you conduct fiduciary activities. For each individual state, you may conduct fiduciary activities in the capacity of trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or in any other fiduciary capacity the state permits for its state banks, trust companies, or other corporations that compete with Federal savings associations in the state.

      (b) For each fiduciary relationship, the state referred to in 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) is the state in which you conduct fiduciary activities for that relationship.

      § 150.136   To what extent do state laws apply to my fiduciary operations?

#### § § 150.136

      (a)  To enhance safety and soundness and to enable Federal savings associations to conduct their fiduciary activities in accordance with the best practices of thrift institutions in the United States (by efficiently delivering fiduciary services to the public free from undue regulatory duplication and burden), the OCC intends to give Federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their fiduciary powers in accordance with a uniform scheme of Federal regulation. Accordingly, Federal savings associations may exercise fiduciary powers as authorized under Federal law, including this part, without regard to state laws that purport to regulate or otherwise affect their fiduciary activities, except to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) (state laws regarding scope of fiduciary powers, access to examination reports regarding trust activities, deposits of securities, oaths and affidavits, and capital) or in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this section, “state law” includes any state statute, regulation, ruling, order, or judicial decision.

      (b)  Examples of state laws that are preempted by the HOLA and this section include those regarding:

      (1) Registration and licensing;

      (2) Recordkeeping;

      (3) Advertising and marketing;

      (4) The ability of a Federal savings association conducting fiduciary activities to maintain an action or proceeding in state court; and

      (5) Fiduciary-related fees.

      (c)  State laws of the following types are not preempted to the extent that they only incidentally affect the fiduciary operations of Federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) Contract and commercial law;

      (2) Real property law;

      (3) Tort law;

    include loans for personal, family, or household purposes and loans reasonably incident thereto, and may be made as either open-end or closed-end consumer credit (as defined at 12 CFR 226.2(a)(10) and (20)). _Consumer loans_ do not include credit extended in connection with credit card loans, bona fide overdraft loans, and other loans that the savings association has designated as made under investment or lending authority other than section 5(c)(2)(D) of the HOLA.

    is any card, plate, coupon book, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.

    is a credit account established in conjunction with the issuance of, or the extension of credit through, a credit card. This term includes loans made to consolidate credit card debt, including credit card debt held by other lenders, and participation certificates, securities and similar instruments secured by credit card receivables.

    for purposes of this part, is a loan for which the savings association substantially relies upon a security interest in real estate given by the borrower as a condition of making the loan. A loan is made on the security of real estate if:

    (1) The security property is real estate pursuant to the law of the state in which the property is located;

    (2) The security interest of the Federal savings association may be enforced as a real estate mortgage or its equivalent pursuant to the law of the state in which the property is located;

    (3) The security property is capable of separate appraisal; and

    (4) With regard to a security property that is a leasehold or other interest for a period of years, the term of the interest extends, or is subject to extension or renewal at the option of the Federal savings association for a term of at least five years following the maturity of the loan.

    includes a small business concern or entity as defined by section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632(a), and implemented by the regulations of the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR part 121.

    § 160.31   Election regarding categorization of loans or investments and related calculations.

#### § § 160.31

    (a) If a loan or other investment is authorized under more than one section of the HOLA, as amended, or this part, a Federal savings association may designate under which section the loan or investment has been made. Such a loan or investment may be apportioned among appropriate categories, and may be moved, in whole or part, from one category to another. A loan commitment shall be counted as an investment and included in total assets of a Federal savings association for purposes of calculating compliance with HOLA section 5(c)'s investment limitations only to the extent that funds have been advanced and not repaid pursuant to the commitment.

    (b) Loans or portions of loans sold to a third party shall be included in the calculation of a percentage-of-assets or percentage-of-capital investment limitation only to the extent they are sold with recourse.

    (c) A Federal savings association may make a loan secured by an assignment of loans to the extent that it could, under applicable law and regulations, make or purchase the underlying assigned loans.

    § 160.32   Pass-through investments.

#### § § 160.32

    (a) A Federal savings association (“you”) may make pass-through investments. A pass-through investment occurs when you invest in an entity (“company”) that engages only in activities that you may conduct directly and the investment meets the requirements of this section. If an investment is authorized under both this section and some other provision of law, you may designate under which authority or authorities the investment is made. When making a pass-through investment, you must comply with all the statutes and regulations that would apply if you were engaging in the activity directly. For example, your proportionate share of the company's assets will be aggregated with the assets you hold directly in calculating investment limits ( no more than 400% of total capital may be invested in nonresidential real property loans).

    (b) Your pass-through investments are subject to the requirements and filing procedures of 12 CFR 5.58.

    § 160.33   Late charges.

#### § § 160.33

    A Federal savings association may include in a home loan contract a provision authorizing the imposition of a late charge with respect to the payment of any delinquent periodic payment. With respect to any loan made after July 31, 1976, on the security of a home occupied or to be occupied by the borrower, no late charge, regardless of form, shall be assessed or collected by a Federal savings association, unless any billing, coupon, or notice the Federal savings association may provide regarding installment payments due on the loan discloses the date after which the charge may be assessed. A Federal savings association may not impose a late charge more than one time for late payment of the same installment, and any installment payment made by the borrower shall be applied to the longest outstanding installment due. A Federal savings association shall not assess a late charge as to any payment received by it within fifteen days after the due date of such payment. No form of such late charge permitted by this paragraph shall be considered as interest to the Federal savings association and the Federal savings association shall not deduct late charges from the regular periodic installment payments on the loan, but must collect them as such from the borrower.

    § 160.34   Prepayments.

#### § § 160.34

    Any prepayment on a real estate loan must be applied directly to reduce the principal balance on the loan unless the loan contract or the borrower specifies otherwise. Subject to the terms of the loan contract, a Federal savings association may impose a fee for any prepayment of a loan.

    § 160.35   Adjustments to home loans.

#### § § 160.35

    (a) For any home loan secured by borrower-occupied property, or property to be occupied by the borrower, adjustments to the interest rate, payment, balance, or term to maturity must comply with the limitations of this section and the disclosure and notice requirements of 560.210 until superseding regulations are issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

    (b) Adjustments to the interest rate shall correspond directly to the movement of an index satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A Federal savings association also may increase the interest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that specifies the amount of the increase, the time at which it may be made, and which is set forth in the loan contract. A Federal savings association may decrease the interest rate at any time.

    (c) Adjustments to the payment and the loan balance that do not reflect an interest-rate adjustment may be made if:

    (1) The adjustments reflect a change in an index that may be used pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;

    (2) In the case of a payment adjustment, the adjustment reflects a change in the loan balance or is made pursuant to a formula, or to a schedule specifying the percentage or dollar change in the payment as set forth in the loan contract; or

    (3) In the case of an open-end line-of-credit loan, the adjustment reflects an advance taken by the borrower under the line-of-credit and is permitted by the loan contract.

    (d)(1) Any index used must be readily available and independently verifiable. If set forth in the loan contract, an association may use any combination of indices, a moving average of index values, or more than one index during the term of a loan.

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, any index used must be a national or regional index.

    (3) A Federal savings association may use an index not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section 30 days after filing a notice unless, within that 30-day period, the OCC has notified the association that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises significant issues of law or policy. If the OCC provides such notice to the Federal savings association, the Federal savings association may not use that index unless it applies for and receives the OCC's prior written approval.

    § 160.36   De minimis investments.

#### § § 160.36

    A Federal savings association may invest in the aggregate up to the greater of 1% of its total capital or $250,000 in community development investments of the type permitted for a national bank under 12 CFR part 24.

    § 160.40   Commercial paper and corporate debt securities.

#### § § 160.40

    Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(2)(D), a Federal savings association may invest in, sell, or hold commercial paper and corporate debt securities subject to the provisions of this section.

    (a)  (1) Commercial paper must be:

    (i) Investment grade as of the date of purchase; or

    (ii) Guaranteed by a company having outstanding paper that meets the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

    (2) Corporate debt securities must be:

    (i) Securities that may be sold with reasonable promptness at a price that corresponds reasonably to their fair value; and

    (ii) Investment grade.

    (3) A Federal savings association's total investment in the commercial paper and corporate debt securities of any one issuer, or issued by any one person or entity affiliated with such issuer, together with other loans, shall not exceed the general lending limitations contained in § 32.3(a) of this chapter.

    (4) Investments in corporate debt securities convertible into stock are subject to the following additional limitations:

    (i) The purchase of securities convertible into stock at the option of the issuer is prohibited;

    (ii) At the time of purchase, the cost of such securities must be written down to an amount that represents the investment value of the securities considered independently of the conversion feature; and

    (iii) Federal savings associations are prohibited from exercising the conversion feature.

    (5) A Federal savings association shall maintain information in its files adequate to demonstrate that it has exercised prudent judgment in making investments under this section.

    (b) Notwithstanding the limitations contained in this section, the OCC may permit investment in corporate debt securities of another savings association in connection with the purchase or sale of a branch office or in connection with a supervisory merger or acquisition.

    (c)  Before committing to acquire any investment security, a Federal savings association must determine whether the investment is safe and sound and suitable for the association. The Federal savings association must consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit, liquidity, price, transaction, and other risks associated with the investment activity. The Federal savings association must also determine that the issuer has adequate resources and the willingness to provide for all required payments on its obligations in a timely manner.

> [76 FR 49030, Aug. 9, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 35258, June 13, 2012; 77 FR 37283, June 21, 2012]

    § 160.41   Leasing.

#### § § 160.41

    (a)  Subject to the limitations of this section, a Federal savings association may engage in leasing activities. These activities include becoming the legal or beneficial owner of tangible personal property or real property for the purpose of leasing such property, obtaining an assignment of a lessor's interest in a lease of such property, and incurring obligations incidental to its position as the legal or beneficial owner and lessor of the leased property.

    (b)  For the purposes of this section:

    (1) The term  means a lease under which the Federal savings association will not, directly or indirectly, provide or be obligated to provide for:

    (i) The servicing, repair or maintenance of the leased property during the lease term;

    (ii) The purchasing of parts and accessories for the leased property, except that improvements and additions to the leased property may be leased to the lessee upon its request in accordance with the full-payout requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;

    (iii) The loan of replacement or substitute property while the leased property is being serviced;

    (iv) The purchasing of insurance for the lessee, except where the lessee has failed to discharge a contractual obligation to purchase or maintain insurance; or

    (v) The renewal of any license, registration, or filing for the property unless such action by the Federal savings association is necessary to protect its interest as an owner or financier of the property.

    (2) The term  means a lease transaction in which any unguaranteed portion of the estimated residual value relied on by the association to yield the return of its full investment in the leased property, plus the estimated cost of financing the property over the term of the lease, does not exceed 25% of the original cost of the property to the lessor. In general, a lease will qualify as a _full-payout lease_ if the scheduled payments provide at least 75% of the principal and interest payments that a lessor would receive if the finance lease were structured as a market-rate loan.

    (3) The term  means that a Federal savings association that enters into a lease financing transaction must reasonably expect to realize the return of its full investment in the leased property, plus the estimated cost of financing the property over the term of the lease from:

    (i) Rentals;

    (ii) Estimated tax benefits, if any; and

    (iii) The estimated residual value of the property at the expiration of the term of the lease.

    (c) —(1)  A Federal savings association may exercise its authority under HOLA sections 5(c)(1)(B) (residential real estate loans), 5(c)(2)(A) (commercial, business, corporate or agricultural loans), 5(c)(2)(B) (nonresidential real estate loans), and 5(c)(2)(D) (consumer loans) by conducting leasing activities that are the functional equivalent of loans made under those HOLA sections. These activities are commonly referred to as financing leases. Such financing leases are subject to the same investment limits that apply to loans made under those sections. For example, a financing lease of tangible personal property made to a natural person for personal, family or household purposes is subject to all limitations applicable to the amount of a Federal savings association's investment in consumer loans. A financing lease made for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural purposes is subject to all limitations applicable to the amount of a Federal savings association's investment in commercial loans. A financing lease of residential or nonresidential real property is subject to all limitations applicable to the amount of a Federal savings association's investment in these types of real estate loans.

    (2)  To qualify as the functional equivalent of a loan:

    (i) The lease must be a net, full-payout lease representing a non-cancelable obligation of the lessee, notwithstanding the possible early termination of the lease;

    (ii) The portion of the estimated residual value of the property relied upon by the lessor to satisfy the requirements of a full-payout lease must be reasonable in light of the nature of the leased property and all relevant circumstances so that realization of the lessor's full investment plus the cost of financing the property depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the lessee, and not on the residual market value of the leased property; and

    (iii) At the termination of a financing lease, either by expiration or default, property acquired must be liquidated or released on a net basis as soon as practicable. Any property held in anticipation of re-leasing must be reevaluated and recorded at the lower of fair market value or book value.

    (d)  Pursuant to section 5(c)(2)(C) of the HOLA, a Federal savings association may invest in tangible personal property, including vehicles, manufactured homes, machinery, equipment, or furniture, for the purpose of leasing that property. In contrast to financing leases, lease investments made under this authority need not be the functional equivalent of loans.

    (e)  If, in good faith, a Federal savings association believes that there has been an unanticipated change in conditions that threatens its financial position by significantly increasing its exposure to loss, it may:

    (1) As the owner and lessor, take reasonable and appropriate action to salvage or protect the value of the property or its interest arising under the lease;

    (2) As the assignee of a lessor's interest in a lease, become the owner and lessor of the leased property pursuant to its contractual right, or take any reasonable and appropriate action to salvage or protect the value of the property or its interest arising under the lease; or

    (3) Include any provisions in a lease, or make any additional agreements, to protect its financial position or investment in the circumstances set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

    § 160.42   State and local government obligations.

#### § § 160.42

    (a) Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(1)(H), a Federal savings association may invest in obligations issued by any state, territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof (“governmental entity”), subject to appropriate underwriting and the following conditions:

    (b)  means a county, city, town, or other municipal corporation, a public authority, or a publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or a municipal corporation.

    (c)  A  is an obligation that is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a state or political subdivision that has the power to tax. Indirect payments, such as through a special fund, may qualify as _general obligation_s if a state or political subdivision with taxing authority has unconditionally agreed to provide funds to cover payments.

    (d) For all securities, the institution must consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit, liquidity, price, transaction, and other risks associated with the investment activity and determine that such investment is appropriate for the institution. The institution must also determine that the obligor has adequate resources and willingness to provide for all required payments on its obligations in a timely manner.

    § 160.43   Foreign assistance investments.

#### § § 160.43

    Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(4)(C), a Federal savings association may make foreign assistance investments in an aggregate amount not to exceed one percent of its assets, subject to the following conditions:

    (a) For any investment made under the Foreign Assistance Act, the loan agreement shall specify what constitutes an event of default, and provide that upon default in payment of principal or interest under such agreement, the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness thereunder shall become immediately due and payable, at the lender's option. Additionally, the contract of guarantee shall cover 100% of any loss of investment thereunder, except for any portion of the loan arising out of fraud or misrepresentation for which the party seeking payment is responsible, and provide that the guarantor shall pay for any such loss in U.S. dollars within a specified reasonable time after the date of application for payment.

    § 160.60   Suretyship and guaranty.

#### § § 160.60

    Pursuant to section 5(b)(2) of the HOLA, a Federal savings association may enter into a repayable suretyship or guaranty agreement, subject to the conditions in this section.

    (a)  Under a suretyship, a Federal savings association is bound with its principal to pay or perform an obligation to a third person. Under a guaranty agreement, a Federal savings association agrees to satisfy the obligation of the principal only if the principal fails to pay or perform.

    (b)  A Federal savings association may enter into a suretyship or guaranty agreement under this section, subject to each of the following requirements:

    (1) The Federal savings association must limit its obligations under the agreement to a fixed dollar amount and a specified duration.

    (2) The Federal savings association's performance under the agreement must create an authorized loan or other investment.

    (3) The Federal savings association must treat its obligation under the agreement as a loan to the principal for purposes of 12 CFR 31.2 and part 32 of this chapter.

    (4) The Federal savings association must take and maintain a perfected security interest in collateral sufficient to cover its total obligation under the agreement.

    (c)  (1) The Federal savings association must take and maintain a perfected security interest in real estate or marketable securities equal to at least 110 percent of its obligation under the agreement, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (i) If the collateral is real estate, the Federal savings association must establish the value by a signed appraisal or evaluation in accordance with part 34, subpart C of this chapter. In determining the value of the collateral, the Federal savings association must factor in the value of any existing senior mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the property, except those held by the principal to the suretyship or guaranty agreement.

    (ii) If the collateral is marketable securities, the Federal savings association must be authorized to invest in that security taken as collateral. The Federal savings association must ensure that the value of the security is 110 percent of the obligation at all times during the term of agreement.

    (2) The Federal savings association may take and maintain a perfected security interest in collateral which is at all times equal to at least 100 percent of its obligation, if the collateral is:

    (i) Cash;

    (ii) Obligations of the United States or its agencies;

    (iii) Obligations fully guarantied by the United States or its agencies as to principal and interest; or

    (iv) Notes, drafts, or bills of exchange or bankers' acceptances that are eligible for rediscount or purchase by a Federal Reserve Bank.

#### § § 160.100

    This section, and § 160.101 of this subpart, issued pursuant to section 304 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, 12 U.S.C. 1828(o), prescribe standards for real estate lending to be used by Federal savings associations and all their includable subsidiaries, as defined in 12 CFR 3.22(a)(8)(iv) over which the savings associations exercise control, in adopting internal real estate lending policies.

> [76 FR 49030, Aug. 9, 2011, as amended at 79 FR 11313, Feb. 28, 2014; 84 FR 56376, Oct. 22, 2019]

    § 160.101   Real estate lending standards.

#### § § 160.101

    (a) Each Federal savings association shall adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or interests in real estate, or that are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate.

    (b)(1) Real estate lending policies adopted pursuant to this section must:

    (i) Be consistent with safe and sound banking practices;

    (ii) Be appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its operations; and

    (iii) Be reviewed and approved by the savings association's board of directors at least annually.

    (2) The lending policies must establish:

    (i) Loan portfolio diversification standards;

    (ii) Prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits, that are clear and measurable;

    (iii) Loan administration procedures for the savings association's real estate portfolio; and

    (iv) Documentation, approval, and reporting requirements to monitor compliance with the savings association's real estate lending policies.

    (c) Each Federal savings association must monitor conditions in the real estate market in its lending area to ensure that its real estate lending policies continue to be appropriate for current market conditions.

    (d) The real estate lending policies adopted pursuant to this section should reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies established by the Federal bank and thrift supervisory agencies.

    § 160.110   Most favored lender usury preemption for all savings associations.

#### § § 160.110

    (a)  The term “interest” as used in 12 U.S.C. 1463(g) includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.

    (b)  A savings association located in a state may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a Federal savings association making such loans is subject only to the provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a Federal savings association may lawfully charge the highest rate permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of loans made by small loan companies. State supervisors determine the degree to which state-chartered savings associations must comply with state laws other than those imposing restrictions on interest, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c)  The Federal definition of the term “interest” in paragraph (a) of this section does not change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law. For example, if late fees are not “interest” under state law where a savings association is located but state law permits its most favored lender to charge late fees, then a savings association located in that state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The savings association may also charge late fees to its interstate customers because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest and an allowable charge under state law where the savings association is located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that lending institutions may charge under those limitations.

    (d)  Interest on a loan that is permissible under 12 U.S.C. 1463(g)(1) shall not be affected by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the loan.

    § 160.121   Investment in state housing corporations.

#### § § 160.121

    (a) Any Federal savings association to the extent it has legal authority to do so, may make investments in, commitments to invest in, loans to, or commitments to lend to any state housing corporation; provided, that such obligations or loans are secured directly, or indirectly through a fiduciary, by a first lien on improved real estate which is insured under the National Housing Act, as amended, and that in the event of default, the holder of such obligations or loans has the right directly, or indirectly through a fiduciary, to subject to the satisfaction of such obligations or loans the real estate described in the first lien, or the insurance proceeds.

    (b) Any Federal savings association that is adequately capitalized may, to the extent it has legal authority to do so, invest in obligations (including loans) of, or issued by, any state housing corporation incorporated in the state in which such savings association has its home or a branch office; provided (except with respect to loans), that:

    (1) The obligations are investment grade; or

    (2) The obligations are approved by the OCC. The aggregate outstanding direct investment in obligations under paragraph (b) of this section shall not exceed the amount of the Federal savings association's total capital.

    (c) Each state housing corporation in which a savings association invests under the authority of paragraph (b) of this section shall agree, before accepting any such investment (including any loan or loan commitment), to make available at any time to the OCC such information as the OCC may consider to be necessary to ensure that investments are properly made under this section.

#### § § 160.170

    (a) Ensure that the institution can make an informed lending decision and can assess risk on an ongoing basis;

    (b) Identify the purpose and all sources of repayment for each loan, and assess the ability of the borrower(s) and any guarantor(s) to repay the indebtedness in a timely manner;

    (c) Ensure that any claims against a borrower, guarantor, security holders, and collateral are legally enforceable;

    (d) Demonstrate appropriate administration and monitoring of its loans; and

    (e) Take into account the size and complexity of its loans.

Such application and instructions may be obtained from the appropriate Federal banking agency.

      (d)  No application for approval of the issuance of mutual capital certificates pursuant to this section may be filed unless the amendment to the mutual association's charter, constitution or bylaws or other actions conferring such authority shall have been approved pursuant to the procedures and requirements set forth in the mutual association's charter, constitution or bylaws, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law.

      (e)  The application for issuance of mutual capital certificates shall be publicly filed with the appropriate Federal banking agency.

      (f)  No application or approval of the issuance of mutual capital certificates pursuant to this section shall be approved if, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the policies, condition, or operation of the applicant afford a basis for supervisory objection to the application.

      (g)  Following the date of the approval of the application by the appropriate Federal banking agency, the association shall have an offering period of not more than one year in which to complete the sale of the mutual capital certificates issued pursuant to this section.

      (v) Not be redeemable, except: where the dollar weighted average term of each issue of mutual capital certificates to be redeemed is seven years or more and redemption is to be made pursuant to a redemption schedule; in the event of a merger, consolidation or reorganization approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency; or where the funds for redemption are raised by the issuance of mutual capital certificates approved pursuant to this section, or in conjunction with the issuance of capital stock pursuant to part 192 of this chapter:  that mandatory redemption shall not be required; that mutual capital certificates shall not be redeemable on the demand or at the option of the holder; and that mutual capital certificates shall not receive, benefit from, be credited with or otherwise be entitled to or due payments in or for redemption if such payments would cause the association to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements under 12 CFR part 3 if a Federal savings association, or 12 CFR part 324 or part 390, subpart Z, as applicable, if a state savings association;  for the purposes of this paragraph (i)(2)(v), the “dollar weighted average term” of an issue of mutual capital certificates shall be the sum of the products calculated for each year that the mutual capital certificates in the issue have been redeemed or are scheduled to be redeemed. Each product shall be calculated by multiplying the number of years of each mutual capital certificate of a given term by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total dollar amount of each mutual capital certificate in the issue with the same term and the denominator of which shall be the total dollar amount of mutual capital certificates in the entire issue;

      (vi) Not have preemptive rights;

      (vii) Not have voting rights, except that an association may provide for voting rights if:

      (A) The savings association fails to pay dividends for a minimum of three consecutive dividend periods, and then the holders of the class or classes of mutual capital certificates granted such voting rights, and voting as a single class, with one vote for each outstanding certificate, may elect by a majority vote a maximum of one-third of the association's board of directors, the directors so elected to serve until the next annual meeting of the association succeeding the payment of all current and past dividends;

      (B) Any merger, consolidation, or reorganization (except in a supervisory case) is sought to be authorized, where the issuing association is not the survivor, provided that the regulatory capital of the resulting association available for payment of any class of mutual capital certificate on liquidation is less than the regulatory capital available for such class prior to the merger, consolidation, or reorganization;

      (C) Action is sought to be authorized which would create any class of mutual capital certificates having a preference or priority over an outstanding class or classes of mutual capital certificates;

      (D) Any action is sought to be authorized which would adversely change the specific terms of any class of mutual capital certificates;

      (E) Action is sought to be authorized which would increase the number of a class of mutual capital certificates, or the number of a class of mutual capital certificates ranking prior to or on parity with another class of mutual capital certificates; or

      (F) Action is sought which would authorize the issuance of an additional class or classes of mutual capital certificates without the association having met specific financial standards;

      (viii) Not constitute an obligation of the association and shall confer no rights which would give rise to any claim of or action for default;

      (ix) Not be convertible into any account, security, or interest, except that mutual capital certificates may be surrendered in exchange for preferred stock issued in connection with the conversion of the issuing savings association to the stock form pursuant to part 192 of this chapter, provided that the preferred stock shall have substantially the same voting rights, designations, preferences and relative, participating optional, or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations, and restrictions, as the mutual capital certificates exchanged for the preferred stock.

      (x) Provide for charging of losses after the exhaustion of all other items in the regulatory capital account.

      (a)  A financial derivative is a financial contract whose value depends on the value of one or more underlying assets, indices, or reference rates. The most common types of financial derivatives are futures, forward contracts, options, and swaps. A mortgage derivative security, such as a collateralized mortgage obligation or a real estate mortgage investment conduit, is not a financial derivative under this section.

      (b)  A Federal savings association may engage in a transaction involving a financial derivative if the savings association is authorized to invest in the assets underlying the financial derivative, the transaction is safe and sound, and the requirements in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section are met. In general, a Federal savings association that engages in a transaction involving a financial derivative should do so to reduce its risk exposure.

      (c)  (1) A Federal savings association's board of directors is responsible for effective oversight of financial derivatives activities.

      (2) Before a savings association may engage in any transaction involving a financial derivative, your board of directors must establish written policies and procedures governing authorized financial derivatives. The board of directors should review applicable guidance issued by the OCC on establishing a sound risk management program.

      (3) The board of directors must periodically review:

      (i) Compliance with the policies and procedures established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

      (ii) The adequacy of these policies and procedures to ensure that they continue to be appropriate to the nature and scope of the savings association's operations and existing market conditions.

      (4) The board of directors must ensure that management establishes an adequate system of internal controls for transactions involving financial derivatives.

      (d)  (1) The management of a Federal savings association is responsible for daily oversight and management of financial derivatives activities. The management of a Federal savings association must implement the policies and procedures established by the board of directors and must establish a system of internal controls. This system of internal controls should, at a minimum, provide for periodic reporting to the board of directors and management, segregation of duties, and internal review procedures.

      (2) Management must ensure that financial derivatives activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner and should review applicable guidance issued by the OCC on implementing a sound risk management program.

      (e)  A Federal savings association must maintain records adequate to demonstrate compliance with this section and with its board of directors' policies and procedures on financial derivatives.

      (i)  Whenever the savings association or service corporation detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the savings association or service corporation or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the savings association or service corporation, where the savings association or service corporation believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that it was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and it has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, agents or other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in the commission of a criminal act, regardless of the amount involved in the violation.

      (ii)  Whenever the savings association or service corporation detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the savings association or service corporation or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the savings association or service corporation and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, where the savings association or service corporation believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation or series of criminal violations, or that it was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and it has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects.

      (A) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law;

      (B) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or

      (C) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the institution knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.

      (4)  When a service corporation is required to file a SAR under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, either the service corporation or a savings association that wholly or partially owns the service corporation may file the SAR.

      (5)  A savings association or service corporation is required to file a SAR no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a savings association or service corporation may delay filing a SAR for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing, the savings association or service corporation shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and the appropriate Federal banking agency in addition to filing a timely SAR.

      (f)  (1) The OCC may grant a Federal savings association or service corporation an exemption from the requirements of this section. A Federal savings association or service corporation requesting an exemption must submit a request in writing to the OCC. In reviewing such requests, the OCC will consider whether the exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act (if applicable) and safe and sound banking, and may consider other appropriate factors. Any exemption will apply only as expressly stated in the exemption. (A Federal savings association or service corporation requesting an exemption that also requires relief from the requirements of applicable regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR chapter X must submit a request in writing to both the OCC and FinCEN for approval.)

      (2) The OCC will respond in writing to the Federal savings association or service corporation that submits a request pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section after considering whether the exemption is consistent with the factors in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Any exemption granted by the OCC under paragraph (f)(1) of this section will continue for the time specified by the OCC.

      (3) The OCC may extend the period of time or may revoke an exemption granted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Exemptions or extensions may be revoked in the sole discretion of the OCC. Before revoking an exemption, the OCC will provide written notice to the Federal savings association or service corporation of the OCC's intention to revoke an exemption. Such notice will include the basis for the revocation and will provide an opportunity for the Federal savings association or service corporation to submit a response to the OCC. The OCC will consider any response before deciding whether or not to revoke an exemption and provide written notice to the Federal savings association or service corporation of the OCC's final decision to revoke an exemption.

      (4) With respect to requests for exemptions that will also require relief from the requirements of applicable regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR chapter X, upon receiving approval from both the OCC and FinCEN, the requestor will be relieved of its obligations under this section to the extent stated in such approvals.

The unearned precomputed finance charge is the total of that which would have been earned for each such period had the loan not been precomputed, by applying to unpaid balances of principal, according to the actuarial method, an annual percentage rate based on those charges which are considered precomputed finance charges in this section, assuming that all payments were made as originally scheduled, or as deferred, if deferred. The creditor, at its option, may round this annual percentage rate to the nearest one-quarter of one percent; or

    (2) The total precomputed finance charge less the earned precomputed finance charge. The earned precomputed finance charge shall be determined by applying an annual percentage rate based on the total precomputed finance charge (as that term is defined in this section), under the actuarial method, to the unpaid balances for the actual time those balances were unpaid up to the date of prepayment. If a late charge or deferral fee has been collected, it shall be treated as a payment.

    (d)  A debtor may prepay in full or in part the unpaid balance of the loan at any time without penalty. The right to prepay shall be disclosed in the loan contract in type larger than that used for the body of the document.

    (e) —(1)  Federal savings association creditors may enter into agreements with debtors which provide for non-amortized and partially-amortized loans on residential manufactured homes, and such loans shall be governed by the provisions of this section and 12 CFR 560.220 until superseding regulations are issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act.

    (2)  All other creditors may enter into agreements with debtors which provide for non-amortized and partially-amortized loans on residential manufactured homes to the extent authorized by applicable Federal or state law or regulation.

    (f)  (1) No late charge may be assessed, imposed, or collected unless provided for by written contract between the creditor and debtor.

    (2) To the extent that applicable state law does not provide for a longer period of time, no late charge may be collected on an installment which is paid in full on or before the 15th day after its scheduled or deferred due date even though an earlier maturing installment or a late charge on an earlier installment may not have been paid in full. For purposes of assessing late charges, payments received are deemed to be applied first to current installments.

    (3) A late charge may be imposed only once on an installment; however, no such charge may be collected for a late installment which has been deferred.

    (4) To the extent that applicable state law does not provide for a lower charge or a longer grace period, a late charge on any installment not paid in full on or before the 15th day after its scheduled or deferred due date may not exceed five percent of the unpaid amount of the installment.

    (5) If, at any time after imposition of a late charge, the lender provides the borrower with written notice regarding amounts claimed to be due but unpaid, the notice shall separately state the total of all late charges claimed.

    (6) Interest after the final scheduled maturity date may not exceed the maximum rate otherwise allowable under state law for such contracts, and if such interest is charged, no separate late charge may be made on the final scheduled installment.

    (g)  (1) With respect to mobile home credit transactions containing precomputed finance charges, agreements providing for deferral of all or part of one or more installments shall be in writing, signed by the parties, and

    (i) Provide, to the extent that applicable state law does not provide for a lower charge, for a charge not exceeding one percent of each installment or part thereof for each month from the date when such installment was due to the date when it is agreed to become payable and proportionately for a part of each month, counting each day as 1/30th of a month;

    (ii) Incorporate by reference the transaction to which the deferral applied;

    (iii) Disclose each installment or part thereof in the amount to be deferred, the date or dates originally payable, and the date or dates agreed to become payable: and

    (iv) Set forth the fact of the deferral charge, the dollar amount of the charge for each installment to be deferred, and the total dollar amount to be paid by the debtor for the privilege of deferring payment.

    (2) No term of a writing executed by the debtor shall constitute authority for a creditor unilaterally to grant a deferral with respect to which a charge is to be imposed or collected.

    (3) The deferral period is that period of time in which no payment is required or made by reason of the deferral.

    (4) Payments received with respect to deferred installments shall be deemed to be applied first to deferred installments.

    (5) A charge may not be collected for the deferral of an installment or any part thereof if, with respect to that installment, a refinancing or consolidation agreement is concluded by the parties, or a late charge has been imposed or collected, unless such late charge is refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferral charge.

    (h)  (1) Except in the case of abandonment or other extreme circumstances, no action to repossess or foreclose, or to accelerate payment of the entire outstanding balance of the obligation, may be taken against the debtor until 30 days after the creditor sends the debtor a notice of default in the form set forth in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Such notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested. In the case of default on payments, the sum stated in the notice may only include payments in default and applicable late or deferral charges. If the debtor cures the default within 30 days of the postmark of the notice and subsequently defaults a second time, the creditor shall again give notice as described in this paragraph (h)(1). The debtor is not entitled to notice of default more than twice in any one-year period.

    (2) The notice in the following form shall state the nature of the default, the action the debtor must take to cure the default, the creditor's intended actions upon failure of the debtor to cure the default, and the debtor's right to redeem under state law.

    To:

    Date:    , 20

    Notice of Default and Right To Cure Default

    Name, address, and telephone number of creditor

    Account number, if any

    Brief identification of credit transaction

    You are now in default on this credit transaction. You have a right to correct this default within 30 days from the postmarked date of this notice.

    If you correct the default, you may continue with the contract as though you did not default. Your default consists of:

    Describe default alleged

    Within 30 days from the postmarked date of this notice, you may cure your default by (describe the acts necessary for cure, including, if applicable, the amount of payment required, including itemized delinquency or deferral charges).

    Creditor's rights: If you do not correct your default in the time allowed, we may exercise our rights against you under the law by (describe action creditor intends to take).

    If you have any questions, write (the creditor) at the above address or call (creditor's designated employee) at (telephone number) between the hours of and on (state days of week).

    If this default was caused by your failure to make a payment or payments, and you want to pay by mail, please send a check or money order; do not send cash.

    § 190.100   Status of Interpretations issued under Public Law 96-161.

#### § § 190.100

    The OCC continues to adhere to the views expressed in the formal Interpretations issued under the authority of section 105(c) of Public Law 96-161, 93 Stat. 1233 (1979). These interpretations, which relate to the temporary preemption of state interest ceilings contained in Public Law 96-161, may be found at 45 FR 2840 (Jan. 15, 1980); 45 FR 6165 (Jan. 25, 1980); 45 FR 8000 (Feb. 6, 1980); 45 FR 15921 (Mar. 12, 1980).

    § 190.101   State criminal usury statutes.

#### § § 190.101

    (a) Section 501 provides that “the provisions of the constitution or laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount points, finance charges, or other charges shall not apply to any” Federally-related loan secured by a first lien on residential real property, a residential manufactured home, or all the stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential housing cooperative. 12 U.S.C. 1735f-7 note (Supp. IV 1980). The question has arisen as to whether the Federal statute preempts a state law which deems it a criminal offense to charge interest at a rate in excess of that specified in the state law.

    (b) Section 501 preempts all state laws which expressly limit the rate or amount of interest chargeable on a Federally-related residential first mortgage. It does not matter whether the statute in question imposes criminal or civil sanctions; section 501, by its terms, preempts “any” state law which imposes a ceiling on interest rates. The wording of the Federal statute clearly expresses an intent to displace all direct state law restraints on interest. Any state law that conflicts with this Congressional purpose must yield.

    (h)  means a loan on the security of any instrument (whether a mortgage, deed or trust, or land contract) which makes the interest in real property (whether in fee, or in a leasehold or subleasehold) specific security for the payment of the obligation secured by the instrument.

    (1) A security interest in stock or a membership certificate issued to a tenant stockholder or resident member by a cooperative housing organization; and

    (o)  means the several states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

    (p)(1) A  means a real property loan, not originated by a Federal savings association, which was made or assumed during a window-period created by state law and subject to that law, which loan was recorded, at the time of origination or assumption, before October 15, 1982, or within 60 days thereafter (December 14, 1982).

    (2) The window-period begins on:

    (i) The date a state adopted a law (by means of a constitutional provision or statute) prohibiting the unrestricted exercise of due-on-sale clauses upon outright transfers of property securing loans subject to the state law creating the window-period, or the effective date of a constitutional or statutory provision so adopted, whichever is later; or

    (ii) The date on which the highest court of the state rendered a decision prohibiting such unrestricted exercise (or if the highest court has not so decided, the date on which the next highest appellate court rendered a decision resulting in a final judgment which applies statewide), and ends on the earlier of the date such state law prohibition terminated under state law or October 15, 1982.

    (3) Categories of state law which create window-periods by prohibiting the unrestricted exercise of due-on-sale clauses upon outright transfers of property securing loans subject to such state law restrictions include laws or judicial decisions which permit the lender to exercise its option under a due-on-sale clause only where:

    (i) The lender's security interest or the likelihood of repayment is impaired; or

    (ii) The lender is required to accept an assumption of the existing loan without an interest-rate change or with an interest-rate change below the market interest rate currently being offered by the lender on similar loans secured by similar property at the time of the transfer.

    § 191.3   Loans originated by Federal savings associations.

#### § § 191.3

    (a) With regard to any real property loan originated or to be originated by a Federal savings association, as a matter of contract between it and the borrower, a Federal savings association continues to have the power to include a due-on-sale clause in its loan instrument.

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in § 191.5 of this part with respect to any such loan made on the security of a home occupied or to be occupied by the borrower, exercise by any lender of a due-on-sale clause in a loan originated by a Federal savings association shall be exclusively governed by the terms of the loan contract, and all rights and remedies of the lender and borrower shall at all times be fixed and governed by that contract.

    § 191.4   Loans originated by lenders other than Federal savings associations.

#### § § 191.4

    (a) With regard to any real property loan originated by a lender other than a Federal savings association, as a matter of contract between it and the borrower, the lender has the power to include a due on sale clause in its loan instrument.

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section and § 191.5 of this part, the exercise of due-on-sale clauses in loans originated by lenders other than Federal savings associations shall be governed exclusively by the terms of the loan contract, and all rights and remedies of the lender and the borrower shall be fixed and governed by that contract.

    (c)(1) In the case of a window-period loan, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply only in the case of a sale or transfer of the property subject to the real property loan and only if such sale or transfer occurs on or after October 15, 1985:  That:

    (i) With respect to real property loans originated in a state by lenders other than national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal credit unions, a state may otherwise regulate such contracts by state law enacted prior to October 16, 1985, in which case paragraph (b) of this section shall apply only if such state law so provides; and

    (ii) With respect to real property loans originated by national banks and Federal credit unions, the OCC or the National Credit Union Administration Board, respectively, may otherwise regulate such contracts by regulations promulgated prior to October 16, 1985, in which case paragraph (b) of this section shall apply only if such regulation so provides.

    (2) A lender may not exercise its options pursuant to a due-on-sale clause contained in a window-period loan in the case of a sale or transfer of property securing such loan where the sale or transfer occurred prior to October 15, 1982.

    (d)(1) Prior to the sale or transfer of property securing a window-period loan subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

    (i) Any lender in the business of making real property loans may require any successor or transferee of the borrower to supply credit information customarily required by the lender in connection with credit applications, to complete its customary credit application, and to meet customary credit standards applied by such lender, at the date of sale or transfer, to the lender's similar loans secured by similar property.

    (ii) Any lender not in the business of making loans may require any successor or transferee of the borrower to meet credit standards customarily applied by other similarly situated lenders or sellers in the geographic market within which the transaction occurs, for similar loans secured by similar property, prior to the lender's consent to the transfer.

    (2) The lender may exercise a due-on-sale clause in a window-period loan if:

    (i) The successor or transferee of the borrower fails to meet the lender's credit standards as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section; or

    (ii) Upon transfer of the security property and not later than fifteen days after written request by the lender, the successor or transferee of the borrower fails to provide information requested by the lender pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section, to determine whether such successor or transferee of the borrower meets the lender's customary credit standards.

    (3) The lender shall, within thirty days of receipt of a completed credit application and any other related information provided by the successor or transferee of the borrower, determine whether such successor or transferee meets the customary credit standards of the lender and provide written notice to the successor or transferee of its decision, and the reasons in the event of a disapproval. Failure of the lender to provide such notice shall preclude the lender from exercise of its due-on-sale clause upon the sale or transfer of the property securing the loan.

    (4) The lender's right to exercise a due-on-sale clause pursuant to this paragraph (d)(4) is in addition to any other rights afforded the lender by state law regulating window-period loans with regard to the exercise of due-on-sale clauses and loan assumptions.

    § 191.5   Limitation on exercise of due-on-sale clauses.

#### § § 191.5

    (a)  Except as provided in § 191.4(c) and (d)(4) of this part, due-on-sale practices of Federal savings associations and other lenders shall be governed exclusively by the OCC's regulations, in preemption of and without regard to any limitations imposed by state law on either their inclusion or exercise including, without limitation, state law prohibitions against restraints on alienation, prohibitions against penalties and forfeitures, equitable restrictions and state law dealing with equitable transfers.

    (b)  With respect to any loan on the security of a home occupied or to be occupied by the borrower,

    (1) A lender shall not (except with regard to a reverse mortgage) exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon:

    (i) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property:  That such lien or encumbrance is not created pursuant to a contract for deed;

    (ii) The creation of a purchase-money security interest for household appliances;

    (iii) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;

    (iv) The granting of a leasehold interest which has a term of three years or less and which does not contain an option to purchase (that is, either a lease of more than three years or a lease with an option to purchase will allow the exercise of a due-on-sale clause);

    (v) A transfer, in which the transferee is a person who occupies or will occupy the property, which is:

    (A) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of the borrower;

    (B) A transfer where the spouse or child(ren) becomes an owner of the property; or

    (C) A transfer resulting from a decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse becomes an owner of the property; or

    (vi) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains the beneficiary and occupant of the property, unless, as a condition precedent to such transfer, the borrower refuses to provide the lender with reasonable means acceptable to the lender by which the lender will be assured of timely notice of any subsequent transfer of the beneficial interest or change in occupancy.

    (2) A lender shall not impose a prepayment penalty or equivalent fee when the lender or party acting on behalf of the lender.

    (i) Declares by written notice that the loan is due pursuant to a due-on-sale clause or

    (ii) Commences a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding to enforce a due-on-sale clause or to seek payment in full as a result of invoking such clause.

    (3) A lender shall not impose a prepayment penalty or equivalent fee when the lender or party acting on behalf of the lender fails to approve within 30 days the completed credit application of a _qualified transferee_ of the security property to assume the loan in accordance with the terms of the loan, and thereafter the borrower transfers the security property to such transferee and prepays the loan in full within 120 days after receipt by the lender of the completed credit application. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a  is a person who qualifies for the loan under the lender's applicable underwriting standards and who occupies or will occupy the security property.

    (4) A lender waives its option to exercise a due-on-sale clause as to a specific transfer if, before the transfer, the lender and the existing borrower's prospective successor in interest agree in writing that the successor in interest will be obligated under the terms of the loan and that interest on sums secured by the lender's security interest will be payable at a rate the lender shall request. Upon such agreement and resultant waiver, a lender shall release the existing borrower from all obligations under the loan instruments, and the lender is deemed to have made a new loan to the existing borrower's successor in interest. The waiver and release apply to all loans secured by homes occupied by borrowers made by a Federal savings association after July 31, 1976, and to all loans secured by homes occupied by borrowers made by other lenders after the effective date of this regulation.

    (5) Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be construed to restrict a lender's right to enforce a due-on-sale clause upon the subsequent occurrence of any event which disqualifies a transfer for a previously-applicable exception under that paragraph (b)(1).

    (c)  Paragraph (b) of this section does not prohibit a lender from requiring, as a condition to an assumption, continued maintenance of mortgage insurance by the existing borrower's successor in interest, whether by endorsement of the existing policy or by entrance into a new contract of insurance.

    Subpart A—Standard Conversions

      Prior to Conversion

        § 192.100   Preparing for a conversion.

#### § § 192.100

        (a)  A savings association's board, or a subcommittee of its board, must meet, in person or electronically, with the appropriate Federal banking agency before the savings association passes its plan of conversion. At this meeting the savings association must provide the appropriate Federal banking agency with a written strategic plan that outlines the objectives of the proposed conversion and the intended use of the conversion proceeds.

        (b)  A savings association also should consult with the appropriate Federal banking agency before filing its application for conversion. The appropriate Federal banking agency will discuss the information that the savings association must include in the application for conversion, general issues that it may confront in the conversion process, and any other pertinent issues.

        § 192.105   Information required in business plan.

#### § § 192.105

        (a)  Prior to filing an application for conversion, a savings association must adopt a business plan reflecting its intended plans for deployment of the proposed conversion proceeds. The savings association's business plan is required, under § 192.150, to be included in its application for conversion. At a minimum, the business plan must address:

        (1) The savings association's projected operations and activities for three years following the conversion. These projections must include how the savings association will accomplish the following by the final year of the business plan:

        (i) Deploy the conversion proceeds at the converted savings association (and holding company, if applicable);

        (ii) What opportunities are available to reasonably achieve its planned deployment of conversion proceeds in the proposed market areas; and

        (iii) How the deployment will provide a reasonable return on investment commensurate with investment risk, investor expectations, and industry norms. The savings association must include three years of projected financial statements. The business plan must provide that the converted savings association must retain at least 50 percent of the net conversion proceeds. The appropriate Federal banking agency may require that a larger percentage of proceeds remain in the institution.

        (2) The savings association's plan for deploying conversion proceeds to meet credit and lending needs in the proposed market areas. The appropriate Federal banking agencies strongly discourage business plans that provide for a substantial investment in mortgage securities or other securities, except as an interim measure to facilitate orderly, prudent deployment of proceeds during the three years following the conversion or as part of a properly managed leverage strategy.

        (3) The risks associated with the savings association's plan for deployment of conversion proceeds, and the effect of this plan on management resources, staffing, and facilities.

        (4) The expertise of the savings association's management and board of directors, or plans for adequate staffing and controls to prudently manage the growth, expansion, new investment, and other operations and activities proposed in the business plan.

        (b)  The savings association may not project returns of capital or special dividends in any part of the business plan. A newly converted company may not plan on stock repurchases in the first year of the business plan.

        § 192.110   Review of business plan by chief executive officer and board of directors.

#### § § 192.110

        (a)  A savings association's chief executive officer and members of the board of directors must review, and at least two-thirds of the board of directors must approve, the business plan.

        (b)  A savings association's chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of the board of directors must certify that the business plan accurately reflects the intended plans for deployment of conversion proceeds, and that any new initiatives reflected in the business plan are reasonably achievable. The savings association must submit these certifications with its business plan, as part of its application for conversion under § 192.150.

        § 192.115   Review of business plan by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

#### § § 192.115

        (a)  The appropriate Federal banking agency will review the savings association's business plan to determine that it demonstrates a safe and sound deployment of conversion proceeds, as part of its review of the application for conversion. In making its determination, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider how the savings association has addressed the applicable factors of § 192.105. No single factor will be determinative.

        (b)  A savings association must file its business plan as a separate confidential exhibit to the Form AC with the appropriate OCC licensing office if it is a Federal savings association, or with the appropriate Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) region if it is a State savings association. The appropriate Federal banking agency may request additional information, if necessary, to support its determination under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  If the appropriate Federal banking agency approves a savings association's application for conversion and the conversion is completed, the savings association must operate within the parameters of its business plan. The savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for any material deviations from its business plan.

        § 192.120   Confidentiality of conversion information.

#### § § 192.120

        (a)  A savings association may discuss information about its conversion with individuals that the savings association authorizes to prepare documents for its conversion.

        (b)  Except as permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, a savings association must keep all information about its conversion confidential until its board of directors adopts the plan of conversion.

        (c)  If a savings association violates this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency may require the savings association to take remedial action. For example, the appropriate Federal banking agency may require the savings association to take any or all of the following actions:

        (1) Publicly announce that the savings association is considering a conversion;
