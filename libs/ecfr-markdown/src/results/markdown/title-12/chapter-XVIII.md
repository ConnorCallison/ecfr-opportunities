      § 1806.100   Purpose.

#### § § 1806.100

      The purpose of the Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program is to provide grants to Insured Depository Institutions that provide financial and technical assistance to Community Development Financial Institutions and increase their activities in Distressed Communities.

      § 1806.101   Summary.

#### § § 1806.101

      Through the BEA Program, the CDFI Fund will provide monetary awards in the form of grants to Applicants selected by the CDFI Fund that increase their investments in or provide other support of CDFIs, increase their lending and investment activities in Distressed Communities, or increase their provision of certain services and assistance. Distressed Communities must meet minimum geographic, poverty, and unemployment criteria. Applicants are selected to receive BEA Program Awards through a merit-based, competitive application process. The amount of a BEA Program Award is based on the increase in Qualified Activities that are carried out by the Applicant during the Assessment Period. BEA Program Awards are disbursed by the CDFI Fund after the Recipient has successfully completed projected Qualified Activities. Each Recipient will enter into an Award Agreement, which will require it to abide by terms and conditions pertinent to any assistance received under this part, including the requirement that BEA Program Award proceeds must be used for Eligible Activities, and in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, as applicable. All BEA Program Awards are made subject to funding availability.

Where a certificate of deposit matures and is then rolled over during the Baseline Period or the Assessment Period, as applicable, the CDFI Fund will assess the value of the full amount of the rolled-over deposit. Where an existing loan is refinanced (meaning, a new loan is originated to pay off an existing loan, whether or not there is a change in the applicable loan terms), the CDFI Fund will only assess the value of any increase in the principal amount of the refinanced loan;

      (2) Project Investments at the original amount of the purchase of stock, limited partnership interest, other ownership interest, or grant;

      (3) Deposit Liabilities at the dollar amount deposited as measured by comparing the net change in the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the Applicant during the Baseline Period with the net change in the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the Applicant during the Assessment Period, as described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section:

      (i) The Applicant shall calculate the net change in deposits during the Baseline Period by comparing the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the close of business the day before the beginning of the Baseline Period and at the close of business on the last day of the Baseline Period; and

      (ii) The Applicant shall calculate the net change in such deposits during the Assessment Period by comparing the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the close of business the day before the beginning of the Assessment Period and at the close of business on the last day of the Assessment Period;

      (5) Financial Services (other than those for which the CDFI Fund has established a predetermined value), Community Services, and CDFI Support Activities consisting of Technical Assistance based on the administrative costs of providing such services.

      (2) Constitutes a legally binding agreement between the Applicant and a borrower or investee, which agreement specifies the final terms and conditions of the transaction, except that any contingencies included in the final agreement must be typical of such transaction and acceptable (both in the judgment of the CDFI Fund); and

      (3) An initial cash disbursement of loan or investment proceeds has occurred in a manner that is consistent with customary business practices and is reasonable given the nature of the transaction (as determined by the CDFI Fund), unless it is normal business practice to make no initial disbursement at closing and the Applicant demonstrates that the borrower has access to the proceeds, subject to reasonable conditions as may be determined by the CDFI Fund.

      (g)  An Applicant must only measure the amount of a Qualified Activity that it reasonably expects to disburse to an investee, borrower, or other recipient within one year of the end of the applicable Assessment Period, or such other period as may be set forth by the CDFI Fund in the applicable NOFA.

      (c)  (1) The estimated award amount for the CDFI Related Activities category will be equal to the applicable award percentage of the net increase in each activity-type ( Equity Investments/Equity Like-Loans; and CDFI Support Activities) under the CDFI Related Activities category between the Baseline Period and Assessment Period.

      (2) The estimated award amount for the Distressed Community Financing Activities category will be equal to the applicable award percentage of the weighted value of each subcategory of Distressed Community Financing Activities ( Consumer Loans; and Commercial Loans and Investments) between the Baseline Period and Assessment Period. The weighted value of the applicable subcategories shall be calculated by:

      (i) Subtracting the Baseline Period value of such subcategory from the Assessment Period value of such subcategory to yield a difference; and

      (ii) Multiplying the difference by the applicable Priority Factor (as set forth in the applicable NOFA).

      (3) The estimated award amount for the Service Activities category will be equal to the applicable award percentage of the weighted value of each activity type between the Baseline Period and Assessment Period. The weighted value of the applicable activity type shall be calculated by:

      (i) Subtracting the Baseline Period value of such Qualified Activity from the Assessment Period value of such Qualified Activity to yield a difference; and

      (ii) Multiplying the difference by the applicable Priority Factor (as set forth in the applicable NOFA).

      (d)  The CDFI Fund will determine the eligibility of each transaction for which an Applicant has applied for a BEA Program Award. Based upon this review, the CDFI Fund will calculate the actual award amount for which such Applicant is eligible.

If the amount of appropriated funds available during a funding round is sufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, and an Applicant meets all of the program requirements specified in this part, then such Applicant shall receive an actual award amount that is calculated by the CDFI Fund in the manner specified in § 1806.403.

      (b)  If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, then the CDFI Fund will select Recipients and determine actual award amounts based on the process described in paragraph (c) of this section and any established maximum dollar amount of awards that may be awarded for the Distressed Community Financing Activities subcategories, as described in the applicable NOFA.

      (c)  In circumstances where there are insufficient funds to cover estimated awards, the CDFI Fund will rank Applicants based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, and in each category of Qualified Activity ( Service Activities) according to the priorities described in this paragraph (c). Selections within each priority category will be based on the Applicants' relative rankings within each category, and based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, subject to the availability of funds.

      (1)  If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient for all estimated award amounts, first priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.

      (2)  If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first priority Applicants but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, second priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Distressed Community Financing Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in Distressed Community Financing Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.

      (3)  If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first and second priority Applicants, but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, third priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.

      (d)  The CDFI Fund will determine actual award amounts based upon the availability of funds, increases in Qualified Activities from the Baseline to the Assessment Period, and an Applicant's priority ranking. If an Applicant receives an award for more than one priority category described in this section, the CDFI Fund will combine the award amounts into a single BEA Program Award.

      (e)  The CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may use any deobligated funds or funds not obligated during a funding round:

      (1) To select Applicants not previously selected, using the calculation and selection process contained in this part;

      (2) To make additional monies available for a subsequent funding round; or

      (3) As otherwise authorized by the Act.

      § 1807.401   Affordable Housing—Rental Housing.

#### § § 1807.401

      To qualify as Affordable Housing, each rental Multi-family housing Project financed with a CMF Award must have at least 20 percent of the units rent-restricted to any combination of Low-Income, Very Low-Income, or Extremely Low-Income Families and must comply with the rent limits as set forth in the applicable NOFA and Assistance Agreement in any CMF funding round. The CDFI Fund may require a greater percentage of the units per Project to be income-targeted and/or require a specific targeted income commitment in any given CMF round, as set forth in the applicable NOFA and Assistance Agreement.

      (a)  The gross rent limits for Affordable Housing are further specified in the Assistance Agreement.

      (b)  The Recipient shall require that the owner of a rental unit cannot refuse to lease the unit to a Section 8 Program certificate or voucher holder (24 CFR part 982, Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Unified Rule for Tenant-Based Assistance under the Section 8 Rental Certificate Program and the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program) or to the holder of a comparable document evidencing participation in a HOME tenant-based rental assistance program because of the status of the prospective tenant as a holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME tenant-based assistance document.

      (c)  The Recipient shall ensure that utility allowances and submetering rules are consistent with regulations concerning utility allowances and submetering in buildings that are subject to gross rent restrictions as set forth in the Assistance Agreement and under IRC sec. 42(g)(2), as applicable.

      (d)  Housing under this section must meet the affordability requirements during the Affordability Period. The affordability requirements apply without regard to the term of any loan or mortgage or the transfer of ownership and must be imposed by deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other recording instruments. Upon receipt of a written approval from the CDFI Fund, a Recipient may use a different recording instrument as provided for in the Assistance Agreement. The affordability restrictions are allowed to terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. To the extent allowed under State law, in the event of a sale of property at foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, short sale or other types of disposition, proceeds available to pay off a mortgage financed with a CMF Award shall be treated as Program Income.

      (e)  All tenants occupying rental CMF Units shall be required to enter into a written lease or rental agreement setting forth the terms and requirements which are, but not limited to, compliance with applicable State and local law.

      (f)  (1) At the time of each initial lease and occupancy, the tenant income shall be determined to ascertain income eligibility. During the Affordability Period, the existing tenant income shall be re-examined in a manner as set forth in the Assistance Agreement. Tenant income examination and verification are ultimately the responsibility of the Recipient. Tenant income shall include income from all Family members. The Recipient must require the Project owner to obtain information on rents and occupancy of Affordable Housing financed or supported with a CMF Award in order to demonstrate compliance with this section.

      (2) One of the following two definitions of “annual income” must be used to determine whether a Family is income-eligible:

      (i) Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual income tax purposes; or

      (ii) Annual Income as defined at 24 CFR 5.609 (except that when determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied Rehabilitation Project, the value of the homeowner's principal residence may be excluded from the calculation of “Net Family Assets,” as defined in 24 CFR 5.603).

      (3) The CDFI Fund reserves the right to deem certain government programs, under which a Family is a recipient, as income eligible for purposes of meeting the tenant income requirements under this section.

      (g)  (1) CMF Units continue to qualify as Affordable Housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to the CDFI Fund are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.

      (2) The maximum rent for tenants whose incomes no longer qualify is either 30 percent of the Family's annual income, or the amount payable by the tenants under State or local law, whichever is less; however, tenants whose income exceeds the Eligible-Income level are not required to pay rent in excess of the market rent for comparable, unassisted units in the neighborhood.

      (3) If the income of a tenant of a CMF Unit no longer qualifies, the Recipient may designate another unit within the Project as a rent-restricted replacement unit that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category as the original unit, as further set forth in the Recipient's Assistance Agreement. If there is not an available replacement unit, the Recipient must fill the first available vacancy with a tenant that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category of the original unit as necessary to maintain compliance with the CMF requirements and the Assistance Agreement.

      § 1807.402   Affordable Housing—Homeownership.

#### § § 1807.402

      (a)  (1) A Recipient that uses the CMF Award to finance or support the Purchase of Housing by a qualified Homebuyer must ensure that the Housing and Homebuyer meet the affordability requirements of this subpart as follows:

      (i)  The Housing must be a _Single-family housing._

      (ii)  The Single-family housing does not exceed the purchase price limits for the area under the HUD FHA Section 203(b) Mortgage Insurance Program, or any other index designated by the CDFI Fund as set forth in the applicable Assistance Agreement; the related mortgage must be originated based upon an assessment of whether the Homebuyer can repay the loan based on terms and conditions that are transparent and understandable to the Homebuyer, and the mortgage is affordable to the Homebuyer over the life of the loan.

      (iii)  The Single-family housing must be purchased by a qualifying Homebuyer.

      (iv)  A qualifying Homebuyer must have a household income at no greater than Eligible-Income. To determine whether a Homebuyer qualifies as Eligible Income (or at any other income level specified in the Assistance Agreement) under this section, the Recipient must use the Homebuyer's adjusted gross income as defined under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual income tax reporting purposes, or other methodology for determining income eligibility as provided in the Assistance Agreement. Homebuyers of one- to four- unit Single-family housing may rent the additional unit(s) as Permanent Housing if at least one unit is maintained as the principal residence of the Homebuyer.

      (v)  Single-family housing under this section must become the principal residence of the Homebuyer at the time of Purchase and is subject to the affordability requirements during the Affordability Period and as further set forth in § 1807.402(a)(1)(vi). The Affordability Period does not apply to additional units rented as Permanent Housing, as described in § 1807.402(a)(1)(iv).

      (vi)  To ensure that the CMF Awards are being used for qualifying Families during the Affordability Period, recoupment, replacement, and/or resale strategies must be established and imposed by the Recipient. A recoupment, replacement, and/or resale strategy must ensure that:

      (A) In the event the qualifying Family sells the Housing in five years or less from the date of Purchase, the Housing must be sold to an Eligible-Income Family meeting the qualifications set forth in § 1807.402. Otherwise, the CMF Award investment must be recouped by the Recipient and the Housing replaced with a replacement unit to satisfy the affordability requirement for the remainder of the Affordability Period. If the Housing is replaced, the replacement unit must be sold to an Eligible-Income Family and must also meet the qualifications set forth in § 1807.402.

      (B) In the event the qualifying Family sells the Housing any time after five years from the date of Purchase but before the end of the Affordability Period, the Housing must either be sold to a new Eligible-Income Family or, if the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-Income Family, the CMF investment must be recouped as Program Income in a proportional amount from net sale proceeds, as further set forth in the Assistance Agreement. If the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-Income Family after the five-year anniversary of the Purchase date and the Recipient recoups a proportional amount of the CMF Awards as Program Income, the Recipient is not required to replace the sold Housing with a replacement unit.

      (2) The Recipient may design and implement its own recoupment, replacement, and/or resale strategy, subject to the requirements of § 1807.402(a)(1)(vi) to maintain compliance with the CMF requirements and the Assistance Agreement. Deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar instruments may be used as the mechanism to impose a strategy. The Recipient shall report to the CDFI Fund the event of resale and/or recoupment and redeployment of the CMF Award, or an equivalent amount, in the manner described in the Assistance Agreement or other guidance issued by the CDFI Fund.

      (3) The affordability restrictions are allowed to terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage to HUD. The termination of the affordability restrictions pursuant to any of the aforementioned terminating events will result in the Housing no longer being subject to a recoupment, replacement, and/or resale strategy as previously imposed by the Recipient. The Recipient may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the Housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original Affordability Period, the owner of record before the termination event obtains an ownership interest in the Housing.

      (b)  Single-family housing that is currently owned by a qualifying Family, as set forth in § 1807.400, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the following requirements of this paragraph (b):

      (1) The estimated value of the Single-family housing, after Rehabilitation, does not exceed the purchase price limits for the area, as used in the HUD FHA Section 203(b) Mortgage Insurance Program, or any other index designated by the CDFI Fund. The underlying mortgage(s) should be affordable for the Homebuyer;

      (2) The Single-family housing is owned by a qualifying Family as set forth in § 1807.400 and is the only principal residence of the Family at the time of Project Commitment and remains the principal residence of the Family throughout the Affordability Period as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;

      (3) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) must meet the affordability requirements during the Affordability Period upon Project Completion or meet the recoupment, replacement, and/or resale provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and

      (4) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) currently owned by a qualifying Family may be rehabilitated to convert a portion of the Housing into one to three permanent additional units, each with a separate means of ingress/egress, kitchen, sleeping area, bathing area, and bathroom facilities, independent of the primary dwelling. The additional units may be rented as Permanent Housing as long as the primary dwelling remains the principal residence of the Family. While the Affordability Period applies to the primary dwelling, it does not apply to the additional units discussed in this section.

      (c)  The owner must meet the definition of Homebuyer and the ownership in the Single-family housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of Homeownership as defined in § 1807.104.

      (d)  Newly constructed Single-family housing that is built on property currently owned by a Family that will occupy the Single-family housing upon Project Completion, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (e)  Rental CMF Units may be converted to Homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing tenants only under an existing documented rent-to-own program to enable the tenants to become Homebuyers in accordance with the requirements of this section. The Homeownership units are subject to a minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining rental Affordability Period, as further specified in the Assistance Agreement.

      § 1808.101   Summary.

#### § § 1808.101

      This section provides a summary overview of certain key provisions of the interim rule, the detailed requirements of which are set forth in subsequent subparts.

      (a)  Through the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, the Guarantor will provide a Guarantee for Bonds issued by Qualified Issuers as part of a Bond Issue.

      (b)  Pursuant to the Act at 12 U.S.C. 4713a(e), a Bond Issue shall comprise Bonds having a minimum aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 and a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000.

A Bond Rate for each advance of funds under a Bond will be established by the Bond Purchaser as of the date of the respective advance, as provided in the Bond.

      (c)  The Qualified Issuer will use Bond Proceeds to make Bond Loans to Eligible CDFIs for Eligible Purposes, as those terms are defined in section 1808.102. The CDFI Fund will evaluate each Eligible CDFI using standard Bond Loan Requirements to assess their creditworthiness and capacity to receive a Bond Loan. Each Eligible CDFI may borrow a Bond Loan in an amount that is at least $10,000,000. The Bond Loan Rate shall be the same as the Bond Rate on the particular advance of funds under the Bond that funds the Bond Loan. The aggregate of the principal amounts of the Bond Loans must not exceed the maximum principal amount of the corresponding Bond Issue. The Qualified Issuer must execute Bond Loan documents for 100 percent of the principal amount of each Bond on the Bond Issue Date. Bond Loan proceeds may not be drawn down from the Qualified Issuer until the Eligible CDFI has an immediate use for the Bond Loan proceeds. Five percent, or such other amount that is determined by the CDFI Fund in its sole discretion, of Bond Loan proceeds may be used by an Eligible CDFI to capitalize Loan Loss Reserves.

      (d)  If the Eligible CDFI uses Bond Loan proceeds to make Secondary Loans, the Eligible CDFI must execute Secondary Loan documents (in the form of promissory notes) with Secondary Borrowers as follows:

      (1) Not later than 12 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing at least 50 percent of such Eligible CDFI's Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans; and

      (2) Not later than 24 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing 100 percent of such Eligible CDFI's Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans (excluding any amounts used for payment of Bond Issuance Fees pursuant to section 1808.304(b)).

      (e)  Bonds, Bond Loans and Secondary Loans shall have terms and conditions as set forth in Subpart F of this interim rule including at a minimum, that:

      (1) Each Bond shall be a nonrecourse obligation of the Qualified Issuer, payable solely from amounts available pursuant to the Bond Documents. Each promissory note evidencing a Bond Loan shall be a general recourse obligation of the Eligible CDFI and secured by a first lien on collateral. Each Secondary Loan shall be secured by a first lien on collateral and payable solely from amounts available pursuant to the Secondary Loan documents;

      (2) The maturity date of a Bond shall not be later than 30 years after the Bond Issue Date. The maturity date of Bond Loans and Secondary Loans may be earlier than, but may not be later than, the maturity date of the corresponding Bond;

      (3) The Bonds shall be purchased by the Bond Purchaser on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Bond Purchaser, the Guarantor, and the CDFI Fund (under specific requirements set forth in § 1808.302 and the Bond Documents); and

      (4) The Guarantor shall guarantee payments on Bonds issued as part of a Bond Issue in such forms and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties and requirements (including requirements for audits) as set forth in this interim rule in Subpart F. These requirements may be expanded upon through the program's Notice of Guarantee Availability, the Bond Documents, and the Bond Loan documents. The Qualified Issuer shall enter into the applicable Bond Documents to evidence its acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Guarantee.

      (2) Interest on each advance of funds under a Bond shall be computed as provided in the Bond.

      (3) A principal and interest payment schedule will be determined and provided to the Qualified Issuer for each advance of funds under a Bond, based on the Bond Rate established for the respective advance.

      (i)  (1) Any Bond shall be subject to mandatory prepayment if Bond Loans or Secondary Loans are not made in a timely manner, as follows:

      (i) On the Calculation Date (as defined in subsection 1808.308(e)) of each year, any amount retained in the Relending Subaccount that exceeds the Relending Subaccount Maximum (as defined in subsection 1808.308(d)) by $100,000 or more shall be applied to prepay Bonds on the next succeeding payment date.

      (ii) Any amounts derived from the liquidation of collateral from the Bond Loan and/or Secondary Loan in connection with the exercise by the Guarantor, the Qualified Issuer or the Bondholder of remedies upon default of the Bond Loan shall be applied, immediately upon liquidation, in the following order (inclusive of reasonable fees and expenses associated therewith):

The Risk-Share Pool must remain in place throughout the term of the Guarantee. Amounts in the Risk Share Pool Fund will not be returned to Eligible CDFIs until maturity of all of the Bonds, and termination of all of the Bond Loans, within a Bond Issue.

      (a) At each disbursement of the Bond Loan proceeds, each Eligible CDFI shall deposit an amount that is equal to three percent of the disbursement, for a total of three percent of the guaranteed amount outstanding of the Bond, from monies other than Bond Loan proceeds, into the applicable subaccount of the Risk-Share Pool Fund. Such monies shall remain in said account throughout the term of the Bond.

      (b) Any interest on a Bond Loan in excess of the Bond Loan Rate derived by the Qualified Issuer during any period during which the Bond Loan Payment Default Rate applies shall also be deposited in the Risk-Share Pool Fund.

      (c) The Risk-Share Pool Fund shall be applied by the Master Servicer/Trustee to payments of debt service on the Bond Issue in the event that the Eligible CDFI defaults in the corresponding payment of debt service on the Bond Loan. The defaulted Eligible CDFI's deposit shall be applied first to any such payment of debt service. After depletion of the defaulted Eligible CDFI's deposit, each remaining Eligible CDFI's deposit shall be applied prorata to any such payment of debt service. Monies on deposit in the Risk-Share Pool Fund shall be applied to such payments and shall be depleted in full prior to any draw on the Guarantee.

      (d) Eligible CDFIs (excluding the Eligible CDFI in default and responsible for a draw) shall not be required to replenish the Risk-Share Pool Fund in the event of a draw.

      (e) The Risk Share Pool deposit shall be sufficient collateral to secure any draw on Bond Loan proceeds related to the costs of issuance pursuant to 1808.304(b).

      (g) Amounts in the Risk Share Pool Fund will not be returned to Eligible CDFIs until maturity of all of the Bonds, and termination of all of the Bond Loans, within a Bond Issue. Upon maturity of all of the Bonds, and termination of the Bond Loans, within a Bond Issue, the pro rata amount of each Eligible CDFI's payments in the Risk-Share Pool shall be returned to each Eligible CDFI; provided however, that such Eligible CDFI has properly replenished any draws on the Risk-Share Pool attributed to nonpayment of its Bond Loan and the corresponding Bond.

      (b)  (1) If the Eligible CDFI uses Bond Loan proceeds to make Secondary Loans, the Eligible CDFI must execute Secondary Loan documents (in the form of promissory notes) with Secondary Borrowers as follows:

      (i) Not later than 12 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing at least 50 percent of the Eligible CDFIs' Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans; and

      (ii) Not later than 24 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing 100 percent of the Eligible CDFIs' Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans (excluding any amounts used for payment of Bond Issuance Fees pursuant to section 1808.304(b)).

      (2) In the event that the Eligible CDFI does not comply with the foregoing requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the available Bond Loan proceeds at the end of the applicable period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the amount required by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) minus the amount previously committed to the Secondary Loans in the applicable period. Consistent with the corresponding Bond Loan, the Secondary Loans shall be drawn down by the Secondary Borrowers upon demonstration of an Eligible Purpose.

      (c)  The rate of interest with respect to each Secondary Loan shall be determined by each Eligible CDFI in accordance with the following limitations:

      (1) With respect to each Secondary Loan, the Eligible CDFI will be required to propose to the CDFI Fund:

      (i) A minimum and maximum spread over the corresponding Bond Loan Rate which will represent the standard minimum and maximum interest rate (Minimum Secondary Loan Rate and Maximum Secondary Loan Rate, respectively); and

      (ii) A maximum spread over the Maximum Secondary Loan Rate in event of a Secondary Loan default (Maximum Secondary Loan Default Spread).

      (2) The CDFI Fund reserves the right to evaluate, approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed Minimum Secondary Loan Rate, Maximum Secondary Loan Rate, and Maximum Secondary Loan Default Spread before approving any Guarantee Application.

      (d)  The Eligible CDFI may charge a default rate on the Secondary Loan so long as such rate does not exceed the Maximum Secondary Rate, plus the Maximum Secondary Loan Default Spread.

      (e)  The maturity date with respect to the Secondary Loan shall be in accordance with the requirements of the applicable Secondary Loan Requirements. The maturity date of Secondary Loans may be earlier than, but may not be later than, the maturity date of the corresponding Bond.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Eligible CDFI shall propose a timeframe for disbursement in connection with each Secondary Loan, which timeframe shall be subject to the requirements set forth in the Secondary Loan Requirements.

      (i)  Secondary Loans shall amortize as determined by the Eligible CDFI; provided that Secondary Loan amortization installments shall conform to the requirements of the applicable Secondary Loan Requirements.

      (j)  Secondary Loans shall be subject to prepayment as determined by the Eligible CDFI; provided that the Secondary Loan documents may provide for modification of Secondary Loan terms (so long as such modification does not affect the corresponding Bond or Bond Loan) and shall provide for mandatory prepayment of the Secondary Loan from liquidation of collateral upon the exercise of default remedies by the Eligible CDFI, the Qualified Issuer or the Guarantor as required by the Bond, the Bond Loan documents, or the Agreement to Guarantee, as applicable.

      (k)  As Secondary Loans are repaid, the Eligible CDFI may, through the Relending Fund, Refinance and substitute as collateral for the Bond Loan other loan(s) for Eligible Purposes that meet the required Secondary Loan Requirements, provided that the Eligible CDFI makes Bond Loan payments as required. If the outstanding principal balance of the Bond Loan exceeds the outstanding principal balance of the Bond Loan in use for the Eligible Purposes, the Eligible CDFI shall repay the difference, which shall be deposited in the Relending Account, and credited to the corresponding Relending Subaccount.

#### § § 1815.105

    (a) The possible environmental effects of an Application, including any Comprehensive Business Plan, must be considered along with technical, economic, and other factors throughout the decisionmaking process. For most Fund actions there are two distinct stages in the decisionmaking process:

    (1) Preliminary approval stage, at which point applications are selected for funding; and

    (2) Final approval and funding stage.

    (b) Environmental review shall be integrated into the decisionmaking process of the Fund as follows:

    (1) During the preliminary approval stage, the designated Fund official shall determine whether the Application proposes actions which are categorically excluded, or normally require an environmental assessment or an EIS;

    (2) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application proposes actions which normally require an environmental assessment or an EIS, the applicant shall be informed that the final approval and funding, in addition to any other conditions, is contingent upon:

    (i) The applicant supplying to the Fund all information necessary for the Fund to perform or have performed any environmental review required by this part;

    (ii) The applicant not using any Fund financial assistance to perform any of such proposed actions in the Application that affect the physical environment until Fund approval is received; and

    (iii) The outcome of the environmental review required by this part;

    (3) The Fund will perform or have performed the environmental reviews required by this part;

    (4) A preliminary approval of an Application may be withdrawn or further conditions may be imposed based upon the outcome of an environmental review required by this part; and

    (5) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application proposes actions that require an environmental assessment or an EIS, the environmental assessment and/or EIS must be completed and circulated prior to the use of Federal funds for any activity that triggers the need for an environmental assessment and/or EIS.

    § 1815.106   Supplemental environmental review.

#### § § 1815.106

    (a) The designated Fund official shall determine whether the proposed actions in the Application are sufficiently definite to perform a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage.

    (b) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application is sufficiently definite to perform a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage, no conditions for supplemental environmental review shall be imposed.

    (c) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application, or any part of the Application, is not sufficiently definite to complete a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage, the Fund shall require a supplemental environmental review prior to the taking of any action directly using Fund financial assistance that is not categorically excluded from environmental review or for which an environmental assessment or EIS has not been approved by the Fund. The applicant shall notify the designated Fund official when proposing any action requiring a supplemental environmental review and shall supply to the Fund all information necessary for the Fund to perform the supplemental environmental review. The Fund shall perform or have performed such a supplemental environmental review. The applicant shall not use any Fund financial assistance to perform any of the proposed actions requiring a supplemental environmental review that affect the physical environment until Fund approval for such action is received.

    § 1815.107   Determination of review requirement.

#### § § 1815.107

    In deciding whether to prepare an EIS, the designated Fund official shall determine whether the proposal is one that normally:

    (a) Requires an EIS;

    (b) Requires an environmental assessment, but not necessarily an EIS; or

    (c) Does not require either an EIS or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).

    § 1815.108   Actions that normally require an EIS.

#### § § 1815.108

    (a) If necessary, the Fund shall perform or have performed an environmental assessment to determine if an Application, or any portion of an Application, requires an EIS. However, it may be readily apparent that a proposed action in an Application will have a significant impact on the environment; in such cases, an environmental assessment is not required and the Fund shall immediately begin to prepare, or have prepared, an EIS.

    (b) An EIS normally is required where an Application proposes to directly use financial assistance from the Fund for any Project that would:

    (1) Remove, demolish, convert, or substantially rehabilitate 2,500 or more existing housing units, or would result in the construction or installation of 2,500 or more new housing units, or which would provide sites for 2,500 or more new housing units; or

    (2) Remove, demolish, convert, or substantially rehabilitate 1,500,000 square feet or more of commercial space, or would result in the construction or installation of 1,500,000 square feet or more of new commercial space, or which would provide sites for 1,500,000 square feet or more of new commercial space.

    § 1815.109   Preparation of an EIS.

#### § § 1815.109

    (a) If the Fund determines that an EIS should be prepared, it shall publish a notice of intent in the  in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1508.22 of the CEQ regulations. After publishing the notice of intent, the Fund shall begin to prepare or have prepared the EIS. Procedures for preparing the EIS are set forth in 40 CFR part 1502 of the CEQ regulations.

    (b) The Fund may supplement a draft or final EIS at any time. The Fund shall prepare or have prepared a supplement to either the draft or final EIS when:

    (1) Substantial changes are proposed to an action contained in the draft or final EIS that are relevant to environmental concerns or there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts; or

    (2) Actions are proposed which relate or are similar to other action(s) taken or proposed and that together have a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.

    § 1815.110   Categorical exclusion.

#### § § 1815.110

    The CEQ regulations provide for the categorical exclusion of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (40 CFR 1508.4). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an EIS is required for such actions. An action which falls into one of the categories below may still require the preparation of an EIS or environmental assessment if the designated Fund official determines it meets the criteria stated in § 1815.109 or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. The Fund has determined the following categorical exclusions:

    (a) Actions directly related to the administration or operation of the Fund (e.g. personnel actions, including, but not limited to, staff recruitment and training; purchase of goods and services for the Fund, including, but not limited to, furnishings, equipment, supplies and services; space acquisition; property management; and security);

    (b) Actions directly related to and implementing proposals for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and EIS have been prepared;

    (c) Actions directly related to the granting or receipt of Bank Enterprise Act awards pursuant to part 1806 of this chapter;

    (d) Actions directly related to training and/or technical assistance;

    (e) Projects for the acquisition, disposition, rehabilitation and/or modernization of 500 existing housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:

    (4) The Project does not involve the demolition of one or more buildings containing the primary use served by the project that, together, have more than 20 percent of the square footage of the Project;

    (f) Projects for the construction of 200 housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:

    (1) The Project does not involve changes in existing land use from nonresidential to residential; and

    (2) The Project does not involve the demolition of one or more buildings containing the primary use served by the project that, together, have more than 20 percent of the square footage of the Project;

    (g) Projects for the acquisition, disposition, rehabilitation and/or modernization of 200,000 square feet or less of existing commercial space when all the following conditions are met:

    (n) Actions directly related to the provision of working capital, the acquisition of machinery and equipment or the purchase of inventory, raw materials or supplies.

    § 1815.111   Actions that require an environmental assessment.

#### § § 1815.111

Only those areas which are specifically relevant to the particular proposal should be addressed. Those areas should be addressed in as much detail as is necessary to allow an analysis of the alternatives and the proposal. The areas to be considered are the following:

    (1) Natural/ecological features (such as floodplain, wetlands, coastal zones, wildlife refuges, and endangered species);

    (2) Air quality;

    (3) Sound levels;

    (4) Water supply, wastewater treatment and water runoff;

    (5) Energy requirements and conservation;

    (6) Solid waste;

    (7) Transportation;

    (8) Community facilities and services;

    (9) Social and economic;

    (10) Historic and aesthetic; and

    (11) Other relevant factors.

    (d) If the Fund completes an environmental assessment and determines that an EIS is not required, then the Fund shall prepare a finding of no significant impact. The finding of no significant impact shall be made available to the public by the Fund as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6 of the CEQ regulations.

    § 1815.113   Public involvement.

#### § § 1815.114

    To ensure that at major decisionmaking points all relevant environmental concerns are considered by the Decisionmaker, the following procedures are established:
