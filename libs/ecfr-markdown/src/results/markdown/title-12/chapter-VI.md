        (c)  If you ask for records we have that another Federal agency originated, we will refer the request to the originating agency and tell you about the referral. If you should have sent your request to another Federal agency, we will refer the request to that agency and so advise you.

        § 602.6   FOIA exemptions.

#### § § 602.6

        The FOIA allows agencies to withhold documents in certain categories. For instance, we do not have to give you documents that relate to our examination of institutions or that would violate the personal privacy of an individual.

        (b)  When we receive a request for confidential business information, the FOIA Officer will promptly tell the requester and the business submitter in writing that the responsive records may be free from disclosure under the FOIA. We will give the business submitter a reasonable time to object to the proposed disclosure of the responsive records and tell the requester whenever:

        (1) The business submitter has in good faith labeled the information a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. We will provide such notice for 10 years after receiving the information unless the business submitter justifies the need for a longer period; or

        (2) We believe that disclosing the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the business submitter.

        (b) If estimated fees exceed $250.00 and you have a history of promptly paying fees charged for information requests, we may respond to your request based on your agreement to pay.

        (c) If estimated fees exceed $250.00 and you have no history of paying fees, we may require you to pay in advance.

        (d) If you have previously failed to pay fees for information requests or paid them late, you must pay any fees still owed, plus interest calculated under § 602.15, and the estimated fees before we will respond to a new or a pending request.

        (e) If we require advance payment or an advance agreement to pay, we will not consider your request to be received and will not respond to it until you meet the requirement.

        (b) If, in response to your request, the Chairman decides that an employee may testify, you must serve the employee with a subpoena under applicable Federal or State rules of procedure and at the same time send a copy of the subpoena by registered mail to the General Counsel.

        (c) Normally, depositions will be taken at the employee's office, at a time convenient to the employee and the FCA. FCA counsel may represent FCA's interests at the deposition.

#### § § 602.23

        (a) An employee served with a demand or a subpoena in a legal proceeding must immediately tell the General Counsel of such service, the testimony or documents described in the demand, and all relevant facts.

        (b) When the Chairman does not allow testimony or production of documents, FCA Counsel will provide the regulations in this subpart to the party or court issuing the demand and explain that the employee may not testify or produce documents without the Chairman's prior approval.

        (c) If the court rules the employee must comply with the demand regardless of the Chairman's instructions not to do so, the employee must respectfully refuse to comply.

        (d) FCA's decision under this subpart to comply or not to comply with any demand is not a waiver, an assertion of privilege, or an objection based on relevance, technical deficiency, or any other ground. We may oppose any demand on any legal ground.

#### § § 602.24

        If you are not an employee and are served with a demand or a subpoena in a legal proceeding directing you to produce or testify about an FCA report of examination, other document created or adopted by FCA, or any related document, you must object and immediately tell the General Counsel of such service, the testimony or documents described in the demand, and all relevant facts. You also must object to the production of any documents on the basis that they are FCA's property and cannot be released without FCA's consent. You should tell the requester the production of documents or testimony must follow the procedures in this part.

      Subpart E—Release of Records in Public Rulemaking Files

        § 602.25   General.

      § 603.355   Exemptions.

#### § § 603.355

      (a)  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes in the following systems of records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and from the provisions of this part:

      (b)  (1) In addition, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), investigatory materials compiled for criminal law enforcement in the system of records described in (b)(2) are exempt from all subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

      (i) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her would reveal investigative interest on the part of the OIG. This would enable record subjects to impede the investigation by, for example, destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, or fleeing the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.

      (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the Privacy Act.

      (iii) From subsection (d) because the records contained in this system relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to those records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

      (iv) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all information obtained.

      (v) From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations or duties.

      (vi) From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.

      (vii) From subsections (e)(4) (G), and (H), and (I), (e)(8), (f), (g) and (h) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act.

      § 605.501   Information Security Officer.

#### § § 605.501

      (a) The Information Security Officer of the Farm Credit Administration shall be responsible for implementation and oversight of the information security program and procedures adopted by the Agency pursuant to the Executive order. This officer shall be the recipient of questions, suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this program and shall be solely responsible for changes to it and for the assurance that it is at all times consistent with the Executive order and ISOO directive.

      (b) The Information Security Officer shall be the Farm Credit Administration's official contact for requests for declassification of materials submitted under the Executive order, regardless of the point of origin of such requests, and shall assure that such requests for records in the Farm Credit Administration's possession that were originated by another agency shall be forwarded to the originating agency. The Farm Credit Administration shall include a copy of the records requested together with its recommendation for action. Upon receipt, the originating agency shall process the request in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33(a)(2)(i). Upon request, the originating agency shall communicate its declassification determination to the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit Administration shall inform the requester of the determination within 1 year from the date of receipt, except in unusual circumstances. If an appeal is made on a denial of a mandatory declassification review request, the originating agency's appellate authority shall normally make a determination within 30 working days following the receipt of an appeal. If additional time is required to make a determination, the originating appellate authority shall notify the requester of the additional time needed and provide the requester with the reason for extension. The originating agency's appellate authority shall notify the requester in writing of the final determination and of the reasons for any denial. Such officer shall also assure that requests for declassification submitted under the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act.

      § 605.502   Program and procedures.

#### § § 605.502

      (a) The Farm Credit Administration has no authority for the original classification of information for national security purposes. Only those agencies described in the Executive order may so classify information.

      (b)  “Derivative classification” means the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or generating in new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply to the source information. Derivative classification includes the classification of information based on classification guidance. The duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification.

      (c)  “Mandatory declassification review” means the review for declassification of classified information in response to a request for declassification that meets the requirements under section 3.5 of the Executive order. All requests for review for declassification under the mandatory review provisions of the Executive order shall be handled by the Information Security Officer or his/her designee.

      (d)  All documents bearing the terms “Top Secret,” “Secret,” and “Confidential” shall be delivered to the Information Security Officer or his/her designee immediately upon receipt. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of such designees. In the event that the Information Security Officer or his/her designee is not available to receive such documents, they shall be sent to the FCA mailroom and stored in the combination safe and secured unopened until the Information Security Officer is available. Under no cirumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered be stored other than in the designated safe. All materials not immediately deliverable or able to be secured in the designated safe shall be returned to the sender, under appropriate cover, for redelivery to the FCA at the next earliest opportunity.

      (e)  Reproduction of classified materials shall take place only in accordance with section 4.2(g) of the Executive order and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies be made, they shall be subject to the same controls as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained by the Information Security Officer or his/her designee, and the log stored with the original documents. These measures shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of Mandatory Review.

      (f)  In accordance with 32 CFR 2001.43, all classified documents shall be stored in combination safes located at the primary headquarters and/or a Field Office, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration. The combinations shall be changed as required by directives issued by ISOO. The combinations shall be known only to the Information Security Officer and his/her designees who have appropriate security clearances.

      (g)  All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and shall be required to review the Executive order and appropriate ISOO directives.

      (h)  No official of the Farm Credit Administration shall use the terms “Top Secret”, “Secret”, or “Confidential” except in relation to materials classified for national security purposes. As a Federal regulatory agency, the Farm Credit Administration maintains certain internal documents that relate to its examination and supervision of the institutions of the Farm Credit System. Such documents are limited in use and distribution. Material that is of a sensitive nature to the Farm Credit Administration may be designated “Executive Document.”

      (i)  In accordance with 32 CFR 2003.20, the Farm Credit Administration requires that any person whose position requires access to classified information must execute a nondisclosure agreement on Standard Form 312—Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement. Persons not executing such nondisclosure agreements are subject to sanctions of Executive Order 13292. It is the policy of the Farm Credit Administration that any employee authorized access to classified information holds a personal responsibility for safeguarding against unlawful disclosures, and such employees are prohibited from disclosure without consent of the FCA Information Security Officer. Any such unauthorized disclosure will be reported to the Information Security Oversight Office, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and to any other Federal agency for which the Farm Credit Administration has access to classified information, as such reportings are subject to interpretation as required by statute and Executive order. Any employee who knowingly disclosed classified information or who refuses to cooperate with an investigation may be subject to mandatory administrative sanctions, including as a minimum, denial of further access to classified information. Further sanctions could include demotion or dismissal depending on the circumstances of a particular case.

      (j)  All inquiries regarding requests for classified information under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), including those from the news media, shall be referred to the FCA FOI Officer, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, Farm Credit Administration, and shall be handled in accordance with provisions of that statute and applicable regulations.

#### § § 606.649

      Except as otherwise provided in § 606.650, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

      § 606.650   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 606.650

      (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not:

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;

      (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) of this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. In preparing the report, the agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person(s) to be accommodated has an opportunity to provide relevant information. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section, and if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 5.15, 5.17 of the Farm Credit Act (12 U.S.C. 2250, 2252) and 12 U.S.C. 3025.

**Source:** Source: 58 FR 10942, Feb. 23, 1993, unless otherwise noted.

      § 607.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 607.1

      The regulations in part 607 implement the provisions of section 5.15 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, 12 U.S.C. 2001  (Act) relating to Farm Credit Administration (FCA) assessments. The regulations prescribe the procedures for the equitable apportionment of FCA annual administrative expenses and necessary reserves among Farm Credit System (System) institutions. Pursuant to section 5.15(a) of the Act, the regulations also provide for the separate assessment of the FCA's costs of supervising and examining the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC). The regulations further provide for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in performing statutorily required examinations of non-System entities.

      § 607.2   Definitions.

#### § § 607.2

      For the purpose of this part, the following definitions shall apply:

      (a)  means the annual amount to be paid by each System institution to the Farm Credit Administration in accordance with section 5.15 of the Act.

      (b)  means the average of the risk-adjusted asset base (as defined in § 615.5201 of this chapter) of banks, associations, and designated other System entities, calculated as follows:

      (1) For a bank, association, or designated other System entity with four quarters of risk-adjusted assets as of June 30 of each year, the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the last day of the quarter for the most recent four quarters immediately preceding each September 15, divided by four;

      (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, for a bank, association, or designated other System entity with less than four quarters of risk-adjusted assets as of June 30 of each year, the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the last day of the quarter for the quarters in which it was in existence immediately preceding September 15, divided by the number of quarters in which it was in existence immediately preceding September 15;

      (3) For a bank, association, or designated other System entity that is the continuing institution after a merger of existing institutions or a newly formed institution formed through a consolidation of existing institutions and that has less than four quarters of risk-adjusted assets as of June 30 of each year, the sum of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the last day of the quarter for the most recent four quarters immediately preceding September 15 for all the institutions that were merged or consolidated, divided by four;

      (4) For a bank, association, or designated other System entity chartered during the period July 1 through September 30 of each year that is not the continuing institution after a merger of existing institutions or a newly formed institution formed through a consolidation of existing institutions, the total of the average daily risk-adjusted assets as of the last day of the quarter ending September 30.

      (c)  means the composite numerical assessment of the financial condition of an institution assigned to the institution by the FCA based on its most recent examination of the institution. The FIRS factors are generally considered to be important indicators of an institution's financial health. Institutions are rated on each of the factors during an examination. The composite FIRS rating ranges from 1 to 5, with a lower number indicating a better financial condition than a higher number.

      (d)  means an amount owed to the FCA that has not been paid by the date specified in the FCA's Notice of Assessment or billing.

      (e)  means other System entities designated by the FCA in § 607.3(c) to be assessed on the same basis as banks and associations under § 607.3.

      (f)  means the expenses of the FCA attributable to the performance of examinations.

      (g)  means all FCA expenses that are not attributable to the performance of examinations.

      (h)  means the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, the National Cooperative Bank Development Corporation, and any other entity that is required to be examined, supervised, or otherwise regulated by the FCA that is not a System institution.

      (i)  means a written notice to each System institution showing the total amount assessed and owing, the fiscal year covered by the assessment, the amounts of installment payments, and the due dates for such payments. For banks, associations, and designated other System entities, the _Notice of Assessment_ shall also include an individualized assessment table showing the assessment under § 607.3(b)(2), where applicable.

      (j)  means any service corporation chartered under section 4.25 of the Act, the FAMC, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico, and any other entity statutorily designated as a System institution that is not a bank or association.

      (k)  means banks, associations, and other System entities.

      § 607.3   Assessment of banks, associations, and designated other System entities.

#### § § 607.3

      (a) Banks, associations, and other System entities designated in paragraph (c) of this section will be assessed annually pursuant to this section for funds to cover a portion of the FCA's administrative expenses and for such funds as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve. The total amount of the annual assessment of banks, associations, and designated other System entities shall be based on the FCA budget for each fiscal year plus such amount as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve, excluding amounts to be assessed against other System entities and reimbursements received from non-System entities.

      (b) The assessment shall be apportioned among the banks, associations, and designated other System entities as follows:

      (1) Thirty (30) percent of the assessment under this section shall be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System entity on the basis of each institution's pro rata share of the total average risk-adjusted asset base.

      (2) Seventy (70) percent of the assessment under this section shall be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System entity based upon the amounts of the institution's average risk-adjusted assets that fall within the graduated risk-adjusted asset tiers contained in the following table. An institution's total assessment under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts assessed for risk-adjusted assets falling into each applicable tier, subject to adjustment for its FIRS rating as required in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The same assessment rate (designated as X or a declining percentage of X in the following table) will be applied to each dollar value of risk-adjusted assets falling within each tier, increased where applicable, by the amounts prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The actual assessment rate under this paragraph shall be determined annually based on relative average risk-adjusted asset bases, the FIRS ratings of individual institutions, and the FCA budget as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but the relationship between the rates applied to each tier shall remain constant as set forth in the following table.

      (i) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other System entity a composite FIRS rating of 3 following its most recent examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, the assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be increased by 20 percent.

      (ii) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other System entity a composite FIRS rating of 4 or 5 following its most recent examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, the assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be increased by 40 percent.

      (iii) Banks, associations, and designated other System entities that were formed through mergers or consolidations and have not been examined before their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to have a composite FIRS rating equivalent to the best composite FIRS rating assigned to the merged or consolidated institutions in the FCA's most recent examination of the individual institutions prior to the date of merger or consolidation. Newly chartered institutions not formed through mergers or consolidations that have not been examined before their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to have a composite FIRS rating of 2.

      (3) Each bank, association, and designated other System entity shall pay a minimum assessment of $20,000 regardless of the result of the application of the assessment formula established by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. If such a minimum assessment is apportioned to an institution, that institution's average risk-adjusted asset base shall be deducted from the total average risk-adjusted asset base, and $20,000 shall be deducted from the total assessment amount for purposes of determining the assessments of banks, associations, and designated other System entities paying more than the $20,000 minimum assessment.

      (c) Other System entities designated to be assessed in accordance with this section are:

      The Farm Credit Services Leasing Corporation.

      (d) Assessments may be adjusted periodically to reflect:

      (1) Changes in the FCA budget and necessary reserve; and

      (2) Any overpayment or underpayment by a bank, association, or designated other System entity in the prior fiscal year.

      § 607.4   Assessment of other System entities.

#### § § 607.4

      (a)(1) Unless otherwise designated to be assessed under § 607.3, and with the exception of FAMC as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, other System entities will be assessed for estimated direct expenses plus an allocated portion of FCA indirect expenses and such amount as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve. The estimate for direct expenses shall take into account the direct expenses incurred in the most recent examination of the entity preceding each September 15 and expected increases or decreases in examination work for the next fiscal year. A proportional amount of FCA indirect expenses will be allocated to each entity based on the estimated direct expenses related to the particular entity as a percentage of the total budgeted direct expenses of the agency (excluding direct expenses under paragraph (b) of this section) for the fiscal year covered by the assessment.

      (2) Assessments of other System entities under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be adjusted periodically to reflect:

      (i) Changes in the FCA budget and necessary reserve; and

      (ii) Any overpayment or underpayment by such other System entity in the prior fiscal year.

      (b)  The FCA shall assess FAMC for the estimated cost of FCA's regulation, supervision, and examination of FAMC, including reasonably related administrative and overhead expenses. FAMC's assessment may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the FCA budget and to reconcile differences between FAMC's assessment and FCA's actual expenditures for regulation of FAMC in the prior fiscal year.

      § 607.5   Notice of assessment.

#### § § 607.5

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, prior to September 15 of each year, the FCA shall determine the amount of assessment to be collected from each System institution for the next fiscal year under §§ 607.3 and 607.4 and shall provide each System institution with a Notice of Assessment. The total amount assessed each System institution in the Notice of Assessment shall be an obligation of each institution on October 1 of each fiscal year. The total amount assessed each System institution shall be payable not less often than quarterly in equal installments during each fiscal year, subject to adjustment pursuant to §§ 607.3(d), 607.4(a)(2), 607.4(b), and 607.10.

      (b) For banks, associations and designated other System entities chartered during the period July 1 through September 30 of each year, the FCA shall, prior to December 15, determine the amount of assessment to be collected from each such institution for the remainder of the fiscal year and provide the institution with a Notice of Assessment. The total amount of the assessment becomes an obligation of the institution on January 1 and shall be payable in equal installments, subject to adjustment pursuant to §§ 607.3(d) and 607.10, not less often than quarterly for the remainder of the fiscal year. The first installment shall be due on January 1. This paragraph shall not apply to banks, associations, and designated other System entities formed by merger, consolidation, or transfer of direct lending authority.

      (c) In the event of the proposed cancellation of the charter of a System institution, the unpaid installments of the total amount of the institution's assessment shall be provided for prior to the cancellation of the charter.

      § 607.6   Payment of assessment.

#### § § 607.6

      (a) System institutions shall pay the amounts due as scheduled in the FCA Notice of Assessment. Payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) for credit to the FCA's account in the Department of the Treasury, by check to the FCA for deposit, or by such other means as the FCA may authorize.

      (b) Payments made by EFT that are not received by the close of business on the due date shall be considered delinquent in accordance with § 607.7.

      (c) Payments made by check that are not received by the FCA before the close of business on the third workday preceding the due date shall be considered delinquent in accordance with § 607.7.

      § 607.7   Late-payment charges on assessments.

#### § § 607.7

      (a) If any portion of a scheduled installment of a System institution's total assessment or the reimbursement billed to a non-System entity is not paid by the due date, the overdue amount shall be considered delinquent.

      (b) Delinquent amounts shall be charged late-payment interest at the United States Treasury Department's current value of funds rate published in the  Late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate of interest and shall accrue on a daily basis starting on the due date of the delinquent amount and continuing through the date payment is received by the FCA.

      (c) The FCA shall waive the collection of interest on the delinquent amounts if such amounts are paid within 30 days of the date interest begins to accrue. The FCA may waive interest due on delinquent amounts upon finding no fault with the performance of the remitter.

      (d) The FCA shall charge an amount necessary to cover the administrative costs incurred as a result of collection of any delinquent amount.

      (e) The FCA shall charge a penalty of 6 percent per annum on any portion of a delinquent amount that is more than 90 days past due. Such penalty shall accrue from the date the amount became delinquent.

      § 607.8   Reimbursements for services to non-System entities.

#### § § 607.8

      Non-System entities shall be assessed for direct expenses plus an amount for FCA indirect expenses reasonably related to the services rendered to the non-System entity. Such related indirect expenses shall be calculated as a percentage of the FCA's overall indirect expenses based on the extent of FCA activities with respect to the non-System entity during the period since the entity's most recent assessment.

      § 607.9   Reimbursable billings.

#### § § 607.9

      The FCA shall bill the amounts due for services to non-System entities each year subsequent to the issuance of their respective Reports of Examination. Amounts billed are due in full within 30 days from the date billed. If the billed amount or any portion thereof remains unpaid at close of business on the due date, such amount or portion shall be considered delinquent in accordance with § 607.7.

      § 607.10   Adjustments for overpayment or underpayment of assessments.

#### § § 607.10

      Where adjustments for overpayment or underpayment of assessments are made pursuant to §§ 607.3(d), 607.4(a)(2), and 607.4(b), credits for overpayments or charges for underpayments shall be based on FCA administrative operating expenses incurred in the applicable fiscal year and on funds required to be maintained pursuant to section 5.15 of the Act. Such credits or charges shall be applied to the next applicable assessment payment due during the current or subsequent fiscal year. Where such adjustments are made, the FCA shall provide the institution with a statement of adjustment at least 15 days prior to the date when the institution's next assessment payment is due. Adjustments in assessments shall be made in principal amount only. Overdue amounts under § 607.7 are not underpayments for assessment adjustment purposes.

      § 607.11   Report of assessments and expenses.

#### § § 607.11

#### § § 608.805

        (a) The collection of claims shall be aggressively pursued in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, the joint regulations issued under that Act, and these regulations. Debts owed to the United States, together with charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs, should be collected in one lump sum unless otherwise provided by law. If a debtor requests installment payments, the debtor, as requested by the FCA, shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the debtor is unable to pay the debt in one lump sum. When appropriate, the FCA shall arrange an installment payment schedule. Claims which cannot be collected directly or by administrative offset shall be either written off as administratively uncollectible or referred to the General Counsel for further consideration.

        (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the FCA, where the claim (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) does not exceed $100,000.

        (a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals should normally be made upon a debtor, unless a response or other information indicates that additional written demands would either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demands may be preceded by other appropriate actions under Federal law, including immediate referral for litigation and/or administrative offset.

        (b) The initial demand for payment shall be in writing and shall inform the debtor of the following:

        (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;

        (2) The payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment;

        (3) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection is impractical. The debtor shall be informed that the debtor may be assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with § 608.807;

        (4) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of the FCA's determination of indebtedness;

        (5) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency;

        (6) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date;

        (7) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or has not paid the debt by the payment due date, the FCA intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset;

        (8) The name and address of the FCA official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and

        (9) Other information, as may be appropriate.

        (c) If, prior to, during, or after completion of the demand cycle, the FCA determines to collect the debt by either administrative or salary offset, the FCA shall follow, as applicable, the requirements for a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset set forth in § 608.822.

        (d) If no response to the initial demand for payment is received by the payment due date, the FCA shall take further action under this part, under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, under the joint regulations (4 CFR parts 101-105), or under any other applicable State or Federal law. These actions may include reports to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of contracts, debarment, and salary or administrative offset.

        § 608.807   Right to inspect and copy records.

#### § § 608.807

        The debtor may inspect and copy the FCA records related to the claim. The debtor shall give the FCA reasonable advance notice that it intends to inspect and copy the records involved. The debtor shall pay copying costs unless they are waived by the FCA. Copying costs shall be assessed pursuant to §§ 602.11 and 602.12 of this chapter.

        § 608.808   Right to offer to repay claim.

#### § § 608.808

        (a) The debtor may offer to enter into a written agreement with the FCA to repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an offer and the decision to enter into such a written agreement is at the discretion of the FCA.

        (b) If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because payment of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the FCA shall analyze the debtor's financial condition. The FCA may enter into a written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to repay the debt in installments if the FCA determines, in its sole discretion, that payment of the amount due would create an undue financial hardship for the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth the amount and frequency of installment payments and shall, in accordance with § 608.812, provide for the imposition of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the FCA.

        (c) The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750. The FCA shall provide the debtor with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation. The statement shall recite that the written explanation was read and understood before execution of the note and that the debtor signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Documentation of these procedures will be maintained in the FCA's file on the debtor.

        § 608.809   Right to agency review.

#### § § 608.809

        (a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a review of the FCA's determination of the existence of the debt or of the amount of the debt. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.

        (b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request for review to the FCA official named in the initial demand letter, within 15 calendar days after receipt of the letter. The debtor's request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed.

        (c) The FCA shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the FCA has received the request for review. The FCA shall conduct its review of the claim in accordance with § 608.810.

        (d) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the FCA shall notify the debtor whether the FCA's determination of the existence or amount of the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to § 608.810(e). If the FCA's determination is sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that the FCA intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset.

        § 608.810   Review procedures.

#### § § 608.810

        (a) Unless an oral hearing is required by § 608.823(d), the FCA's review shall be a review of the written record of the claim.

        (b) If an oral hearing is required under § 608.823(d), the FCA shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for such a hearing. The oral hearing, however, shall not be an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of a formal evidentiary hearing. All significant matters discussed at the hearing, however, will be carefully documented.

        (c) Any review required by this part, whether a review of the written record or an oral hearing, shall be conducted by a hearing official. In the case of a salary offset, the hearing official shall not be under the supervision or control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration.

        (d) The FCA may be represented by legal counsel. The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of the debtor's choice and at the debtor's expense.

        (e) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision based on documentary evidence and, if applicable, information developed at an oral hearing. The written decision shall be issued as soon as practicable after the review but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for review was received by the FCA, unless the debtor requests a delay in the proceedings. A delay in the proceedings shall be granted if the hearing official determines, in his or her sole discretion, that there is good cause to grant the delay. If a delay is granted, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the review was postponed.

        (f) Upon issuance of the written opinion, the FCA shall promptly notify the debtor of the hearing official's decision. Said notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

        § 608.811   Special review.

#### § § 608.811

        (a) An employee subject to salary offset, under subpart C of this part, or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the FCA of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.

        (b) To determine whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:

        (1) Income from all sources;

        (2) Assets;

        (3) Liabilities;

        (4) Number of dependents;

        (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;

        (6) Medical expenses; and

        (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.

        (c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.

        (d) The FCA shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an undue financial hardship on the employee. The FCA shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.

        § 608.812   Charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties.

#### § § 608.812

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the FCA shall:

        (1) Assess interest on unpaid claims;

        (2) Assess administrative costs incurred in processing and handling overdue claims; and

        (3) Assess penalty charges not to exceed 6 percent a year on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due. The imposition of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.

        (b)(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment or the Notice of Intent to Collect by either Administrative or Salary Offset if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand or notice.

        (2) The 30-day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the FCA reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Interest shall only accrue on the principal of the claim and the interest rate shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in cases where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, or if the FCA reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States.

        (c) If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the FCA may assess a new interest rate on the unpaid claim. In addition, charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties which accrued but were not collected under the original repayment agreement shall be added to the principal of the claim to be paid under the new repayment agreement. Interest shall accrue on the entire principal balance of the claim, as adjusted to reflect any increase resulting from the addition of these charges.

        (d) The FCA may waive charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties if it determines that:

        (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim within a reasonable period of time;

        (2) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim;

        (3) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, or penalties would be against equity and good conscience; or

        (4) It is otherwise in the best interest of the United States, including the situation where an installment payment agreement or offset is in effect.

        § 608.813   Contracting for collection services.

#### § § 608.813

        The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may contract for collection services in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718 and 4 CFR 102.6 to recover debts.

        § 608.814   Reporting of credit information.

#### § § 608.814

        The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information that an individual is responsible for a debt owed to the United States. Information will be disclosed to reporting agencies in accordance with the terms and conditions of agreements entered into between the FCA and the reporting agencies. The terms and conditions of such agreements shall specify that all of the rights and protection afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been fulfilled. The FCA shall notify each consumer reporting agency, to which a claim was disclosed, when the debt has been satisfied.

        § 608.815   Credit report.

#### § § 608.815

        In order to aid the FCA in making appropriate determinations regarding the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties; the use of administrative offset; the use of other collection methods; and the likelihood of collecting the claim, the FCA may institute, consistent with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681, ), a credit investigation of the debtor immediately following a determination that the claim exists.

      Subpart B—Administrative Offset

        § 608.820   Applicability.

#### § § 608.820

        (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to the collection of debts by administrative [or salary] offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, or other statutory or common law.

        (b) Offset shall not be used to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility of discovering and collecting such debt.

        (c) Offset shall not be used with respect to:

        (1) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government;

        (2) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or tariff laws of the United States; or

        (3) Any case in which collection by offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.

        (d) Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 or 5 U.S.C. 5514 may be collected by offset if such collection is authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.

        § 608.821   Collection by offset.

#### § § 608.821

        (a) Collection of a debt by administrative [or salary] offset shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, of 4 CFR 102.3, and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. It is not necessary for the debt to be reduced to judgment or to be undisputed for offset to be used.

        (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may determine that it is feasible to collect a debt to the United States by offset against funds payable to the debtor.

        (c) The feasibility of collecting a debt by offset will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This determination shall be made by considering all relevant factors, including the following:

        (1) The degree to which the offset can be accomplished in accordance with law. This determination should take into consideration relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements;

        (2) The degree to which the FCA is certain that its determination of the existence and amount of the debt is correct;

        (3) The practicality of collecting the debt by offset. The cost, in time and money, of collecting the debt by offset and the amount of money which can reasonably be expected to be recovered through offset will be relevant to this determination; and

        (4) Whether the use of offset will substantially interfere with or defeat the purpose of a program authorizing payments against which the offset is contemplated. For example, under a grant program in which payments are made in advance of the grantee's performance, the imposition of offset against such a payment may be inappropriate.

        (d) The collection of a debt by offset may not be feasible when there are circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood of collection by offset is less than probable.

        (e) The offset will be effected 31 days after the debtor receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset (or Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset if the offset is a salary offset), or upon the expiration of a stay of offset, unless the FCA determines under § 608.824 that immediate action is necessary.

        (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt, amounts recovered through offset may be applied to them in any order. Applicable statutes of limitation would be considered before applying the amounts recovered to any debts owed.

        § 608.822   Notice requirements before offset.

#### § § 608.822

        (a) Except as provided in § 608.824, the FCA will provide the debtor with 30 calendar days' written notice that unpaid debt amounts shall be collected by administrative [or salary] offset (Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset) before the FCA imposes offset against any money that is to be paid to the debtor.

        (b) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset shall be delivered to the debtor by hand or by mail and shall provide the following information:

        (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;

        (2) In the case of an administrative offset, the payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice;

        (3) In the case of a salary offset: (i) The FCA's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full; and

        (ii) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;

        (4) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the FCA related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection is impractical. The debtor shall be informed that the debtor shall be assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with § 608.807;

        (5) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of, and to request a hearing, on the FCA's determination of indebtedness, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and, in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period). The debtor shall be informed that to obtain a review, the debtor shall deliver a written request for a review to the FCA official named in the Notice, within 15 calendar days after the debtor's receipt of the Notice. In the case of a salary offset, the debtor shall also be informed that the review shall be conducted by an official arranged for by the FCA who shall be a hearing official not under the control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, or an administrative law judge;

        (6) That the filing of a petition for hearing within 15 calendar days after receipt of the Notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

        (7) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the written request for review unless the employee requests, and the hearing official grants, a delay in the proceedings;

        (8) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written agreement with the FCA to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the FCA;

        (9) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs shall be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date. The debtor shall be informed that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104);

        (10) The amount of accrued interest and the amount of any other penalties or administrative costs which may have been added to the principal debt;

        (11) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or has not paid the debt prior to the date on which the offset is to be imposed, the FCA intends to collect the debt by administrative [or salary] offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset. The debtor shall be informed that the offset shall be imposed against any funds that might become available to the debtor, until the principal debt and all accumulated interest and other charges are paid in full;

        (12) The date on which the offset will be imposed, which shall be 31 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice. The debtor shall be informed that the FCA reserves the right to impose an offset prior to this date if the FCA determines that immediate action is necessary;

        (13) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the debtor to:

        (i) Penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority;

        (ii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; and, with regard to employees,

        (iii) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code; part 752 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or any other applicable statute or regulation;

        (14) The name and address of the FCA official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt or the offset;

        (15) Any other rights and remedies available to the debtor under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made;

        (16) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt, which are later waived or found not owed to the United States, will be promptly refunded to the employee; and

        (17) Other information, as may be appropriate.

        (c) When the procedural requirements of this section have been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, the FCA is not required to duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.

        § 608.823   Right to review of claim.

#### § § 608.823

        (a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a review of the FCA's determination of the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment schedule. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.

        (b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request for review to the FCA official named in the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice. The debtor's written request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed and shall specify whether the debtor requests an oral hearing or a review of the written record of the claim. If an oral hearing is requested, the debtor shall explain in the request why the matter cannot be resolved by a review of the documentary evidence alone.

        (c) The FCA shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the FCA has received the request for review. The FCA shall conduct its review of the claim in accordance with § 608.810.

        (d) The FCA's review of the claim, under this section, shall include providing the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing if:

        (1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the FCA to consider waiver of the indebtedness, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or

        (2) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the FCA determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

        (e) A debtor waives the right to a hearing and will have his or her debt offset in accordance with the proposed offset schedule if the debtor:

        (1) Fails to file a written request for review within the timeframe set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the FCA determines that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control; or

        (2) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified unless the hearing official determines that the failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

        (f) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the FCA shall notify the debtor whether the FCA's determination of the existence or amount of the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official, pursuant to § 608.810(e). If the FCA's determination is sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that the FCA intends to collect the debt by offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt.

        (g) When the procedural requirements of this section have been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, the FCA is not required to duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.

        § 608.824   Waiver of procedural requirements.

#### § § 608.824

        (a) The FCA may impose offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by this part, if:

        (1) Failure to impose the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and

        (2) The timing of the payment against which the offset will be imposed does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures.

        (b) The procedures required by this part shall be complied with promptly after the offset is imposed. Amounts recovered by offset, which are later found not to be owed to the Government, shall be promptly refunded to the debtor.

        § 608.825   Coordinating offset with other Federal agencies.

#### § § 608.825

        (a)(1) Any creditor agency which requests the FCA to impose an offset against amounts owed to the debtor shall submit to the FCA a claim certification which meets the requirements of this paragraph. The FCA shall submit the same certification to any agency that the FCA requests to effect an offset.

        (2) The claim certification shall be in writing. It shall certify the debtor owes the debt and that all of the applicable requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. If the intended offset is to be a salary offset, a claim certification shall instead certify that the debtor owes the debt and that the applicable requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.

        (3) A certification that the debtor owes the debt shall state the amount of the debt, the factual basis supporting the determination of indebtedness, and the date on which payment of the debt was due. A certification that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent. A certification that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent.

        (b)(1) The FCA shall not effect an offset requested by another Federal agency without first obtaining the claim certification required by paragraph (a) of this section. If the FCA receives an incomplete claim certification, the FCA shall return the claim certification with notice that a claim certification which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the FCA before the FCA will consider effecting an offset.

        (2) The FCA may rely on the information contained in the claim certification provided by a requesting creditor agency. The FCA is not authorized to review a creditor agency's determination of indebtedness.

        (c) Only the creditor agency may agree to enter into an agreement with the debtor for the repayment of the claim. Only the creditor agency may agree to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection of the claim.

        (d) The FCA may decline, for good cause, a request by another agency to effect an offset. Good cause includes that the offset might disrupt, directly or indirectly, essential FCA operations. The refusal and the reasons shall be sent in writing to the creditor agency.

        § 608.826   Stay of offset.

#### § § 608.826

        (a)(1) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's request for inspection of agency records, the offset is stayed for 10 calendar days beyond the date set for the record inspection.

        (2) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's offer to enter into a repayment agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified as to whether the proposed agreement is acceptable.

        (3) When a review is conducted, the offset is stayed until the creditor agency issues a final written decision.

        (b) When offset is stayed, the amount of the debt and the amount of any accrued interest or other charges will be withheld from payments to the debtor. The withheld amounts shall not be applied against the debt until the stay expires. If withheld funds are later determined not to be subject to offset, they will be promptly refunded to the debtor.

        (c) If the FCA is the creditor agency and the offset is stayed, the FCA will immediately notify an offsetting agency to withhold the payment pending termination of the stay.

        § 608.827   Offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

#### § § 608.827

        The FCA may request that monies payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset to collect debts owed to the FCA by the debtor. The FCA must certify that the debtor owes the debt, the amount of the debt, and that the FCA has complied with the requirements set forth in this part, 4 CFR 102.3, and the Office of Personnel Management regulations. The request shall be submitted to the official designated in the Office of Personnel Management regulations to receive the request.

      Subpart C—Offset Against Salary

        § 608.835   Purpose.

#### § § 608.835

        The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365)(5 U.S.C. 5514), which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offsets. These regulations provide procedures for the collection of a debt owed to the Government by the imposition of a salary offset against amounts payable to a Federal employee as salary. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Since salary offset is a type of administrative offset, this subpart supplements subpart B.

        § 608.836   Applicability of regulations.

#### § § 608.836

        (a) These regulations apply to the following cases:

        (1) Where the FCA is owed a debt by an individual currently employed by another agency;

        (2) Where the FCA is owed a debt by an individual who is currently employed by the FCA; or

        (3) Where the FCA currently employs an individual who owes a debt to another Federal agency. Upon receipt of proper certification from the creditor agency, the FCA will offset the debtor-employee's salary in accordance with these regulations.

        (b) These regulations do not apply to the following:

        (1) Debts or claims rising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).

        (2) Any adjustment to pay arising from an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.

        (3) A claim which has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the creditor agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts.

        § 608.837   Definitions.

#### § § 608.837

        In this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:

        (1) An executive agency as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, including the United States Postal Service and the United States Postal Rate Commission;

        (2) A military department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102;

        (3) An agency or court of the judicial branch, including a court as defined in 28 U.S.C. 610, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation;

        (4) An agency of the legislative branch, including the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives; or

        (5) Other independent establishments that are entities of the Federal Government.

        (b)  means, for an officially established pay interval, that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay, remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld. The FCA shall allow the deductions described in 5 CFR 581.105 (b) through (f).

        (c)  means a current employee of the FCA or other agency, including a current member of the Armed Forces or Reserve of the Armed Forces of the United States.

        (d)  means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, or nonrecovery of a debt allegedly owed by an employee to the FCA or another agency as permitted or required by 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or any other law.

        § 608.838   Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office.

#### § § 608.838

        (a) The regulations contained in this subpart do not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the General Accounting Office.

        (b) These regulations also do not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.

        § 608.839   Procedures for salary offset.

#### § § 608.839

        (a) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount to be deducted from the employee's disposable pay at regular pay intervals.

        (b) Deductions shall begin within three official pay periods following the date of mailing or delivery of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset.

        (c)(1) If the amount of the debt is equal to or is less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt should be collected in one lump-sum deduction.

        (2) If the amount of the debt is not collected in one lump-sum deduction, the debt shall be collected in installment deductions over a period of time not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for that period, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.

        (3) A deduction exceeding the 15-percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.

        (4) Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the FCA and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCA may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.

        (d) In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets against current employees of the FCA or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the FCA, at its discretion, may determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15-percent limitation. Debts owed to the FCA should generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies.

        § 608.840   Refunds.

#### § § 608.840

        (a) In instances where the FCA is the creditor agency, it shall promptly refund any amounts deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 when:

        (1) The debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulations); or

        (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the FCA to make a refund.

        (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section shall not bear interest.

        § 608.841   Requesting current paying agency to offset salary.

#### § § 608.841

        (a) To request a paying agency to impose a salary offset against amounts owed to the debtor, the FCA shall provide the paying agency with a claim certification which meets the requirements set forth in § 608.825(a). The FCA shall also provide the paying agency with a repayment schedule determined under the provisions of § 608.839 or in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the debtor.

        (b) If the employee separates from the paying agency before the debt is paid in full, the paying agency shall certify the total amount collected on the debt. A copy of this certification shall be sent to the employee and a copy shall be sent to the FCA. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the FCA must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.

        (c) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the FCA is not required to repeat the due process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part to resume the collection. The FCA shall, however, review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

        (d) If a special review is conducted pursuant to § 608.811 and results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the FCA shall provide a new claim certification to the paying agency.

        § 608.842   Responsibility of the FCA as the paying agency.

#### § § 608.842

        (a) When the FCA receives a claim certification from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The FCA shall send the debtor written notice which provides:

        (1) That the FCA has received a valid claim certification from the creditor agency;

        (2) The date on which salary offset will begin;

        (3) The amount of the debt; and

        (4) The amount of such deductions.

        (b) If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim certification to the FCA, the employee transfers to a different agency before the debt is collected in full, the FCA must certify the total amount collected on the debt. The FCA shall send a copy of this certification to the creditor agency and a copy to the employee. If the FCA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it shall provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount).

        § 608.843   Nonwaiver of rights by payments.

#### § § 608.843

        An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under this subpart shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provisions of a written contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

        § 609.905   In general.

#### § § 609.905

        Farm Credit System (System) institutions must engage in appropriate risk management practices to ensure safety and soundness of their operations. A System institution's board and management must maintain and document effective policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate cyber risks. This includes establishing an appropriate vulnerability management program to monitor cyber threats, mitigate any known vulnerabilities, and establish appropriate reporting mechanisms to the institution's board and the Farm Credit Administration (FCA).

        (ii) Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, internal controls, and other practices in place to mitigate risks.

        (2) Identify systems and software vulnerabilities, prioritize the vulnerabilities and the affected systems based on risk, and perform timely remediation. The particular security measures an institution adopts will depend upon the size, risk profile, and complexity of the institution's operations and activities.

        (3) Maintain an incident response plan that contains procedures the institution must implement when it suspects or detects unauthorized access to current, former, or potential customer, employee, or other sensitive or confidential information. An institution's incident response plan must be reviewed and updated periodically, but at least annually, to address new threats, concerns, and evolving technology. The incident response plan must contain procedures for:

        (i) Assessing the nature and scope of an incident, and identifying what information systems and types of information have been accessed or misused;

        (ii) Acting to contain the incident while preserving records and other evidence;

        (iii) Resuming business activities during intrusion response;

        (iv) Notifying the institution's board of directors when the institution learns of an incident involving unauthorized access to or use of sensitive or confidential customer, and/or employee information, or unauthorized access to financial institution information including proprietary information;

        (v) Notifying FCA as soon as possible or no later than 36 hours after the institution determines that an incident has occurred; and

        (vi) Notifying former, current, or potential customers and employees and known visitors to your website of an incident when warranted, and in accordance with state and federal laws.

        (4) Describe the plan to train employees, vendors, contractors, and the institution board to implement the institution's cyber risk program.

        (5) Include policies for vendor management and oversight. Each institution, at a minimum, must:

        (i) Exercise appropriate due diligence in selecting vendors;

        (ii) Negotiate contract provisions, when feasible, that facilitate effective risk management and oversight and specify the expectations and obligations of both parties;

        (iii) Conduct a vendor risk assessment on all vendors; and

        (iv) Monitor its IT and cyber risk management related vendors to ensure they have satisfied agreed upon expectations and deliverables. Monitoring may include reviewing audits, summaries of test results, or other equivalent evaluations of its vendors.

        (6) Maintain robust internal controls by regularly testing the key controls, systems, and procedures of the cyber risk management program.

        (i) The frequency and nature of such tests are to be determined by the institution's risk assessment.

        (ii) Tests must be conducted or reviewed by independent third parties or staff independent of those who develop or maintain the cyber risk management program.

        (iii) Internal systems and controls must provide reasonable assurances that System institutions will prevent, detect, and remediate material deficiencies on a timely basis.

        (d)  Institutions must consider privacy and other legal compliance issues, including but not limited to, the privacy and security of System institution information; current, former, and potential borrower information; and employee information, as well as compliance with statutory requirements for the use of electronic media.

        (e)  At a minimum, each institution must report quarterly to its board or an appropriate committee of the board. The report must contain material matters related to the institution's cyber risk management program, including specific risks and threats.

        § 609.935   Business planning.

#### § § 609.935

        The annually approved business plan required under subpart J of part 618 of this chapter, and § 652.60 of this chapter for System institutions and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, respectively, must include a technology plan that, at a minimum:

        (a) Describes the institution's intended technology goals, performance measures, and objectives;

        (b) Details the technology budget;

        (c) Identifies and assesses the adequacy of the institution's entire cyber risk management program, including proposed technology changes;

      Subpart D—General Requirements for Electronic Communications

        § 609.950   Electronic communications.

#### § § 609.950

        (a)  In accordance with E-SIGN, System institutions may communicate electronically in business, consumer, or commercial transactions. E-commerce transactions require the agreement of all parties when you do business.

        (b)  E-SIGN and Federal Reserve Board Regulations B, M, and Z (12 CFR parts 202, 213, and 226) outline specific disclosure requirements for communications with consumers.

        (c)  The consumer disclosure requirements of E-SIGN and of Federal Reserve Board Regulation B (12 CFR part 202) do not apply to your communications with parties other than consumers. (Federal Reserve Board Regulations M and Z (12 CFR parts 213 and 226) apply to consumers only.) Nonetheless, you must ensure that your communications, including those disclosures required under the Act and the regulations in this part, demonstrate good business practices in the delivery of credit and closely related services and in your obtaining goods and services.

        (2)  Stockholder-elected directors must constitute at least 60 percent of the members of each institution's board.

        (i) Each Farm Credit bank must have at least two outside directors.

        (ii) Associations with total assets exceeding $500 million as of January 1 of each year must have no fewer than two outside directors on the board. However, this requirement does not apply if it causes the percent of stockholder-elected directors to be less than 75 percent of the board.

        (iii) Associations with $500 million or less in total assets as of January 1 of each year must have at least one outside director.

        (3)  Banks and associations may not establish a different term of office for outside directors than that established for stockholder-elected directors.

        (b)  Each institution must establish and maintain procedures for removal of outside directors. When the removal of an outside director is sought before the expiration of the outside director's term, the reason for removal must be documented. An institution's director removal procedures must allow for removal of an outside director by a majority vote of all voting stockholders voting, in person or by proxy, or by a two-thirds majority vote of the full board of directors.

        § 611.320   Impartiality in the election of directors.

#### § § 611.320

        (a) Each Farm Credit institution shall adopt policies and procedures that are designed to assure that the elections of board members are conducted in an impartial manner.

        (b) No employee or agent of a Farm Credit institution shall take any part, directly or indirectly, in the nomination or election of members to the board of directors of a Farm Credit institution, or make any statement, either orally or in writing, which may be construed as intended to influence any vote in such nominations, or elections. This paragraph shall not prohibit employees or agents from providing biographical and other similar information or engaging in other activities pursuant to policies and procedures for nominations and elections. This paragraph does not affect the right of an employee or agent to nominate or vote for stockholder-elected directors of an institution in which the employee or agent is a voting member.

        (c) No property, facilities, or resources, including information technology and human or financial resources, of any Farm Credit institution shall be used by any candidate for nomination or election or by any other person for the benefit of any candidate for nomination or election, unless the same property, facilities, or resources are simultaneously available and made known to be available for use by all declared candidates, including floor nominees. For the limited purpose of Farm Credit bank board elections, each Farm Credit bank may allow its stockholder-associations to use stockholder-association property, facilities, or resources in support of bank director candidates. Any Farm Credit bank permitting this activity by its stockholder-associations must have a policy in place approved by its board of directors establishing reasonable standards that stockholder-associations must follow, and those standards must give appropriate consideration to the various sizes of stockholder-associations within a bank's district and include a maximum amount that a stockholder-association may expend in support of a bank director candidate.

        (d) No director, employee, or agent of a Farm Credit institution shall, for the purpose of furthering the interests of any candidates for nomination or election, furnish or make use of records that are not made available for use by all declared candidates.

        (e) No Farm Credit institution may in any way distribute or mail, whether at the expense of the institution or another, any campaign materials for director candidates. Institutions may request biographical information, as well as the disclosure information required under § 611.330, from all declared candidates who certify that they are eligible, restate such information in a standard format, and distribute or mail it with ballots or proxy ballots.

        (f) No director of a Farm Credit institution shall, in his or her capacity as a director, make any statement, either orally or in writing, which may be construed as intending to influence any vote in that institution's director nominations or elections. This paragraph shall not prohibit director candidates from engaging in campaign activities on their own behalf.

        § 611.325   Bank and association nominating committees.

#### § § 611.325

        Each Farm Credit bank and association may have only one nominating committee in any one election cycle. Each Farm Credit bank and association's board of directors must establish and maintain policies and procedures on its nominating committee, describing the formation, composition, operation, resources, and duties of the committee, consistent with current laws and regulations. Each nominating committee must conduct itself in the impartial manner prescribed by the policies and procedures adopted by its institution under § 611.320 and this section.

        (a)  The voting stockholders of each bank and association must elect a nominating committee of no fewer than three members. Unless prohibited by association bylaws, out-of-territory borrowers who hold voting stock may serve as members of an association's nominating committee. If an association's bylaws prohibit it, that association must inform, in writing and at the time of loanmaking, each out-of-territory borrower that out-of-territory borrowers may not serve on the association's nominating committee.

        (b)  Farm Credit banks and associations may use in-person (including use of an online medium and proxy ballots) or mail balloting procedures to elect a nominating committee.

        (1) Farm Credit banks and associations must provide voting stockholders the opportunity to vote on the candidates for each nominating committee position.

        (2) Association nominating committee members may only be elected to a 1-year term. Farm Credit Banks must use weighted voting, with no cumulative voting permitted, when electing members to serve on a nominating committee. Farm Credit banks and associations may permit nominating committee members to be re-nominated and stand for re-election to serve successive terms.

        (c)  No individual may serve on a nominating committee who, at the time of election to, or during service on, a nominating committee, is an employee, director, or agent of that bank or association. A nominating committee member may not be a candidate for election to the board in the same election for which the committee is identifying nominees. A nominating committee member may resign from the committee to run for election to the board only if the individual did not attend any nominating committee meeting.

        (d)  It is the responsibility of each nominating committee to identify, evaluate, and nominate candidates for stockholder election to a Farm Credit bank or association board of directors. A nominating committee's responsibilities are limited to the following:

        (1) Nominate individuals who the committee determines meet the eligibility requirements to run for open director positions. The committee must endeavor to ensure representation from all areas of the Farm Credit bank's or association's territory and, as nearly as possible, all types of agriculture practiced within the territory.

        (2) Evaluate the qualifications of the director candidates. The evaluation process must consider whether there are any known obstacles preventing a candidate from performing the duties of the position.

        (3) Nominate at least two candidates for each director position being voted on by stockholders. If two nominees cannot be identified, the nominating committee must provide written explanation to the existing board of the efforts to locate candidates or the reasons for disqualifying any other candidate that resulted in fewer than two nominees.

        (4) Maintain records of its meetings, including a record of attendance at meetings.

        (5) Identify, evaluate, and nominate eligible individuals for service on the next nominating committee, if permitted by the institution.

        (e)  Each Farm Credit bank and association must provide its nominating committee reasonable access to administrative resources in order for the committee to perform its duties. Each Farm Credit bank and association must, at a minimum, provide its nominating committee with FCA regulations and guidance on nominating committees, a current list of stockholders, the most recent bylaws, the current director qualifications policy, and a copy of the policies and procedures that the bank or the association has adopted pursuant to § 611.320(a) ensuring impartial elections. On the request of the nominating committee, the institution must also provide a summary of the current board self-evaluation. The bank or association may require a pledge of confidentiality by committee members prior to releasing evaluation documents.

        § 611.326   Floor nominations for open Farm Credit bank and association director positions.

#### § § 611.326

        (a) Each floor nominee must be eligible for the director position for which the person has been nominated.

        (b)(1) Voting stockholders of associations must be allowed to make floor nominations for every open stockholder-elected director position. Associations using only mail ballots must allow nominations from the floor at every session of an annual meeting. Associations permitting stockholders to cast votes during annual meetings may only allow nominations from the floor at the first session of the annual meeting.

        (2) If floor nominations are permitted by a Farm Credit bank's election policies and procedures, voting stockholders must be allowed to make floor nominations for every open stockholder-elected director position and a physical meeting space must exist. Before every director election by a Farm Credit bank, the bank must inform voting stockholders whether floor nominations will be accepted.

        (c) Each association's board of directors must adopt policies and procedures for making and accepting floor nominations of candidates to stand for election to its board of directors. Each Farm Credit bank's board of directors allowing nominations from the floor must also adopt policies and procedures for making and accepting floor nominations. Policies and procedures for floor nominations must, at a minimum, provide that:

        (1) Floor nominations may only be made after the nominating committee has provided its list of director-nominees.

        (2) No more than a second by a voting stockholder to a nomination from the floor is required. After receiving a floor nomination, the floor nominee must state if he or she accepts the nomination.

        (3) Floor nominees must make the disclosures required by § 611.330 of this part.

> [75 FR 18741, Apr. 12, 2010]

        § 611.330   Disclosures of Farm Credit bank and association director-nominees.

#### § § 611.330

        (a) Each Farm Credit bank and association's board of directors must adopt policies and procedures that ensure a disclosure statement is prepared by each director-nominee. At a minimum, each disclosure statement for each nominee must:

        (1) State the nominee's name, city and state of residence, business address if any, age, and business experience during the last 5 years, including each nominee's principal occupation and employment during the last 5 years.

        (2) List all business interests on whose board of directors the nominee serves or is otherwise employed in a position of authority and state the principal business in which the business interest is engaged.

        (3) Identify any family relationship of the nominee that would be reportable under part 612 of this chapter if elected to the institution's board.

        (b)(1) Floor nominees who are not incumbent directors must provide to the Farm Credit bank or association the information referred to in this section and in § 620.6(e) and (f) of this chapter. The information must be provided in either paper or electronic form within the time period prescribed by the institution's bylaws or policies and procedures. If the institution does not have a prescribed time period, each floor nominee must provide this information to the institution within 5 business days of the nomination. If stockholders will not vote solely by mail ballot upon conclusion of the meeting, each floor nominee must provide the information at the first session at which voting is held.

        (2) For each nominee who is not an incumbent director or a nominee from the floor, the nominee must provide the information referred to in this section and in § 620.6(e) and (f) of this chapter.

        (c) Each Farm Credit bank and association must distribute director-nominee disclosure information to all stockholders eligible to vote in the election. Institutions may either restate such information in a standard format or provide complete copies of each nominee's disclosure statement.

        (1) Disclosure information for each director-nominee must be provided as part of the Annual Meeting Information Statement (AMIS) issued for director elections in accordance with § 620.21(b) of this chapter.

        (2) Disclosure information for each director-nominee must be distributed or mailed with ballots or proxy ballots. Farm Credit banks and associations must ensure that the disclosure information on floor nominees is provided to voting stockholders by delivering ballots for the election of directors in the same format as the comparable information contained in the AMIS.

        (d) No person may be a nominee for director who does not make the disclosures required by this section.

        § 611.340   Confidentiality and security in voting.

#### § § 611.340

        (a) Each Farm Credit bank and association's board of directors must adopt policies and procedures that:

        (1) Ensure the security of all records and materials related to a stockholder vote including, but not limited to, ballots, proxy ballots, and other related materials.

        (2) Ensure that ballots and proxy ballots are provided only to stockholders who are eligible to vote as of the record date set for the stockholder vote.

        (3) Provide for the establishment of a tellers committee or an independent third party who will be responsible for validating ballots and proxies and tabulating voting results. A tellers committee may only consist of voting stockholders who are not employees, directors, director-nominees, or members of that election cycle's nominating committee.

        (4) Ensure that a list of eligible voting stockholders (or identity codes of eligible voting stockholders) as of the voting record date is provided to the tellers committee or independent third party that will be tabulating the vote to ensure the validity of the votes cast. A small number of specifically authorized administrative employees of the institution may assist the tellers committee in such verifications, provided the institution implements procedures to ensure the confidentiality and security of the information made available to the employees. If an institution is using a tellers committee, verification of voter eligibility must be done separate and apart from the opening and tabulating of the actual ballots and may be done in advance of the vote tabulation, any time after the list of eligible voting stockholders has been provided to the tellers committee.

        (5) Ensure that all information and materials regarding how or whether an individual stockholder has voted remain confidential, including protecting the information from disclosure to the institution's directors, stockholders, or employees, or any other person except:

        (i) A duly appointed tellers committee;

        (ii) A small number of specifically authorized administrative employees assisting the tellers committee by validating stockholders' eligibility to vote;

        (iii) An independent third party tabulating the vote; or

        (iv) The Farm Credit Administration.

        (b) No Farm Credit bank or association may use signed ballots in stockholder votes. A bank or association may use balloting procedures, such as an identity code, that can be used to identify whether an individual stockholder is eligible to vote or has previously submitted a vote. In weighted voting, the votes must be tabulated by an independent third party.

        (c) An independent third party or each member of the tellers committee that tabulates the votes, and any administrative employees assisting the tellers committee in verifying stockholder eligibility to vote, must sign a certificate declaring that such party, member, or employee will not disclose to any person (including the institution, its directors, stockholders, or employees) any information about how or whether an individual stockholder has voted, except that the information must be disclosed to the Farm Credit Administration, if requested.

        (d) Once a Farm Credit bank or association receives a ballot, the vote of that stockholder is final, except that a stockholder may withdraw a proxy ballot before balloting begins at a stockholders' meeting. A Farm Credit bank or association may give a stockholder voting by proxy an opportunity to give voting discretion to the proxy of the stockholder's choice, provided that the proxy is also a stockholder eligible to vote.

        (e) Ballots and proxy ballots must be safeguarded before the time of distribution or mailing to voting stockholders and after the time of receipt by the bank or association until disposal. When stockholder meetings are held for the purpose of conducting elections or other votes, only proxy ballots may be accepted prior to any or all sessions of the stockholders' meeting and mail ballots may only be distributed after the conclusion of the meeting. In an election of directors, ballots, proxy ballots, and election records must be retained at least until the end of the term of office of the director. In other stockholder votes, ballots, proxy ballots, and records must be retained for at least 3 years after the vote.

        (f) An institution and its officers, directors, and employees may not make any public announcement of the results of a stockholder vote before the tellers committee or independent third party has validated the results of the vote.

        § 611.350   Application of cooperative principles to the election of directors.

#### § § 611.350

        In the election of directors, each Farm Credit institution shall comply with the following cooperative principles as well as those set forth in § 615.5230 of this chapter, unless otherwise required by statute or regulation.

        (a) Each voting stockholder of an association or bank for cooperatives has only one vote, regardless of the number of shares owned or the number of loans outstanding. Each voting stockholder-association of a Farm Credit Bank has only one vote that is assigned a weight proportional to the number of that association's voting stockholders. Each voting stockholder of an agricultural credit bank has only one vote, unless another voting scheme has been approved by the Farm Credit Administration.

        (b) If an association apportions its territory into geographic regions for director nomination or election purposes, out-of-territory voting stockholders must be assigned to a geographic region.

        (c) All voting stockholders of a Farm Credit institution have the right to vote in any stockholder vote to remove any director.

      Subpart D—Compensation Practices of Farm Credit Banks and Associations

        § 611.400   Compensation of bank board members.

#### § § 611.400

        (a) Farm Credit banks are authorized to pay fair and reasonable compensation to directors for services performed in an official capacity at a rate not to exceed the level established in section 4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, unless the FCA determines that such a level adversely affects the safety and soundness of the institution.

        (b) The bank director compensation level established in section 4.21 of the Act shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the following manner: Current year's maximum compensation = Prior year's maximum compensation adjusted by the prior year's annual average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. Adjustments will be made to the bank director statutory compensation limit beginning from October 28, 1992 (the date of enactment of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992). Additionally, each year the FCA will communicate the CPI adjusted bank director statutory compensation limit.

        (c)(1) A Farm Credit bank is authorized to pay a director up to 30 percent more than the statutory compensation limit in exceptional circumstances where the director contributes extraordinary time and effort in the service of the bank and its shareholders.

        (2) Banks must document the exceptional circumstances justifying additional director compensation. The documentation must describe:

        (i) The exceptional circumstances justifying the additional director compensation, including the extraordinary time and effort the director devoted to bank business; and

        (ii) The amount and the terms and conditions of the additional director compensation.

        (d) Each bank board shall adopt a written policy regarding compensation of bank directors. The policy shall address, at a minimum, the following areas:

        (1) The activities or functions for which attendance is necessary and appropriate and may be compensated, except that a Farm Credit bank shall not compensate any director for rendering services on behalf of any other Farm Credit System institution or a cooperative of which the director is a member, or for performing other assignments of a non-official nature;

        (2) The methodology for determining each director's rate of compensation; and

        (3) The exceptional circumstances under which the board would pay additional compensation for any of its directors as authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.

        (e) Directors may also be reimbursed for reasonable travel, subsistence, and other related expenses in accordance with the bank's policy.

        (d) Upon receipt of an association's request to transfer territory, the FCA will review the request and either deny or grant preliminary approval to the request. The FCA may require submission of any supplemental information and analysis it deems appropriate for its consideration of the request to transfer territory.

        (1) When a request is denied, written notice stating the reasons for the denial will be transmitted to the associations, and a copy provided to the funding bank.

        (2) When a request is preliminarily approved, written notice of the preliminary approval will be transmitted to the associations, and a copy provided to the funding bank. Preliminary approval by the FCA does not constitute approval of the territory transfer. Final approval is granted only in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. In connection with granting preliminary approval, the FCA may impose conditions in writing.

        (e) Upon receipt of preliminary approval by the FCA, each constituent association must, by written notice, and in accordance with its bylaws, call a meeting of its voting stockholders. The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting stockholders of each association present and voting or voting by written proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present is required for stockholder approval of a territory transfer.

        (f) Notice of the meeting to consider and act upon a proposed territory transfer must be accompanied by the following information covering each constituent association:

        (1) A statement either on the first page of the materials or on the notice of the stockholders' meeting, in capital letters and bold face type, that:

        (2) A copy of the Agreement to Transfer Territory and a summary of the major provisions of the Agreement;

        (3) The reason the territory transfer is proposed;

        (4) A map of the association's territory as it would look after the transfer;

        (5) A summary of the differences, if any, between the transferor and transferee associations' interest rates, interest rate policies, collection policies, service fees, bylaws, and any other items of interest that would impact a borrower's lending relationship with the institution;

        (6) A statement that all loans of the transferor association that finance operations located in the transferred territory will be transferred to the transferee association except as otherwise provided for in this section or in accordance with agreements between the associations as provided for in § 614.4070;

        (7) Where proxies are to be solicited, a form of written proxy, together with instructions on the purpose and authority for its use, and the proper method for signature by the stockholders; and

        (8) A statement that the associations' bylaws, financial statements for the previous 3 years, and any financial information prepared by the associations concerning the proposed transfer of territory are available on request to the stockholders of any association involved in the transaction.

        (g) No Farm Credit institution, or director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs thereof, may make any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact, or fail to disclose any material fact necessary under the circumstances to make statements made not misleading, to a stockholder of any Farm Credit institution in connection with a territory transfer.

        (h) Upon approval of a proposed territory transfer by the stockholders of the constituent associations, a certified copy of the stockholders' resolution for each constituent association and one executed Agreement to Transfer Territory must be forwarded to the FCA. The territory transfer will be effective when thereafter finally approved and on the date as specified by the FCA. Notice of final approval will be transmitted to the associations and a copy provided to the bank.

        (i) No director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of a Farm Credit institution may make an oral or written representation to any person that a preliminary or final approval by the FCA of a territory transfer constitutes, directly or indirectly, a recommendation on the merits of the transaction or an assurance concerning the adequacy or accuracy of any information provided to any association's stockholders in connection therewith.

        (j) When a Farm Credit institution, or any of its employees, officers, directors, agents, or other persons participating in the conduct of the affairs thereof, make disclosures or representations that, in the judgment of the FCA, are incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading in connection with a territory transfer, whether or not such disclosure or representation is made in disclosure statements required by this subpart, such institution must make such additional or corrective disclosure as directed by the FCA and as is necessary to provide stockholders and the general public with full and fair disclosure.

        (k) The notice and accompanying information required under paragraph (f) of this section may not be sent to stockholders until preliminary approval of the territory transfer has been granted by the FCA.

        (l) Where a territory transfer is proposed simultaneously with a merger or consolidation, both transactions may be voted on by stockholders at the same meeting. Only stockholders of a transferee or transferor association may vote on a territory transfer.

        (m) Each borrower whose real estate or operations is located in a territory that will be transferred must be provided with a written Notice of Territory Transfer immediately after the FCA has granted final approval of the territory transfer. The Notice must inform the borrower of the transfer of the borrower's loan to the transferee association and the exchange of related equities for equities of like kinds and amounts in the transferee association. If a like kind of equity is not available in the transferee association, similar equities must be offered that will not adversely affect the interest of the owner. The Notice must give the borrower 60 days from the effective date of the territory transfer to notify the transferor association in writing if the borrower decides to stay with the transferor association for normal servicing until the current loan is paid. Any application by the borrower for renewal or for additional credit must be made to the transferee association, except as otherwise provided for by an agreement between associations in accordance with § 614.4070.

        (n) This section does not apply to territory transfers initiated by order of the FCA or to territory transfers due to the liquidation of the transferor association.

        (o) Where a proposed action involves the transfer of a portion of an association's territory to an association operating in a different district, such proposal must comply with the provisions of this section and section 5.17(a) of the Act.

        § 611.1126   Reconsiderations of mergers and consolidations.

#### § § 611.1126

        (a) Voting stockholders have the right to reconsider their approval of a merger or consolidation, provided that a petition is filed with the FCA. The petition must be signed by 15 percent of the stockholders (who were eligible to vote on the merger or consolidation proposal) of one or more of the constituent associations. The reconsideration petition must be filed with the FCA within 35 days after the date when the association mailed the notification of the final results of the stockholder vote pursuant to § 611.1122(h).

        (b) Voting stockholders that intend to file a reconsideration petition have a right to obtain from the association of which they are a voting stockholder the voting record date list used by that association for the merger or consolidation vote. The association must provide the voting record date list as soon as possible, but not later than 7 days after receipt of the request. The list must be provided pursuant to the provisions of § 618.8310(b) of this chapter.

        (c) A reconsideration petition must be addressed to the Secretary of the FCA Board and filed with the FCA on or before the deadline described in paragraph (a) of this section. Reconsideration petitions must identify a contact person and provide contact information for that person.

        (2) The FCA will use the postmark, ship date, electronic stamp, or similar evidence as the date of filing the reconsideration petition.

        (d) The FCA will notify the named contact on the reconsideration petition whether the petition was filed on time. On the timely receipt of a reconsideration petition, the FCA will review the petition to determine whether it complies with the requirements of section 7.9 of the Act. Following a determination that the petition was timely filed and complies with applicable requirements, the FCA will give notice to the associations involved in the merger or consolidation for which the reconsideration petition was filed. The associations are not entitled to either a copy of the petition or the names of the petitioners.

        (e) Following FCA notification that a reconsideration petition has been properly filed, a special stockholders meeting must be called by the association(s) to reconsider the merger or consolidation vote. The reconsideration vote must be conducted according to the merger and consolidation voting requirements of § 611.1122(d). If a majority of the stockholders voting, in person or by proxy, at a duly authorized stockholders' meeting from any one of the constituent associations vote against the merger or consolidation under the reconsideration vote, the merger or consolidation will not take place. In the event that the merger or consolidation is approved on reconsideration, the constituent associations must use the second effective date developed under § 611.1122(g)(1).

      Subpart H—Rules for Inter-System Fund Transfers

        § 611.1130   Inter-System transfer of funds and equities.

#### § § 611.1130

        (a) Section 5.17(a)(6) of the Act authorizes the FCA to regulate the borrowing, repayment, and transfer of funds and equities between institutions of the System, including banks, associations, and service corporations chartered under the Act. This section sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which the FCA may direct such a transfer of funds and equities based on its determination with respect to the financial condition of one or more institutions of the System. For purposes of this section, the term “bond” refers to long-term notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations, or short-term discount notes issued by one or more banks pursuant to section 4.2 of the Act.

        (b) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities by one or more banks of the System to another bank of the System where it determines that:

        (1) The receiving institution will not be able to make payments of principal or interest on bonds for which it is primarily liable within the meaning of section 4.4(a) of the Act; or

        (2) The common or preferred stock, participation certificates, or allocated equities of the receiving institution have a book value less than their par or stated values; or

        (3) The total bonds outstanding for which the receiving institution is primarily liable exceed 20 times the combined capital and surplus accounts of the bank; or

        (4) Based on application to it of one or more of the following ratios, the receiving institution is not financially viable in that it will not be able to continue to extend new or additional credit or financial assistance to its eligible borrowers:

        (i) The ratio of stock to earned net worth (including legal reserve, unallocated and reserved surplus, undistributed earnings, and allowance for credit losses) exceeds 2 to 1;

        (ii) The ratio of the outstanding bonds to capital and surplus exceeds 15 to 1;

        (iii) Nonearning assets (any noninterest-bearing assets, including but not limited to cash, noninterest-earning loans, net fixed assets, other property owned, accrued interest receivable, and accounts receivable) exceed 15 percent of total assets;

        (iv) Lendable net worth (interest-earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) is zero or less.

        (c) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities between two or more Federal land bank associations or two or more production credit associations in district where it determines that such transfer:

        (1) Is necessary to provide financial support to the district bank in which those associations are stockholders based on application of the criteria to the bank as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; or

        (2) Is necessary to provide financial support to one or more other like associations in the district based on application of the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this section to the associations, provided that in applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section the ratio of outstanding indebtedness to capital and surplus of the receiving association(s) shall not exceed 9 to 1; or

        (3) Is an integral part of a plan that has been adopted by other institutions of the System, and approved by the FCA, under which those institutions will extend financial assistance to the district bank in which those associations are stockholders.

        (d) A direction by the FCA for a transfer of funds or equities pursuant to this section shall be signed by the Chairman and shall establish the amount, timing, duration, repayment, and other terms of assessments necessary to accomplish such transfer, taking into consideration the financial condition of each institution to be assessed. Where the FCA directs a transfer of funds or equities between associations under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, it may authorize the district bank in which such associations are stockholders to accomplish the necessary assessments through debits and credits to the accounts of the bank.

#### § § 611.1150

        (a)  This subpart sets forth the parameters for one or more Farm Credit System (System) institutions to organize or invest in an Unincorporated Business Entity (UBE) in accordance with the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act).

        (b)  Except as authorized under these regulations, no System institution may manage, control, become a member or partner, or invest in a State-organized or chartered business entity. This subpart applies to each System institution that organizes or invests in a UBE, including a UBE organized for the express purpose of investing in a Rural Business Investment Company. This subpart does not apply to UBEs that one or more System institutions have the authority to establish as Rural Business Investment Companies pursuant to the provisions of title VI of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, as amended (FSRIA) and United States Department of Agriculture regulations implementing FSRIA.

        § 611.1151   Definitions.

#### § § 611.1151

        For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

        means registration certificates, charters, articles of organization, partnership agreements, membership or trust agreements, operating, administration or management agreements, fee agreements or any other documentation on the establishment, ownership, or operation of a UBE.

        means that one System institution, directly _or_ indirectly, owns more than 50 percent of the UBE's equity  serves as the general partner of an LLLP, or constitutes the sole manager or the managing member of a UBE. However, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, if a System institution is the UBE's primary beneficiary, exercises significant influence over the UBE or establishes control under other facts and circumstances in accordance with GAAP. Under this definition, a System institution also will be deemed to have control over the UBE if it exercises decision-making authority in a principal capacity of the UBE as defined under GAAP.

        means a System institution's contribution of money or assets to the operating capital of a UBE that provides ownership rights in return.

        means each System bank under titles I or III of the Act, each System association under title II of the Act, and each service corporation chartered under section 4.25 of the Act.

        means a UBE that is owned or controlled by one or more non-System persons or entities as the term “control” is defined under GAAP.

        means a Limited Partnership (LP), Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), Limited Liability Limited Partnership (LLLP), Limited Liability Company (LLC), Business or other Trust Entity (TE), or other business entity established and maintained under State law that is not incorporated under any law or chartered under Federal law.

        means the services and functions delivered by a UBE for one or more System institutions.

        means acquired property that may expose the owner to risks beyond those commonly associated with loans, including, but not limited to, acquired industrial or manufacturing properties where there is increased risk of incurring potential environmental or other liabilities that may accrue to the owners of such properties.

        § 611.1152   Authority over equity investments in UBEs for business activity.

#### § § 611.1152

        (a)  FCA has regulatory, supervisory, oversight, examination and enforcement authority over each System institution's equity investment in or control of a UBE and the services and functions that a UBE performs for the System institution. This includes FCA's authority to require a System institution's dissolution of, disassociation from, or divestiture of an equity investment in a UBE, or to otherwise condition the approval of equity investments in UBEs.

        (b)  In accordance with section 5.15 of the Act, the cost of regulating and examining System institutions' activities involving UBEs will be taken into account when assessing a System institution for the cost of administering the Act.

        § 611.1153   General restrictions and prohibitions on the use of UBEs.

#### § § 611.1153

        (a)  All UBE business activity must be:

        (1) Necessary or expedient to the business of one or more System institutions owning the UBE; and

        (2) In no instance greater than the functions and services that one or more System institutions owning the UBE are authorized to perform under the Act and as determined by the FCA.

        (b)  System institutions are prohibited from using UBEs to engage in direct lending activities or any other activity that would circumvent the application of cooperative principles, including borrower rights as described in section 4.14A of the Act, or stock ownership, voting rights or patronage as described in section 4.3A of the Act.

        (c)  Each System institution must ensure that:

        (1) The UBE is held out to the public as a separate or subsidiary entity;

        (2) The business transactions, accounts, and records of the UBE are not commingled with those of the System institution; and

        (3) All transactions between the UBE and System institution directors, officers, employees, and agents are conducted at arm's length, in the interest of the System institution, and in compliance with the standards of conduct rules in 12 CFR 612, subpart A of this chapter.

        (d)  A UBE owned solely by a single System institution (including between and among a parent agricultural credit association and its production credit association and Federal land credit association subsidiaries and between a parent agricultural credit bank and its subsidiary Farm Credit Bank) as a one-member UBE is limited to the following special purposes:

        (1) Acquiring and managing the unusual or complex collateral associated with loans; and

        (2) Providing limited services such as electronic transaction, fixed asset, trustee or other services that are integral to the daily internal operations of a System institution.

        (e)  A System institution operating through a parent-subsidiary structure may not create a UBE partnership between or among the parent agricultural credit association and its production credit association and Federal land credit association subsidiaries or between a parent Agricultural Credit Bank and its Farm Credit Bank subsidiary.

        (f)  Except as provided in this paragraph, a System institution may not create a subsidiary of a UBE that it has organized or invested in under this subpart or enable the UBE itself to create a subsidiary or any other type of affiliated entity. A System institution may establish a UBE as a subsidiary of a UBE formed pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section to hold each investor's pro-rata interest in acquired property provided that the loan collateral at issue involves a multi-lender transaction that includes System and non-System lenders.

        (g)  (1) Each System institution's equity investment in a UBE must be established in a manner that will limit potential exposure of the System institution to no more than the amount of its investment in the UBE.

        (2) A System institution cannot become a general partner of any partnership other than an LLLP.

        (h)  The aggregate amount of equity investments that a single System institution is authorized to hold in UBEs must not exceed one percent of the institution's total outstanding loans, calculated at the time of each investment. On a case-by-case basis, FCA may approve an exception to this limitation that would exceed the one-percent aggregate limit. Conversely, FCA may impose a percentage limit lower than the one-percent aggregate limit based on safety or soundness and other relevant concerns. This one-percent aggregate limit does not apply to equity investments in one-member UBEs formed for acquired property as permitted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Any equity investment made in a UBE by a service corporation must be attributed to its System institution owners based on the ownership percentage of each bank or association.

        (i)  A System institution is prohibited from:

        (1) Making any equity investment in a third-party UBE except as may be authorized on a case-by-case basis under § 615.5140(e) of this chapter for de minimis and passive investments. Such requests would be considered outside of this rule.

        (2) Serving as the general partner or manager of a third-party UBE; or

        (3) Being designated as the primary beneficiary of a third-party UBE, either alone or with other System institutions.

        (j)  Non-System persons or entities may not invest in a UBE that is controlled by a System institution except that non-System persons or entities may own 20 percent or less of the equity of a System-controlled UBE organized to deliver services integral to the daily internal operations of a System institution.

        (k)  The provisions of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section do not apply to UBEs formed for the purpose of acquiring and managing unusual or complex collateral associated with multiple-lender loan transactions in which non-System persons or entities are participants.

        § 611.1210   Advance notices—commencement resolution and notice to equity holders.

#### § § 611.1210

        (a)  Your board of directors must begin the termination process by adopting a commencement resolution stating your intention to terminate Farm Credit status under section 7.10 of the Act. Immediately after you adopt the commencement resolution, send a certified copy by overnight mail to us and to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC). If your institution is an association, also send a copy to your affiliated bank. If your institution is a bank, also send a copy to your affiliated associations, the other Farm Credit banks, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation).

        (b)  Within 5 business days after adopting the commencement resolution, you must:

        (1) Send us copies of all contracts and agreements related to the termination.

        (2) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section:

        (i) Send an advance notice to all equity holders stating you are taking steps to terminate System status. Immediately upon mailing the notice to equity holders, you must also place it in a prominent location on your Web site. The advance notice must describe the following:

        (A) The process of termination;

        (B) The expected effect of termination on borrowers and other equity holders, including the effect on borrower rights and the consequences of any stock retirements before termination;

        (C) The type of charter the successor institution will have; and

        (D) Any bylaw creating a special class of borrower stock and participation certificates under paragraph (f) of this section.

        (ii) Send us a draft of the advance notice by facsimile or electronic mail before mailing it to your equity holders. If we have not contacted you within 2 business days of our receipt of the draft notice regarding modifications, you may mail the notice to your equity holders.

        (c)  If your institution is a terminating bank, within 10 days of adopting the commencement resolution, your bank and the other Farm Credit banks must begin negotiations to provide for your satisfaction of liabilities (other than your primary liability) under section 4.4 of the Act. The Funding Corporation may, at its option, be a party to the negotiations to the extent necessary to fulfill its duties with respect to financing and disclosure. The agreement must comply with the requirements in § 611.1270(c).

        (d)  Between the date your board of directors adopts the commencement resolution and the termination date, you must give the following information to your loan applicants and equity holders:

        (1) For each loan applicant who is not a current stockholder, describe at the time of loan application:

        (i) The effect of the proposed termination on the prospective loan; and

        (ii) Whether, after the proposed termination, the borrower will continue to have any of the borrower rights provided under the Act and regulations.

        (2) For any equity holders who ask to have their equities retired, explain that the retirement would extinguish the holder's right to exchange those equities for an interest in the successor institution. In addition, inform holders of equities entitled to your residual assets in liquidation that retirement before termination would extinguish their right to dissent from the termination and have their equities retired.

        (e)  Through the termination date, a terminating bank may continue to participate in the issuance of consolidated and System-wide obligations to the same extent it would be able to participate if it were not terminating.

        (f)  Notwithstanding any requirements to the contrary in § 615.5230(c) of this chapter, you may adopt bylaws providing for the issuance of a special class of stock and participation certificates between the date of adoption of a commencement resolution and the termination date. Your voting stockholders must approve the special class before you adopt the commencement resolution. The equities must comply with section 4.3A of the Act and be identical in all respects to existing classes of equities that are entitled to the residual assets of the institution in a liquidation, except for the value a holder will receive in a termination. In a termination, the holder of the special class of stock receives value equal to the lower of either par (or face) value, or the value calculated under § 611.1280(c) and (d). A holder must have the same right to vote (if the equity is held on the voting record date) and to dissent as holders of similar equities issued before the commencement resolution. If the termination does not occur, the special classes of stock and participation certificates must automatically convert into shares of the otherwise identical equities.

        (4) Fifteen (15) days after any reconsideration vote.

        § 611.1250   Preliminary exit fee estimate.

#### § § 611.1250

        (a)  You must provide a preliminary exit fee estimate to us when you submit the plan of termination under § 611.1221. Calculate the preliminary exit fee estimate in the following order:

        (1) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of assets and liabilities for the 12-month period as of the quarter end immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination.

        (2) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not average daily balances will be referred to as “dollar amount.”

        (3) Compute the average daily balances based on financial statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the quarter end immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination, must be independently audited by a qualified public accountant. We may, in our discretion, waive the audit requirement if an independent audit was performed as of a date less than 6 months before you submit the plan of termination.

        (4) Make adjustments to assets as follows:

        (i) Add back expenses you have incurred related to termination. Related expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, equity holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the System or parties other than the terminating institution and its stockholders.

        (ii) Subtract the dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax expenses, if any, due to the termination.

        (iii) Add the dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax benefits, if any, due to the termination.

        (iv) Adjust for the dollar amount of significant transactions you reasonably expect to occur between the quarter end before you file your plan of termination and date of termination. Examples of these transactions include, but are not limited to, gains or losses on the sale of assets, retirements of equity, loan repayments, and patronage distributions. Do not make adjustments for future expenses related to termination, such as severance or special retirement payments, or stock retirements to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit institutions.

        (5) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.

        (6) Make any adjustments we require under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (7) After making these adjustments to assets and liabilities, subtract liabilities from assets. This is your preliminary total capital for purposes of termination.

        (8) Multiply assets as adjusted above by 6 percent, and subtract this amount from preliminary total capital. This is your preliminary exit fee estimate.

        (b)  (1) Affiliated associations that are terminating with you must calculate their individual preliminary exit fee estimates as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of assets and liabilities for the 12-month period as of the quarter end immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination.

        (3) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not average daily balances will be referred to as “dollar amount.”

        (4) Compute the average daily balances based on bank-only financial statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the quarter end immediately before the date you send us your plan of termination, must be independently audited by a qualified public accountant. We may, in our discretion, waive this requirement if an independent audit was performed as of a date less than 6 months before you submit the plan of termination.

        (5) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:

        (i) Add back to assets the following:

        (A) Expenses you have incurred related to termination. Related expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, equity holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the System or parties other than the terminating institution and its stockholders.

        (B) Any specific allowance for losses, and a pro rata portion of any general allowance for credit losses, on direct loans to associations that you do not expect to incur before or at termination.

        (ii) Subtract from your assets and liabilities an amount equal to your direct loans to your affiliated associations that are not terminating.

        (iii) Subtract the following from assets:

        (A) Equity investments in your institution that are held by nonterminating associations and that you expect to transfer to another System bank before or at termination. A nonterminating association's investment consists of purchased equities, allocated equities, and a share of the bank's unallocated surplus calculated in accordance with the bank's bylaw provisions on liquidation. We may require a different calculation method for the unallocated surplus if we determine that using the liquidation provision would be inequitable to stockholders; and

        (B) The dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax expenses, if any, due to the termination.

        (iv) Add the dollar amount of current and deferred estimated tax benefits, if any, due to the termination.

        (v) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.

        (vi) Adjust for the dollar amount of significant transactions you reasonably expect to occur between the quarter end before you file your plan of termination and date of termination. Examples of these transactions include, but are not limited to, retirements of equity, loan repayments, and patronage distributions. Do not make adjustments for future expenses related to termination, such as severance or special retirement payments, or stock retirements to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit institutions.

        (6) Make any adjustments we require under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (7) After the above adjustments, combine your balance sheet with the balance sheets of your terminating associations after they have made the adjustments required in paragraph (a) of this section. Subtract liabilities from assets. This is your preliminary total capital estimate for purposes of termination.

        (8) Multiply the assets of the combined balance sheet after the above adjustments by 6 percent. Subtract this amount from the preliminary total capital estimate of the combined balance sheet. The remainder is the preliminary exit fee estimate of the bank and terminating affiliated associations.

        (9) Your preliminary exit fee estimate is the amount by which the preliminary exit fee estimate for the combined entity exceeds the total of the individual preliminary exit fee estimates of your affiliated terminating associations.

        (c)  (1) We will review your account balances, transactions over the 3 years before the date of the termination resolution under § 611.1220, and any subsequent transactions. Our review will include, but not be limited to, the following:

        (i) Additions to or subtractions from any allowance for losses;

        (ii) Additions to assets or liabilities, or subtractions from assets or liabilities, due to transactions that are outside your ordinary course of business;

        (iii) Dividends or patronage refunds exceeding your usual practices;

        (iv) Changes in the institution's capital plan, or in implementing the plan, that increased or decreased the level of borrower investment;

        (v) Contingent liabilities, such as loss-sharing obligations, that can be reasonably quantified; and

        (vi) Assets, including real property and servicing rights, that may be overvalued, undervalued, or not recorded on your books.

        (2) If we determine the account balances do not accurately show the value of your assets and liabilities (whether the assets and liabilities were booked before or during the 3-year look-back adjustment period), we will make any adjustments we deem necessary.

        (3) We may require you to reverse the effect of a transaction if we determine that:

        (i) You have retired capital outside the ordinary course of business;

        (ii) You have taken any other actions unrelated to your core business that have the effect of changing the exit fee; or

        (iii) You incurred expenses related to termination prior to the 12-month average daily balance period on which the exit fee calculation is based.

        (4) We may require you to make these adjustments to the preliminary exit fee estimate that is disclosed in the information statement, the final exit fee calculation, and the calculations of the value of equities held by dissenting stockholders, Farm Credit institutions that choose to have their equities retired at termination, and reaffiliating associations.

        § 611.1255   Exit fee calculation.

#### § § 611.1255

        (a)  Calculate the final exit fee in the following order:

        (1) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of assets and liabilities for the 12-month period preceding the termination date. Assume for this calculation that you have not paid or accrued the items described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

        (2) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not average daily balances will be referred to as “dollar amount.”

        (3) Compute the average daily balances based on financial statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the termination date, must be independently audited by a qualified public accountant.

        (4) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:

        (i) Add back expenses related to the termination. Related expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, payments of severance and special retirements, equity holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the System or parties other than the terminating institution and its stockholders.

        (ii) Subtract from assets the dollar amount of current and deferred tax expenses, if any, due to the termination.

        (iii) Add to assets the dollar amount of current and deferred tax benefits, if any, due to the termination.

        (iv) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as regulatory capital under the capital or collateral requirements in subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.

        (v) Make the adjustments that we require under § 611.1250(c). For the final exit fee, we will review and may require additional adjustments for transactions between the date you adopted the termination resolution and the termination date.

        (5) After making these adjustments to assets and liabilities, subtract liabilities from assets. This is your total capital for purposes of termination.

        (6) Multiply assets by 6 percent, and subtract this amount from total capital. This is your final exit fee.

        (b)  (1) The individual exit fees of affiliated associations that are terminating with you must be calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) Base your exit fee calculation on the average daily balances of assets and liabilities for the 12-month period preceding the termination date. Assume for this calculation that you have not paid or accrued the items described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) and (b)(5)(iv) of this section.

        (3) Any amounts we refer to in this section are average daily balances unless we specify that they are not. Amounts that are not average daily balances will be referred to as “dollar amount.”

        (4) Compute the average daily balances based on bank-only financial statements that comply with GAAP. The financial statements, as of the termination date, must be independently audited by a qualified public accountant.

        (5) Make adjustments to assets and liabilities as follows:

        (i) Add back the following to your assets:

        (A) Expenses you have incurred related to termination. Related expenses include, but are not limited to, legal services, accounting services, tax services, studies, auditing, business planning, payments of severance and special retirements, equity holder meetings, and application fees for the termination and reorganization. Do not add back to assets expenses related to a requirement by the FCA to engage independent experts to conduct assessments, analyses, or studies, or to request rulings that solely address the impact of the termination on the System or parties other than the terminating institution and its stockholders.

        (B) Any specific allowance for losses, and a pro rata share of any general allowance for credit losses, on direct loans to associations that are paid off or transferred before or at termination.

        (ii) Subtract from your assets and liabilities your direct loans to affiliated associations that were paid off or transferred in the 12-month period before termination or at termination.

        (iii) Subtract from your assets the following:

        (A) Equity investments held in your institution by affiliated associations that you transferred at termination or during the 12 months before termination; and

        (B) The dollar amount of current and deferred tax expenses, if any, due to the termination;

        (iv) Add to assets, the dollar amount of estimated current and deferred tax benefits, if any, due to the termination.

        (v) Subtract from liabilities any liability that we treat as regulatory capital (or that we do not treat as a liability) under the capital or collateral requirements in subparts H and K of part 615 of this chapter.

        (vi) Make the adjustments that we require under § 611.1250(c). For the final exit fee, we will review and may require additional adjustments for transactions between the date you adopted the termination resolution and the termination date.

        (6) After the above adjustments, combine your balance sheet with the balance sheets of terminating associations after making the adjustments required in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (7) Subtract combined liabilities from combined assets. This is the total capital of the combined balance sheet.

        (8) Multiply the assets of the combined balance sheet after the above adjustments by 6 percent. Subtract this amount from the total capital of the combined balance sheet. This amount is the combined final exit fee for your institution and the terminating affiliated associations.

        (9) Your final exit fee is the amount by which the combined final exit fee exceeds the total of the individual final exit fees of your affiliated terminating associations.

        (c)  On the termination date, you must:

        (1) Deposit into an escrow account acceptable to us and the FCSIC an amount equal to 110 percent of the preliminary exit fee estimate, adjusted to account for stock retirements to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit institutions, and any other adjustments we require.

        (2) Deposit into an escrow account acceptable to us an amount equal to 110 percent of the equity you must retire for dissenting stockholders and System institutions holding stock that would be entitled to a share of the remaining assets in a liquidation.

        (d)  Following the independent audit of the institution's account balances as of the termination date, we will determine the amount of the final exit fee and the amounts owed to stockholders to retire their equities. We will then direct the escrow agent to:

        (1) Pay the exit fee to the Farm Credit Insurance Fund;

        (2) Pay the amounts owed to dissenting stockholders and Farm Credit institutions; and

        (3) Return any remaining amounts to the successor institution.

        (e)  If the amount held in escrow is not enough to pay the amounts under paragraph (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, the successor institution must pay any remaining liability to the escrow agent for distribution to the appropriate parties. The termination application must include evidence that, after termination, the successor institution will pay any remaining amounts owed.

        § 611.1260   Payment of debts and assessments—terminating association.

#### § § 611.1260

        (a)  If your institution is a terminating association, you must pay or make adequate provision for the payment of all outstanding debt obligations and assessments.

        (b)  If the successor institution will not become an OFI, you must either:

        (1) Pay debts and assessments owed to your affiliated Farm Credit bank at termination; or

        (2) With your affiliated Farm Credit bank's concurrence, arrange to pay any obligations or assessments to the bank after termination.

        (c)  You must pay or make adequate provision for payment of obligations to any Farm Credit institution (other than your affiliated bank) under any loss-sharing or other agreement.

        § 611.1265   Retirement of a terminating association's investment in its affiliated bank.

#### § § 611.1265

        (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this subpart to the contrary, we may prohibit a bank from retiring the equities you hold in the bank if the retirement would cause the bank to fall below its regulatory capital requirements after retirement, or if we determine that the bank would be in an unsafe or unsound condition after retirement.

        (b)  Your affiliated bank may retire the purchased and allocated equities held by your institution in the bank according to the terms of the bank's capital revolvement plan or an agreement between you and the bank.

        (c)  Your affiliated bank must retire any equities not subject to an agreement or revolvement plan no later than when you or the successor institution pays off your loan from the bank.

        (d)  When your bank retires equities you own in the bank, the bank must pay par or face value for purchased and allocated equities, less any impairment. The bank may not pay you any portion of its unallocated surplus.

        (e)  If another Farm Credit institution makes an agreement to retire equities you hold in that institution after termination, we may require that institution to exclude part or all of those equities from assets and capital when the institution calculates its regulatory capital under parts 615 and 628 of this chapter.

        § 611.1270   Repayment of obligations—terminating bank.

#### § § 611.1270

        (a)  If your institution is a terminating bank, you must pay or make adequate provision for the payment of all outstanding debt obligations, and provide for your responsibility for any probable contingent liabilities identified.

        (b)  After consulting with the other Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the FCSIC, you must pay or make adequate provision for payment of your primary liability on consolidated or System-wide obligations in a method that we deem acceptable. Before we make a final decision on your proposal and as we deem necessary, we may consult with the other Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the FCSIC.

        (c)  (1) You and the other Farm Credit banks must enter into an agreement, which is subject to our approval, covering obligations issued under section 4.2 of the Act and outstanding on the termination date. The agreement must specify how you and your successor institution will make adequate provision for the payment of your joint and several liability to holders of obligations other than those obligations on which you are primarily liable, in the event we make calls for payment under section 4.4 of the Act. You and your successor institution must also provide for your liability under section 4.4(a)(1) of the Act to pay interest on the individual obligations issued by other System banks. As a part of the agreement, you must also agree that your successor institution will provide ongoing information to the Funding Corporation to enable it to fulfill its funding and disclosure duties. The Funding Corporation may, at its option, be a party to the agreement to the extent necessary to fulfill its duties with respect to financing and disclosure.

        (2) If you and the other Farm Credit banks are unable to reach agreement within 90 days before the proposed termination date, we will specify the manner in which you will make adequate provision for the payment of the liabilities in question and how we will make joint and several calls for those obligations outstanding on the termination date.

        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision in these regulations, the successor institution will be jointly and severally liable for consolidated and System-wide debt outstanding on the termination date (other than the obligations on which you are primarily liable). The successor institution will also be liable for interest on other banks' individual obligations as described in section 4.4(a)(1) of the Act and outstanding on the termination date. The termination application must include evidence that the successor institution will continue to be liable for consolidated and System-wide debt and for interest on other banks' individual obligations.

        § 611.1275   Retirement of equities held by other System institutions.

#### § § 611.1275

        (a)  If your institution is a terminating institution, System institutions that own your equities have the right to require you to retire the equities on the termination date.

        (b)  You must retire the equities in accordance with the liquidation provisions in your bylaws unless we determine that the liquidation provisions would result in an inequitable distribution to stockholders. If we make such a determination, we will require you to distribute the equity in accordance with another method that we deem equitable to stockholders. Before you retire any equity, you must make the following adjustments to the amount of stockholder equity as stated in the financial statements on the termination date:

        (1) Make deductions for any taxes due to the termination that have not yet been recorded;

        (2) Deduct the amount of the exit fee; and

        (3) Make any adjustments described under § 611.1250(c) that we may require as we deem appropriate.

        (c)  As an alternative to equity retirement, an affiliated association that reaffiliates with another Farm Credit bank instead of terminating with its bank has the right to require the terminating bank to transfer its investment to its new affiliated bank when it reaffiliates. If your institution is a terminating bank, at the time of reaffiliation you must transfer the purchased and allocated equities held by the association, as well as its share of unallocated surplus, to the new affiliated bank. Calculate the association's share before deduction of the exit fee as of the month end preceding the reaffiliation date (or the termination date if it is the same as the reaffiliation date) in accordance with the liquidation provisions of your bylaws, unless we determine that the liquidation provisions would result in an inequitable distribution. If we make such a determination, we will require you to distribute the association's share of your unallocated surplus in accordance with another method that we deem equitable to stockholders. Before you distribute any unallocated surplus, you must make the following adjustments to stockholder equity as stated in the financial statements as of the month end preceding the reaffiliation date (or the termination date if it is the same as the reaffiliation date):

        (1) Add back any taxes due to the termination, and the exit fee; and

        (2) Make any adjustments described under § 611.1250(c) that we may require as we deem appropriate.

        (d)  No Farm Credit institution may retain an equity interest otherwise prohibited by law in a successor institution

        § 611.1280   Dissenting stockholders' rights.

#### § § 611.1280

        (a)  A dissenting stockholder is an equity holder (other than a System institution) in a terminating institution on the termination date who either:

        (1) Was eligible to vote on the termination resolution and voted against termination;

        (2) Was an equity holder on the voting record date but was not eligible to vote; or

        (3) Became an equity holder after the voting record date.

        (b)  A dissenting stockholder may require a terminating institution to retire the stockholder's equity interest in the terminating institution.

        (c)  You must pay a dissenting stockholder according to the liquidation provision in your bylaws, except that you must pay at least par or face value for eligible borrower stock (as defined in section 4.9A(d)(2) of the Act). If we determine that the liquidation provision is inequitable to stockholders, we will require you to calculate their share in accordance with another formula that we deem equitable.

        (d)  Before you retire any equity, you must make the following adjustments to the amount of stockholder equity as stated in the financial statements on the termination date:

        (1) Deduct any taxes due to the termination that you have not yet recorded;

        (2) Deduct the amount of the exit fee; and

        (3) Make any adjustments described under § 611.1250(c) that we may require as we deem appropriate.

        (e)  You must pay dissenting stockholders for their equities as follows:

        (1) Pay cash for the par or face value of purchased stock, less any impairment;

        (2) For equities other than purchased equities, you may:

        (i) Pay cash;

        (ii) Cause or otherwise provide for the successor institution to issue, on the date of termination, subordinated debt to the stockholder with a face value equal to the value of the remaining equities. This subordinated debt must have a maturity date of 7 years or less, must have priority in liquidation ahead of all equity, and must carry a rate of interest not less than the rate (at the time of termination) for debt of comparable maturity issued by the U.S. Treasury plus 1 percent; or

        (iii) Provide for a combination of cash and subordinated debt as described above.

        (f)  If you have adopted bylaws under § 611.1210(f), you must pay a dissenting stockholder who owns shares of the special class of stock an amount equal to the lower of the par (or face) value or the value of such stock as determined under § 611.1280(c) and (d).

        (g)  The notice to equity holders required in § 611.1240(f) must include a form for stockholders to send back to you, stating their intention to exercise dissenters' rights. The notice must contain the following information:

        (1) A description of the rights of dissenting stockholders set forth in this section and the approximate value per share that a dissenting stockholder can expect to receive. State whether the successor institution will require borrowers to be stockholders or whether it will require stockholders to be borrowers.

        (2) A description of the current book and par value per share of each class of equities, and the expected book and market value of the stockholder's interest in the successor institution.

        (3) A statement that a stockholder must return the enclosed form to you within 30 days if the stockholder chooses to exercise dissenters' rights.

        (h)  Equity holders that acquire their equities after the termination vote must also receive the notice described in paragraph (g) of this section. You must give them at least 5 business days to decide whether to request retirement of their stock.

        (i)  If a reconsideration vote is held and the termination is disapproved, the right of stockholders to exercise dissenters' rights is rescinded. If a reconsideration vote is held and the termination is approved, you must retire the equities of dissenting stockholders as if there had been no reconsideration vote.

        § 611.1285   Loan refinancing by borrowers.

#### § § 611.1285

        (a)  At the request of a borrower seeking refinancing with another System institution before you terminate, you must give credit and loan information about the borrower to such institution.

        (b)  If, at the termination date, we have not assigned your territory to another System institution, any System institution may lend in your territory, to the extent otherwise permitted by the Act and the regulations in this chapter.

        § 611.1290   Continuation of borrower rights.

#### § § 611.1290

        You may not require a waiver of contractual borrower rights provisions as a condition of borrowing from and owning equity in the successor institution. Institutions that become other financing institutions on termination must comply with the applicable borrower rights provisions in the Act and part 617 of this chapter.

        § 612.2137   Elements of a Standards of Conduct Program.

#### § § 612.2137

        Each System institution board of directors is ultimately responsible for the implementation, oversight of, and compliance with, the Standards of Conduct Program. In fulfilling these responsibilities, each System institution board of directors must do the following:

        (a)  Each institution's board of directors must establish and maintain a Standards of Conduct Program that sets forth the core principles of § 612.2135 and meets the requirements of this subpart. The board must act to ensure the SOC program has adequate resources for its implementation and operation. The SOC program must include maintaining conflicts of interest and other reports required under this subpart, along with any investigations, determinations, and supporting documentation, for a minimum of 6 years.

        (b)  Each institution must have a Standards of Conduct Official who is appointed pursuant to § 612.2170. An institution may use one of its officers to serve as SOCO or may use a chartered service corporation or third-party to provide the services of a SOCO. Institutions may also use another institution's SOCO or hire a SOCO under a shared contract with other System institutions when each institution has a separate confidential relationship with the person serving as SOCO.

        (c)  Each institution as part of its SOC program must adopt and maintain an up-to-date written Code of Ethics. The Code must establish the institution's values and expectations for the ethical conduct of directors and employees in business transactions and include a general statement of expectations for appropriate professional conduct. The entire Code of Ethics must be available to all directors, employees, agents, and shareholders of the institution. The institution must post on its external website a statement that it has adopted a professional Code of Ethics, summarizing what that Code is, and advising the public the entire Code of Ethics is available on request at no cost.

        (d)  Each institution's board of directors must adopt policies and procedures to implement the institution's SOC program. These policies and procedures must address all aspects of the SOC program, including, but not limited to, the following:

        (1) Requiring conflict of interest reporting from all directors and employees pursuant to § 612.2145. The frequency of conflicts of interest reporting and other disclosures must be addressed in SOC program policies and procedures using the institution's fiscal year calendar. At a minimum, each person must annually report to the SOCO known conflicts occurring in the current year. Pursuant to § 612.2145(c), the board must also require directors and officers to give the SOCO the disclosures required under § 620.6(a), (e), and (f) of this chapter, regardless of who else in the institution receives the disclosures.

        (2) Explaining what constitutes SOC program compliance, including setting criteria for documentation submitted with conflicts of interest reports and providing instructions to help directors and employees identify and report on interests or circumstances that could give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest.

        (i) The board must explain within the policies and procedures what transactions are likely to present real or potential conflicts, setting benchmarks and thresholds for both single and aggregate activities. The policies and procedures must also explain how transactions in the ordinary course of business are identified.

        (ii) The board must explain within the policies and procedures, setting benchmarks and thresholds, how materiality of a conflict is identified. The materiality guidelines must be used when evaluating conflicts of interest reports filed by employees and directors. An exception for those matters affecting all shareholders or borrowers may be used in making the determination of materiality.

        (3) Addressing the process by which real and apparent conflicts will be resolved. The procedures must also explain action(s) to be taken when a conflict cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the institution. The procedures must explain the role and authorities of the SOCO in resolving conflicts.

        (4) Addressing the conduct of third-party relationships. The board of directors at each institution must adopt conflict-of-interest policies for third-party relationships and develop safeguards for use in contractual obligations that require third-party service providers to perform services on behalf of the institution in an ethical manner. At a minimum, the policies for third-party relationships must set forth expectations for disclosing known conflicts of interest to the institution. The policies must also implement the requirements of § 612.2180 for agents of the institution.

        (5) Setting criteria for accepting gifts that are not otherwise prohibited by this subpart. The criteria must explain the scope of application and may make appropriate exceptions for non-business events where the gift is not viewed by the institution as attempting to influence official institution business. The gift criteria must include de minimis dollar thresholds for all permissible gifts, regardless of the gift giving reason. The thresholds must apply both per gift and in the aggregate per recipient, per year. The institution must also establish disclosure requirements for gifts received as well as procedures for disposing of impermissible gifts.

        (6) Identifying the appropriate actions that may be taken against any director or employee who violates the standards of conduct policies and procedures, Code of Ethics, or regulations under this subpart. The board must also identify who is authorized to take which action and when. The board must address how the SOCO exercises his or her authority under § 612.2170 to investigate certain conduct issues.

        (7) Providing for anonymous reporting by individuals of known or suspected violations of the institution's Standards of Conduct Program and Code of Ethics, through a hotline or other venue.

        (e)  Each institution's board of directors must establish a system of internal controls for its SOC program that includes, at a minimum, a process to:

        (1) Protect against unauthorized disclosure of confidential information maintained by the institution.

        (2) Conduct scheduled periodic reviews of the Standards of Conduct Program that determine the continued adequacy of the program. Each review must look for consistency with institution practices, financial services industry best practices, and Farm Credit Administration (FCA) regulations in this chapter, identifying any required updates.

        (3) Perform internal audits of the Standards of Conduct Program. The board of directors, with the assistances of the SOCO and appropriate officers of the institution, must determine the scope and depth of the audit. The board is responsible for identifying who will conduct the internal audit. The audit findings must be given directly to the institution's board or designated board committee. The audit itself must be designed to:

        (i) Review the effectiveness of advancing the core principles;

        (ii) Identify weaknesses;

        (iii) Recommend and report necessary corrective actions; and

        (iv) Cover the entire Standards of Conduct Program across the institution, including all activities conducted through a System institution unincorporated business entity (UBE) formed under § 611.1150(b) of this chapter, including UBEs organized for the express purpose of investing in a Rural Business Investment Company.

        (f)  Each institution's board of directors must establish a training program to administer periodic Standards of Conduct and Code of Ethics training to directors and employees. The training must be given by the SOCO and the board must address how the SOCO will exercises his or her training responsibilities under § 612.2170. The Standards of Conduct training must be administered under the following timeframes:

        (1) Newly elected or appointed directors must receive Standards of Conduct training within 60 calendar days of the director assuming his or her position.

        (2) New employees must receive Standards of Conduct training within 10 business days of beginning work.

        (3) Periodic training for all directors and employees must occur at least annually but may be more frequent.

#### § § 612.2145

        (a)  As a director or employee of a System institution you must identify, disclose, and report on any interest or circumstances that does or could constitute a conflict of interest and potential conflict of interest. You must carry out this responsibility to the best of your knowledge and belief. You must cooperate with, and provide information requested by, the Standards of Conduct Official for use in determining the materiality of a conflict and to resolve conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest.

        (1) If you have a conflict of interest in a matter, transaction, or activity subject to official action by the institution or before the board of directors then you must disclose it and refrain from participating in official action or board discussion of the matter, transaction, or activity. You must also avoid voting on or influencing any decision directed at the matter, transaction, or activity.

        (2) You must report, either to the SOCO or by using the institution's anonymous reporting procedures, any known or suspected activity by a person affiliated with the institution that you suspect is illegal, unethical, or a violation of the institution's standards of conduct and Code of Ethics.

        (b)  As a director or employee of a System institution, you must file with the SOCO reports on any real or potential conflicts of interest. The reports must be filed at least annually and at such other times as may be required by your institution policies and procedures. The reports must be in sufficient detail for a reasonable person to make a conflict of interest determination and decide if the conflict is material. You must file a report with the SOCO that contains the disclosures required by this section and those required by the institution's SOC program policies and procedures. At a minimum, the report must be signed by you and include:

        (1) Any interest you have in any business matter, including any loan or loan application, to be considered by the System institution, or supervised or supervising institution in the current year;

        (2) All material financial interests, including those arising in the ordinary course of business, you have with any director, employee, agent, or borrower of your System institution, or a supervised or supervising institution;

        (3) The name(s) of your reportable business entities that you know or have reason to know in the current year transacted business with:

        (i) Your System institution;

        (ii) Any supervised or supervising institution; or

        (iii) A borrower that transacts business with your System institution, or any supervised or supervising institution.

        (4) The name(s) of your family members you know or have reason to know transacted business with your System institution or any supervised or supervising institution in the current year.

        (5) Reportable gifts received or disposed of under the institution's SOC program policies and procedures.

        (c)  If you are a director or officer at the institution, you must give the SOCO the disclosures required under § 620.6(a), (e), and (f) of this chapter, regardless of who else in the institution has been provided them. The timing and frequency of disclosing the information to the SOCO, or any updates to them, is determined by your institution's SOC program policies and procedures but must occur no less than annually and at issuance of the institution's Annual Meeting Information Statement.

        § 612.2150   Prohibited conduct.

#### § § 612.2150

        (a)  If you are a System institution director or employee you must not act inconsistently with the Standards of Conduct core principles set forth in this subpart. You also must not act in the following manner:

        (1)  Do not participate in deliberations on, or the determination of, any matter affecting your financial interest either directly or indirectly. Matters affecting your financial interest include financial interests of family or reportable business entities. You also may not use your position as a director or employee of the institution to obtain special advantage or favoritism for yourself, your family, or a reportable business entity. However, you may participate in matters of general applicability affecting shareholders or borrowers of a particular class if your participation occurs in a nondiscriminatory way.

        (2)  Do not make use of or disclose any fact, information, or document not generally available to the public that you acquired by virtue of your position as a director or employee of the institution. You may use confidential information in the performance of your official duties.

        (3)  Do not solicit, obtain, or accept (directly or indirectly), any gift, fee, or other compensation that is offered or requested based on your position as a director or employee of an institution if it could be viewed as being offered to influence your decision-making, an official action, or to obtain information related to your institution's operations.

        (4)  Do not knowingly purchase or otherwise acquire (directly or indirectly) any interest (including mineral interests) in any real or personal property that currently is owned, or within the past 12 months was owned, by your institution, your supervising institution, or institutions supervised by your institution as a result of foreclosure, deed in lieu, or similar action. The prohibition in this paragraph (a)(4) extends to property held or sold by a chartered service corporation or a System unincorporated business entity. The prohibition does not apply in the following situations:

        (i) You acquire the property by inheritance.

        (ii) You are exercising your rights of first refusal under section 4.36 of the Act.

        (iii) If you are a director of the institution, you may purchase property from a System institution when the property is sold through public auction or similar open, competitive bidding process. The exception in this paragraph (a)(4)(iii) only applies if you did not participate in the decision to foreclose upon the property nor did you participate in deciding how the institution would dispose of the property. Participating in these decisions includes setting the sale terms or receiving information as a result of your position with the institution that could give you an advantage over other potential bidders or purchasers of the property.

        (5)  Do not directly or indirectly borrow from, lend to, or become financially obligated with or on behalf of a director, employee, or agent of your institution, your supervising institution, or institution supervised by your institution.

The transaction prohibition does not apply to:

        (i) Transactions with family members.

        (ii) Transactions that occur in the ordinary course of business as determined and documented by the written policies and procedures of your institution.

        (iii) Transactions undertaken in an official capacity and in connection with the institution's discounting, lending, or participation relationships with other financing institutions (OFIs) and other lenders.

        (6)  Do not purchase any obligation of a System institution, including any joint, consolidated or System-wide obligation, unless such obligation is part of an offering available to the public and you either purchase it through a dealer or dealer bank affiliated with a member of the selling group designated by the Funding Corporation or purchase it in the secondary markets.

        (i) Do not purchase or retire any stock in advance of the release of material, non-public, information concerning the institution to other stockholders.

        (ii) If you are a director or employee of the Funding Corporation, do not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, except by inheritance, any obligation or equity of a System institution, including any joint, consolidated or System-wide obligations, unless it is a common cooperative equity as defined in § 628.2 of this chapter.

        (b)  In addition to the prohibitions under paragraph (a) of this section, if you are an institution employee you must not:

        (1)  Do not serve as a director or employee of any commercial bank, savings and loan, or other non-System financial institution. You may not serve as a director or employee of a non-System entity that transacts business with a System institution within your institution's district unless specifically allowed in this paragraph (b). For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(1), “transacts business” does not include loans by a System institution to a family-owned entity or a reportable business entity; service on the board of directors of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation; transactions with non-profit entities; or transactions with entities in which the System institution has an ownership interest. The prohibition in this paragraph (b)(1) does not apply in the following situations:

        (i) You may serve as a director or employee of an employee credit union.

        (ii) You may serve as a director of a cooperative that borrows from the System under the Act's Title III authorities if you are not employed at an institution with Title III lending authority and your employing institution approves your service on the cooperative's board.

        (2)  Do not act as a real estate agent or broker unless you are buying or selling real estate for your own use or for family.

        (3)  Do not act as an insurance agent or broker for the sale and placement of insurance, unless authorized by section 4.29 of the Act.

        (4)  Do not serve as an employee for your supervising institution if you are an officer at your association. Do not serve as an employee for a supervised institution if you are an officer at your Farm Credit bank. The prohibition in this paragraph (b)(4) does not apply in the following situations:

        (i) You may be both a non-officer employee at a Farm Credit bank and a supervised association if the employment expenses are appropriately reflected in each institution's financial statements.

        (ii) If you are currently employed with a Farm Credit bank as other than an officer, in extraordinary circumstances, FCA may approve your serving as an officer of a supervised association. This requires the boards at both institutions to agree to the joint service and for the duties and compensation at each institution to be delineated in the board approval documents. The board documents, along with the request, must be sent at least 10 business days before the effective date to the Director of Regulatory Policy, Farm Credit Administration.

#### § § 612.2180

        (a)  Agents of System institutions must maintain high standards of honesty, integrity, and impartiality in order to ensure the proper performance of System business and continued public confidence in the System and all its institutions. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards.

        (b)  Each institution must use safe and sound business practices in the engagement, utilization, and retention of agents. These practices shall provide for the selection of qualified and reputable agents. The institution is responsible for the administration of relationships with its agents and must take appropriate investigative and corrective action in the case of a breach of fiduciary duties by an agent or failure of an agent to carry out other duties as required by contract, FCA regulations in this chapter, or law.

        (c)  System institutions are responsible for exercising special diligence and control, through good business practices, to avoid or control situations that have inherent potential for sensitivity, either real or perceived. These areas include:

        (1) The employment of agents who are related to directors or employees of the institutions;

        (2) The solicitation and acceptance of gifts, contributions, or special considerations by agents; and

        (3) The use of System and borrower information obtained in the course of the agent's work with the institution.

**Source:** Source: 62 FR 24566, May 6, 1997, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 69 FR 10907, Mar. 9, 2004.

        § 612.2300   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 612.2300

        (a) This part applies to all institutions of the Farm Credit System as defined in section 1.2(a) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, (Act) (12 U.S.C. 2002(a)) including, but not limited to, associations, banks, service corporations chartered under section 4.25 of the Act, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter, institutions). The purposes of this part are to ensure public confidence in the Farm Credit System, to ensure the reporting of known or suspected criminal activity, to reduce potential losses to institutions, and to ensure the safety and soundness of institutions. This part requires that institutions use the Farm Credit Administration Criminal Referral Form (hereinafter FCA Referral Form) to notify the appropriate Federal authorities when any known or suspected Federal criminal violations of the type described in § 612.2301 are discovered by institutions.

        (b) The specific referral requirements of this part apply to known or suspected criminal violations of the United States Code involving the assets, operations, or affairs of an institution. This part prescribes procedures for referring those violations to the proper Federal authorities and the Farm Credit Administration. No specific procedural requirements apply to the referral of violations of State or local laws.

        (c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way an institution's ability to report known or suspected criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, whether Federal, State, or local, even when the circumstances in which a report is required under § 612.2301 are not present.

        (d) It shall be the responsibility of each System institution to determine whether there appears to be a reasonable basis to conclude that a criminal violation has been committed and, if so, to report the matter to the proper law enforcement authorities for consideration of prosecution.

        (e) Each referral required by § 612.2301(a) shall be made on the FCA Referral Form in accordance with the FCA Referral Form instructions relating to its filing and distribution.

#### § § 612.2301

        (a) Each institution and its board of directors shall exercise due diligence to ensure the discovery, appropriate investigation, and reporting of criminal activity. Within 30 calendar days of determining that there is a known or suspected criminal violation of the United States Code involving or affecting its assets, operations, or affairs, the institution shall refer such criminal violation to the appropriate regional offices of the United States Attorney, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the United States Secret Service or both, using the FCA Referral Form. A copy of the completed FCA Referral Form, accompanied by any relevant documentation, shall be provided at the same time to the Farm Credit Administration's Office of General Counsel. In the event that a Farm Credit bank makes a loan through a Federal land bank association which services the loan, the Federal land bank association must inform the Farm Credit bank of any known or suspected violation involving that loan and the Farm Credit bank shall refer the violation to Federal law enforcement authorities under this section. A report is required in circumstances where there is:

        (1) Any known or suspected criminal activity (e.g., theft, embezzlement), mysterious disappearance, unexplained shortage, misapplication, or other defalcation of property and/or funds, regardless of amount, where an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution is suspected;

        (2) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss of $5,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects and the suspect(s) is not an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution;

        (3) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss of $25,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or

        (4) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving a financial transaction in which the institution was used as a conduit for such criminal activity (such as money laundering/structuring schemes).

        (b) In circumstances where there is a known or suspected violation of State or local criminal law, the institution shall notify the appropriate State or local law enforcement authorities.

        (c) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the institution shall immediately notify by telephone the appropriate Federal law enforcement authorities and FCA offices specified on the FCA Referral Form upon determining that a known or suspected criminal violation of Federal law requiring urgent attention has occurred or is ongoing. Such cases include, but are not limited to, those where:

        (1) There is a likelihood that the suspect(s) will flee;

        (2) The magnitude or the continuation of the known or suspected criminal violation may imperil the institution's continued operation; or

        (3) Key institution personnel are involved.

        § 612.2302   Notification of board of directors and bonding company.

#### § § 612.2302

        (a) The institution's board of directors shall be promptly notified of any criminal referral by the institution, except that if the criminal referral involves a member of the board of directors, discretion may be exercised in notifying such member of the referral.

        (b) The institution involved shall promptly make all required notifications under any applicable surety bond or other contract for protection.

        § 612.2303   Institution responsibilities.

**Source:** Source: 62 FR 4441, Jan. 30, 1997, unless otherwise noted.

        § 613.3000   Financing for farmers, ranchers, and aquatic producers or harvesters.

#### § § 613.3000

        (a)  For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

        (1)  means a person owning agricultural land or engaged in the production of agricultural products, including aquatic products under controlled conditions.

        (2)  means any partnership, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal entity that is established pursuant to the laws of the United States, any State thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, or any tribal authority and is legally authorized to conduct a business.

        (3)  means a legal entity or an individual who is a citizen of the United States or a foreign national who has been lawfully admitted into the United States either for permanent residency pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or on a visa pursuant to a provision in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) that authorizes such individual to own property or operate or manage a business or a legal entity.

        (4)  means a person engaged in producing or harvesting aquatic products for economic gain in open waters under uncontrolled conditions.

        (b)  Farm Credit institutions that operate under titles I or II of the Act may provide financing to a bona fide farmer or rancher, or producer or harvester of aquatic products for any agricultural or aquatic purpose and for other credit needs.

> [62 FR 4441, Jan. 30, 1997, as amended at 73 FR 30475, May 28, 2008]

        § 613.3005   Lending objective.

#### § § 613.3005

        It is the objective of each bank and association, except for banks for cooperatives, to provide full credit, to the extent of creditworthiness, to the full-time bona fide farmer (one whose primary business and vocation is farming, ranching, or producing or harvesting aquatic products); and conservative credit to less than full-time farmers for agricultural enterprises, and more restricted credit for other credit requirements as needed to ensure a sound credit package or to accommodate a borrower's needs as long as the total credit results in being primarily an agricultural loan. However, the part-time farmer who needs to seek off-farm employment to supplement farm income or who desires to supplement off-farm income by living in a rural area and is carrying on a valid agricultural operation, shall have availability of credit for mortgages, other agricultural purposes, and family needs in the preferred position along with full-time farmers. Loans to farmers shall be on an increasingly conservative basis as the emphasis moves away from the full-time bona fide farmer to the point where agricultural needs only will be financed for the applicant whose business is essentially other than farming. Credit shall not be extended where investment in agricultural assets for speculative appreciation is a primary factor.

        § 613.3010   Financing for processing or marketing operations.

#### § § 613.3010

        (a)  A borrower is eligible for financing for a processing or marketing operation under titles I and II of the Act only if the borrower:

        (i) Exercise majority voting control over the legal entity; or

        (ii) Constitute a majority of the directors of a corporation, general partners of a limited partnership, or managing members of a limited liability company who exercise control over the legal entity by determining and overseeing the policies, business practices, management, and decision-making process of the legal entity; or

        (B) At least 50 percent of the eligible borrower's total output of the commodity processed or marketed.

        (b)  Processing or marketing loans to eligible borrowers who regularly supply less than 20 percent of the throughput are subject to the following restrictions:

        (1)  The aggregate of such processing and marketing loans made by a Farm Credit bank shall not exceed 15 percent of all its outstanding retail loans at the end of the preceding fiscal year.

        (2)  The aggregate of such processing and marketing loans made by all direct lender associations affiliated with the same Farm Credit bank shall not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate of their outstanding retail loans at the end of the preceding fiscal year.

        (3) Procedures for determining functional integration for loans made under paragraph (a)(5) of this section that require consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, which include the extent to which:

        (i) The operations share resources such as management, employees, facilities, and equipment;

        (ii) The operations are conducted in coordination with or reliance upon each other; and

        (iii) The eligible borrower and legal entity are dependent upon each other for economic success.

        § 614.4170   General.

#### § § 614.4170

        Direct lenders shall be responsible for the servicing of the loans that they make. However, loan participation agreements may designate specific loan servicing efforts to be accomplished by a participating institution. Each direct lender shall adopt loan servicing policies and procedures to assure that loans will be serviced fairly and equitably for the borrower while minimizing the risk for the lender. Procedures shall include specific plans that help preserve the quality of sound loans and that help correct credit deficiencies as they develop.

        (a) The Farm Credit Bank shall provide guidelines for the servicing of loans by the Federal land bank associations. The servicing may be accomplished either under the direct supervision of the bank or under delegated authority.

        (b) The servicing of loans which are participated in by Farm Credit System institutions shall be in accordance with § 614.4325.

        (c) In the development of loan servicing policies and procedures, the following criteria shall be included:

        (1)  The objective shall be to provide borrowers with prompt and efficient service with respect to actions in such areas as personal liability, partial release of security, insurance requirements or adjustments, loan divisions or transfers, or conditional payments. Procedures shall provide for adequate inspections, reanalyses, reappraisals, controls on payment of insurance and taxes (and for payment when necessary), and prompt exercise of legal options to preserve the lender's collateral position or guard against loss. Loan servicing policies for rural home loans shall recognize the inherent differences between agricultural and rural home lending.

        (2)  The objective shall be to service such loans to assure disbursement in accordance with the basis of approval, repayment from the sources obligated or pledged, and to minimize risk exposure to the lender. Procedures shall require:

        (i) The procurement of periodic operating data essential for maintaining control, for the proper analysis of such data, and prompt action as needed;

        (ii) Inspections, reappraisals, and borrower visits appropriate to the nature and quality of the loan; and

        (iii) Controls on insurance, margin requirements, warehousing, and the prompt exercise of legal options to preserve the lender's collateral position and guard against loss.

        (3)  In addition to the foregoing servicing objectives for term and operating loans, procedures for servicing these loans shall require procurement of data on changes in ownership, control, and management; review of business objectives, financing programs, organizational structure, and operating methods, and appropriate analysis of such changes with provision for action as needed.

        (a) Borrowers may make voluntary advance payments on their loans or, under agreement with a System institution, may make voluntary advance conditional payments intended to be applied to future maturities. The monies in the advance conditional payment accounts may be available for return to the borrower in lieu of increasing his loan. System institutions may pay interest on advance conditional payments for the time the funds are held unapplied at a rate not to exceed the rate charged on the related loan(s). System institutions shall hold any advance conditional payments received in accordance with this section in voluntary advance payment accounts.

        (b) System institutions may establish involuntary payment accounts including, but not limited to, funds held for the borrower, such as loan proceeds to be disbursed for which the borrower is obligated; the unapplied insurance proceeds arising from any insured loss; and total insurance premiums and applicable taxes collected in advance in connection with any loan.

      Subpart E—Loan Terms and Conditions

**Source:** Source: 55 FR 24884, June 19, 1990, unless otherwise noted.

        § 614.4200   General requirements.

#### § § 614.4200

        (a)  (1) The terms and conditions of each loan made by a Farm Credit bank or association shall be set forth in a written document or documents, such as a loan agreement, promissory note, or other instrument(s) appropriate to the type and amount of the credit extension, in order to establish loan conditions and performance requirements. Copies of all documents executed by the borrower in connection with the closing of a loan made under titles I or II of the Act shall be provided to the borrower at the time of execution and at any time thereafter that the borrower requests additional copies.

        (2) The terms and conditions of all loans shall be adequately disclosed in writing to the borrower not later than loan closing. For loans made under titles I and II of the Act, the institution shall provide prompt written notice of the approval of the loan.

        (3) Applicants shall be provided notification of the action taken on each credit application in compliance with the requirements of 12 CFR 202.9.

        (b)  (1) Long-term real estate mortgage loans must be secured by a first lien interest in real estate, except that the loans may be secured by a second lien interest if the institution also holds the first lien on the property. No funds shall be advanced, under a legally binding commitment or otherwise, if the outstanding loan balance after the advance would exceed 85 percent (or 97 percent as provided in section 1.10(a) of the Act) of the appraised value of the real estate, except that a loan on which private mortgage insurance is obtained may exceed 85 percent of the appraised value of the real estate to the extent that the loan amount in excess of 85 percent is covered by such insurance. The real estate that is used to satisfy the loan-to-value limitation must be comprised primarily of agricultural or rural property, including agricultural land and improvements thereto, a farm-related business, a marketing or processing operation, a rural residence, or real estate used as an integral part of an aquatic operation.

        (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the lending institution may advance funds for the payment of taxes or insurance premiums with respect to the real estate, reschedule loan payments, grant partial releases of security interests in the real estate, and take other actions necessary to protect the lender's collateral position. Any action taken that results in exceeding the loan-to-value limitation shall be in accordance with a policy of the institution's board of directors and adequately documented in the loan file.

        (3) Short- and intermediate-term loans may be secured or unsecured as the documented creditworthiness of the borrower warrants.

        (4) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a long-term, non-farm rural home loan, including a revolving line of credit, shall be secured by a first lien on the property, except that it may be secured by a second lien if the institution also holds the first lien on the property. A short- or intermediate-term loan on a rural home, including a revolving line of credit, must be secured by a lien on the property unless the financing is provided exclusively for repairs, remodeling, or other improvements to the rural home, in which case the loan may be secured by other property or unsecured if warranted by the documented creditworthiness of the borrower.

        (5) Except as provided in § 614.4231, loans made under title III of the Act may be secured or unsecured, as appropriate for the purpose of the loan and the documented creditworthiness of the borrower.

        (c)  If a direct lender amortizes a loan over a period of time that is longer than the term to maturity under § 614.4000(a), § 614.4010(a), § 614.4030(a), § 614.41040(a), or § 614.4050(a)(1) or (2), it must establish a loan amortization schedule that is:

        (1) Consistent with its loan underwriting standards adopted pursuant to § 614.4150; and

        (2) Appropriate to the type and purpose of the loan, expected useful life of the asset being financed, and the repayment capacity of the borrower.

        (a) The term of the loan shall not be longer than the total period of the lease;

        (b) The contract between the lessor and lessee shall establish that the leased assets are effectively under the control of the lessee and that such control shall continue in effect for essentially all of the term of the lease;

        (c) The lessee must hold at least one share of stock or one participation certificate; and

        Term loans made by banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks under the authority of section 3.7(b) of the Act and § 613.3200 of this chapter to foreign or domestic parties who are not shareholders of the bank shall be subject to the following conditions:

        (a) The loan shall be denominated in a currency to eliminate foreign exchange risk on repayment.

        (b) The borrower's obligations shall be guaranteed or insured against default under such policies as are available in the United States and other countries. Exceptions may be made where a prospective borrower has had a longstanding successful business relationship with an eligible cooperative borrower or an eligible cooperative which is not a borrower if the prospective borrower has a high credit rating as determined by the bank.

        (c) For a borrower in which a voting stockholder of the bank has a majority ownership interest, financing may be extended for the full value of the transaction; otherwise, financing may be extended only to approximate the percent of ownership.

      Subpart F—Collateral Evaluation Requirements

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 46730, Sept. 12, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

        § 614.4240   Collateral definitions.

#### § § 614.4240

        For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:

        (a)  when used to describe decisions to require collateral, means that the collateral is taken in circumstances in which:

        (1) It is not required by statute, regulation, or the institution's policies; and

        (2) A prudent lender would extend credit based on a borrower's income and/or other collateral, absent the real estate, and the decision to extend credit was, in fact, based on other sources of revenue or collateral.

        (b)  means a written statement independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion as to the market value of an adequately described property as of a specific date(s), supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant market information.

        (c)  means the _Appraisal Foundation_ established on November 30, 1987, by professional appraisal organizations, as a not-for-profit corporation under the laws of Illinois, in order to enhance the quality of professional appraisals.

        (f)  means the process by which an evaluator establishes an indicated value by measuring the current market cost to construct a reproduction of or replacement for the improvements, minus the amount of depreciation (physical deterioration, or functional and/or external obsolescence) evident in the structure from all causes, plus the market value of the land.

        (g)  means a study of the nature, quality, or utility of, interest in, or aspects of, an asset. An evaluation may take the form of a valuation or an appraisal.

        (h)  means a qualified evaluator who is not an employee of the party contracting for the completion of the evaluation and who performs an evaluation on a fee basis. For purposes of this subpart, a fee appraiser may include a staff evaluator from another Farm Credit System institution only if the employing institution is not operating under joint management with the contracting institution. In addition, for purposes of personal and intangible collateral evaluations, the term “fee appraiser” includes, but is not limited to, certified public accountants, equipment dealers, grain buyers, livestock buyers, and auctioneers.

        (i)  means the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and Enforcement Act of 1989.

        (j)  means the reasonable and most probable use of the property that would result in the highest market value of vacant land or improved property, as of the date of valuation; or that use, from among reasonably probable and legally alternative uses, found to be physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and which results in the highest land value.

        (k)  means the procedure that values property by measuring the present value of the expected future benefits of property ownership. This value is derived from either:

        (1) Capitalizing a single year's income expectancy or an annual average of several years' income expectancies at a market-derived capitalization rate that reflects a specific income pattern, return on investment, and change in the value of the investment; or

        (2) Discounting the annual cashflows for the holding period and the reversion at a specified yield rate or specified yield rates which reflect market behavior.

        (l)  means the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and assuming neither is under duress. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:

        (1) Buyer and seller are typically motivated;

        (2) Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;

        (3) A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;

        (4) Payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and

        (5) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

        (m)  for purposes of this subpart, means all tangible and movable property not considered real property or fixtures.

        (n)  means an individual who is competent, reputable, impartial, and has demonstrated sufficient training and experience to properly evaluate property of the type that is the subject of the evaluation.

        (1) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in, or exchange of real property, including interests in property or the financing thereof; or

        (2) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; or

        (3) The use of real property or interests in real property as security for a loan or investment, including mortgage-backed securities.

        (q)  means all interests, benefits, and rights inherent in the ownership of real estate.

        (r)  means the procedure that values property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located in relatively close proximity, having similar size and utility, and having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate the degree of similarity and difference between the subject property and comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of conditions of sale, financing terms, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities of the subject property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property could be sold on the date of the collateral evaluation.

        (s)  means any individual who has satisfied the requirements for and has been certified as a real estate appraiser by a State or territory whose requirements for certification currently meet or exceed the minimum criteria for certification issued by the Appraiser Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. No individual shall be a _State certified appraiser_ unless such individual has achieved a passing grade on a suitable examination administered by a State or territory that is consistent with and equivalent to the Uniform State Certification Examination issued or endorsed by the Appraiser Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. In addition, the Appraisal Subcommittee must not have issued a finding that the policies, practices, or procedures of the State or territory are inconsistent with title XI of FIRREA.

        (t)  means any individual who has satisfied the requirements for licensing and has been licensed as a real estate appraiser by a State or territory in which the licensing procedures comply with title XI of FIRREA and in which the Appraisal Subcommittee has not issued a finding that the policies, practices, or procedures of the State or territory are inconsistent with title XI of FIRREA.

        (u)  means:

        (1) For loans or other extensions of credit, the amount of the loan, loan commitment, or other extensions of credit;

        (2) For sales, leases, purchases, investments in, or exchanges of real property, the market value of the property interest involved; and

        (3) For the pools of loans or interests in real property, the transaction value of the individual loans or the market value of the real property interests comprising the pool.

        (v)  means the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice adopted by the Appraisal Foundation.

        (w)  means the process of estimating a defined value of an identified interest or interests in a specific asset or assets as of a given date. A valuation results from the completion of a collateral evaluation that does not require an appraisal.

        § 614.4245   Collateral evaluation policies.

#### § § 614.4245

        (a) The board of directors of each Farm Credit System institution that engages in lending or leasing secured by collateral shall adopt well-defined and effective collateral evaluation policies and standards, that comply with the regulations in this subpart, to ensure that collateral evaluations are:

        (1) Sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide ample support to the institution's related credit decisions;

        (2) Performed based on criteria established for the purpose of determining the circumstances under which collateral evaluations will be required and when they will be required. Such criteria must, at a minimum:

        (i) Establish when an institution will require a collateral appraisal completed under the USPAP rather than a collateral valuation; and

        (ii) Take into account such factors as market trends, market volatility, and various types of credit, loan servicing, collection, and liquidation actions; and

        (3) Completed by a qualified evaluator in an unbiased manner.

        (b) The policies and standards required by this section shall, at a minimum, address the criteria outlined in §§ 614.4250 through 614.4267 of this subpart.

        (c) A Federal land bank association shall, with the approval of its respective Farm Credit bank, adopt collateral evaluation policies that are consistent with the bank's policies and standards.

        (d) An institution's board of directors may adopt specific collateral evaluation requirements, consistent with the regulations in this subpart, for loans designated as part of a minimum information program.

        § 614.4250   Collateral evaluation standards.

#### § § 614.4250

        (a) When real, personal, or intangible property is taken as security for a loan or is the subject of a lease, an evaluation of such property shall be performed in accordance with § 614.4260 and the institutions' policies and procedures. Such a collateral evaluation shall be identified as either a collateral valuation or a collateral appraisal. Specifically, all collateral evaluations must:

        (1) Value the subject property based upon market value as defined in § 614.4240(l);

        (2) Be presented in a written format;

        (3) Consider the purpose for which the property will be used and the property's highest and best use, if different from the intended use;

        (4) Be sufficiently descriptive to enable the reader to ascertain the reasonableness of the estimated market value and the rationale for the estimate;

        (5) Provide sufficient detail (including an identification and description of the property) and depth of analysis to reflect the relevant characteristics and complexity of the subject property;

        (6) Analyze and report, as appropriate, for real, intangible, and/or personal property, on:

        (i) The current income producing capacity of the property;

        (ii) A reasonable marketing period for the property;

        (iii) The current market conditions and trends that will affect projected income, to the extent such conditions will affect the value of the property;

        (iv) The appropriate deductions and discounts as they would apply to the property, including but not limited to, those based on the condition of the property, as well as the specialization of the operation and property; and

        (v) Potential liabilities, including those associated with any hazardous waste or other environmental concerns; and

        (7) Include in the evaluation report a certification that the evaluation was not based on a requested minimum valuation or specific valuation or approval of a loan.

        (b) For purposes of determining appraisal value as required in section 1.10(a) of the Act, the definition of market value and the requirements of this subpart shall apply.

        § 614.4255   Independence requirements.

        (1) A Farm Credit System institution making or originating the loan;

        (3) A lien on real property has been taken as collateral in an abundance of caution, and the application, when evaluated on the five basic credit factors, without considering the subject real estate, would support the credit decision that was based on other sources of repayment or collateral;

        (4) A lien on real estate is not statutorily required and has been taken for purposes other than the real estate's value;

        (5) Subsequent loan transactions (which include but are not limited to loan servicing actions, reamortizations, modifications of loan terms, and partial releases), provided that either:

        (i) The transaction does not involve the advancement of new loan funds other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; or

In addition, the institution must document that the repayment of a “business loan” is not dependent on income derived from the sale or cash rental of real estate.

        (d)  The FCA reserves the right to require an appraisal under this subpart whenever it believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness issues.

        (1) The appraiser is qualified to perform such appraisals;

        (2) The applicable Farm Credit System institution has established policies providing for such interstate appraisals; and

        (ii) Has an obligation to make payments of principal or interest to any party resulting from:

        (B) Changes in the market value of the assets after transfer;

        (iv) Determines whether each loan purchased, except for loans purchased that could be financed only by a bank for cooperatives under title III of the Act, is a distressed loan as defined in § 617.7000, and provides borrowers of purchased loans who acquire voting stock the rights afforded in § 617.7000, subparts A, and D through G if the loan is distressed; and

        (v) Divests eligible purchased loans when the borrowers elect not to acquire stock under the program offered in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section in the same manner it would divest loans under its current business practices.

        (5) Provision for the identification and reporting of loans in which interests are sold or purchased;

        (6) Requirements for providing and securing in a timely manner adequate credit and other information needed to make an independent credit judgment; and

        (7) Any limitations or conditions to which sales or purchases are subject that the board deems appropriate, including arbitration.

        (d)  Agreements to purchase or sell an interest in a loan shall, at a minimum:

        (1) Identify the particular loan(s) to be covered by the agreement;

        (2) Provide for the transfer of credit and other borrower information on a timely and continuing basis;

        (3) Provide for sharing, dividing, or assigning collateral;

        (4) Identify the nature of the interest(s) sold or purchased;

        (5) Set forth the rights and obligations of the parties and the terms and conditions of the sale; and

        (6) Contain any terms necessary for the appropriate administration of the loan and the protection of the interests of the Farm Credit System institution.

A Farm Credit System institution that purchases a loan or any interest therein may use information, such as appraisals or collateral inspections, furnished by the originating or lead lender, or any intermediary seller or broker; however, the purchasing Farm Credit System institution shall independently evaluate such information when exercising its independent credit judgment. No employee who performed a real estate appraisal on any collateral supporting a loan shall participate in the decision to purchase that loan. The independent credit judgment shall be documented by a credit analysis that considers factors set forth in the loan underwriting standards adopted pursuant to § 614.4150 of this part and is independent of the originating institution and any intermediary seller or broker. The credit analysis shall consider such credit and other borrower information as would be required by a prudent lender and shall include an evaluation of the capacity and reliability of the servicer. Boards of directors of jointly managed institutions shall adopt procedures to ensure that the interests of their respective shareholders are protected in participation between such institutions.

        (f)  The aggregate principal amount of interests in loans purchased from a single lead lender and the aggregate principal amount of interests in loans purchased from other institutions shall not exceed the limits set in the institution's policy.

        (g)  When a loan or interest in a loan is sold with recourse, it shall be accorded the following treatment:

        (1) The loan shall be considered, to the extent of the recourse, an extension of credit by the purchaser to the seller, as well as an extension of credit from the seller to the borrower(s), for the purpose of determining whether credit extensions to a borrower are within the lending limits established in subpart J of this part.

        (2) The amount of the loan subject to the recourse agreement shall be considered a loan sold with recourse for the purpose of computing permanent capital ratios.

        (h)  Transactions pertaining to purchases of loans, including the judgement on creditworthiness, may be performed through an agent, provided that:

        (1) The institution establishes the necessary criteria in a written agency agreement that outlines, at a minimum, the scope of the agency relationship and obligates the agent to comply with the institution's underwriting standards;

        (2) The institution periodically reviews the agency relationship to determine if the agent's actions are in the best interest of the institution;

        (3) The agent must be independent of the seller or intermediate broker in the transaction; and

        (4) If an association's funding bank serves as its agent, the agency agreement must provide that:

        (i) The association can terminate the agreement upon no more than 60 days notice to the bank;

        (ii) The association may, in its discretion, require the bank to purchase from the association any interest in a loan that the association determines does not comply with the terms of the agency agreement or the association's loan underwriting standards.

#### § § 614.4358

        (a)  The computation of total loans to each borrower for the purpose of computing their lending and leasing limit shall include:

        (1) The total unpaid principal of all loans and lease balances outstanding and the total amount of undisbursed commitments except as excluded by paragraph (b) of this section. This amount shall include loans that have been charged off on the books of the institution in whole or in part but have not been collected, except to the extent that such amounts are not legally collectible;

        (2) Purchased interests in loans, including participation interests, to the extent of the amount of the purchased interest, including any undisbursed commitment;

        (3) Loans attributed to a borrower in accordance with § 614.4359.

        (b)  The following loans when adequately documented in the loan file, may be excluded from loans to a borrower subject to the lending and leasing limit:

        (1) Any loan or portion of a loan that carries a full faith and credit performance guaranty or surety of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission, or establishment of the United States government, provided there is no evidence to suggest that the guaranty has become unenforceable and the institution can demonstrate that it is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the guaranty.

        (2) Any loan or portion of a loan guaranteed by a Farm Credit System institution, pursuant to the provisions of § 614.4345 on guaranty agreements. This exclusion does not apply to the institution providing the guaranty.

        (3) Any loan or portion of a loan that is secured by bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or by other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States government, provided the loans are fully secured by the current market value of such obligations. If the market value of the collateral declines to below the balance of the loan, and the entire loan, individually, or when combined with other loans and undisbursed commitments to or attributed to the borrower, causes the borrower's total indebtedness to exceed the institution's lending limit, the institution shall have 5 business days to bring the loan into conformance before it shall be deemed to be in violation of the lending limit.

        (4) Interests in loans sold, including participation interests, when the sale agreement meets the following requirements:

        (ii) The agreement under which the interest is sold must provide for the sharing of all payments of principal, collection expenses, collateral proceeds, and risk of loss on a pro rata basis according to the percentage interest in the principal amount of the loan. Agreements that provide for the pro rata sharing to commence at the time of default or similar event, as defined in the agreement under which the interest is sold, shall be considered to be pro rata agreements, notwithstanding the fact that advances are made and payments are distributed on a basis other than pro rata prior to that time.

        (5) Interests in leases sold when the sale agreement provides that:

        (i) The interest sold must be:

        (A) An undivided interest in all the lease payments or the residual value of all the leased property; or

        (B) A fractional undivided interest in the total lease transaction;

        (ii) The interest must be sold without recourse; and

        (iii) Sharing of all lease payments must be on a pro rata basis according to the percentage interest in the lease payments.

        § 614.4359   Attribution rules.

#### § § 614.4359

        (a) For the purpose of applying the lending and leasing limit to the indebtedness of a borrower, loans to a related borrower shall be combined with loans outstanding to the borrower and attributed to the borrower when any one of the following three conditions exist:

        (1)  (i) The borrower has primary or secondary liability on a loan made to the related borrower. The amount of such loan attributable to the borrower is limited to the amount of the borrower's liability.

        (ii) This section does not require attribution of a guarantee taken out of an abundance of caution. To qualify for the abundance of caution exception to the requirements of this subpart, the institution must document in the loan file that the loan, when evaluated under the loan underwriting standards adopted pursuant to § 614.4150 of this part without considering the guarantee, would support the credit decision under the same basic terms and conditions.

        (iii) For the banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks operating under title III authorities of the Act, look-through notes are exempt from the lending limit provisions provided they meet the criteria of § 614.4357.

        (2)  The operations of a borrower and related borrower are financially interdependent. Financial interdependence exists if the borrower is the primary source of repayment for a related borrower's loan, or if the operations of the borrower and the related borrower are commingled.

        (i) The borrower shall be considered the primary source of repayment on the loan to the related borrower if the borrower is obligated to supply 50 percent or more of the related borrower's annual gross receipts,  reliance on the income from one another is such that, regardless of the solvency _and_ liquidity of the borrower's operations, the debt service obligation of the related borrower could not be met if income flow from the borrower is interrupted or terminated. For the purpose of this paragraph, gross receipts include, but are not limited to, revenues, intercompany loans, dividends and capital contributions.

        (ii) The assets or operations of the borrower and related borrower are considered to be commingled if they cannot be separated without materially impacting the economic survival of the individual operations and their ability to repay their loans.

        (3)  The borrower directly or indirectly controls the related borrower. A borrower is deemed to control a related borrower if either paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section exist:

        (i) The borrower, directly or acting through one or more other persons, owns 50 percent or more of the stock of the related borrower; or

        (ii) The borrower, directly or acting through one or more other persons, owns or has the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting stock of a related borrower, and meets at least one of the following three conditions:

        (A) The borrower shares a common directorate or management with a related borrower. A common directorate is deemed to exist when a majority of the directors, trustees, or other persons performing similar functions of one borrower also serves the other borrower in a like capacity. A common management is deemed to exist if any employee of the borrower holds the position of chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, or an equivalent position in the related borrower's organization.

        (B) The borrower controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors of a related borrower.

        (C) The borrower exercises or has the power to exercise a controlling influence over management of a related borrower's operations through the provisions of management placement or marketing agreements, or providing services such as insurance carrier or bookkeeping.

        (b) Each institution shall make provisions for appropriately designating loans to a related borrower that are combined with the borrower's loan and attributed to the borrower to ensure that loans to the borrower are within the lending and leasing limits.

        (c)  For the purposes of applying the lending and leasing limit to the indebtedness of a borrower, loans to a related borrower shall be combined with loans outstanding to the borrower and attributed to the borrower when any one of three attribution rules are met as outlined in Table 1.

Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, loans which are in violation of the lending and leasing limit shall comply with the provisions of § 615.5090 of this chapter.

        (b) Under the following conditions a loan that violates the lending and leasing limit shall be exempt from the provisions of § 615.5090 of this chapter:

        (1) A loan in which the total amount of principal outstanding and undisbursed commitments exceed the lending and leasing limit because of a decline in permanent capital after the loan was made.

        (2) Loans on which funds are advanced pursuant to a commitment that was within the lending and leasing limit at the time the commitment was made, even if the lending and leasing limit subsequently declines.

        (3) A loan that exceeds the lending and leasing limit as a result of the consolidation of the debt of two or more borrowers as a consequence of a merger or the acquisition of one borrower's operations by another borrower. Such a loan may be extended or renewed, for a period not to exceed 1 year from the date of such merger or acquisition, during which period the institution may advance and/or readvance funds not to exceed the greater of:

        (i) 110 percent of the advances to the borrower in the prior calendar year; or

        (ii) 110 percent of the average of the advances to the borrower in the past 3 calendar years.

        (c) For all lending and leasing limit violations except those exempted under § 614.4360(b)(3), within 90 days of the identification of the violation, the institution must develop a written plan prescribing the specific actions that will be taken by the institution to bring the total amount of loans and commitments outstanding or attributed to that borrower within the new lending and leasing limit, and must document the plan in the loan file.

        (d) All leases, except those permitted under § 614.4361, reading “effective date of this subpart” in § 614.4361(a) and “effective date of these regulations” in § 614.4361(b) as “effective date of this amendment,” must comply with the lending and leasing limit on the date the lease is made, and at all times after that.

        (e) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the FCA to take administrative action, including, but not limited to, monetary penalties, as a result of lending and leasing limit violations.

A new loan must conform with the rules set forth in this subpart. A new loan includes but is not limited to:

        (1) Funds advanced in excess of existing commitment;

        (2) A different borrower is substituted for a borrower who is subsequently released; or

        (3) An additional person becomes an obligor on the loan.

        (b) A commitment made prior to the effective date of these regulations which exceeds the lending and leasing limit may be funded to the full extent of the legal commitment. Any advances that exceed the lending and leasing limit are subject to the provisions prescribed in § 614.4360.

#### § § 614.4362

        The board of directors of each title I, II, and III System institution must adopt and ensure implementation of a written policy to effectively measure, limit and monitor exposures to concentration risks resulting from the institution's lending and leasing activities.

        (a)  The policy must include:

        (1) A purpose and objective;

        (2) Clearly defined and consistently used terms;

        (3) Quantitative methods to measure and limit identified exposures to significant and reasonably foreseeable loan and lease concentration risks (as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section); and

        (4) Internal controls that delineate authorities delegated to management, authorities retained by the board, and a process for addressing exceptions and reporting requirements.

        (b)  (1) At a minimum, the quantitative methods included in the policy must measure and limit identified exposures to significant and reasonably foreseeable concentration risks emanating from:

        (i) A single borrower;

        (ii) A single-industry sector;

        (iii) A single counterparty; or

        (iv) Other lending activities unique to the institution because of its territory, the nature and scope of its activities and its risk-bearing capacity.

        (2) In determining concentration limits, the policy must consider other risk factors that could identify significant and reasonably foreseeable loan and lease losses. Such risk factors could include borrower risk ratings, the institution's relationship with the borrower, the borrower's knowledge and experience, loan structure and purpose, type or location of collateral (including loss given default ratings), loans to emerging industries or industries outside of an institution's area of expertise, out-of-territory loans, counterparties, or weaknesses in due diligence practices.

        (1) “A structure that is a part of a residential property” is a structure used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and not used primarily for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or other business purposes;

        (2) A structure is “detached” from the primary residential structure if it is not joined by any structural connection to that structure; and

        § 614.4935   Escrow requirement.

#### § § 614.4935

        (a) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (c) of this section, a System institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under § 614.4930 for any designated loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, payable with the same frequency as payments on the designated loan are required to be made for the duration of the loan.

        (2)  Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if:

        (i) The loan is an extension of credit primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes;

        (ii) The loan is in a subordinate position to a senior lien secured by the same residential improved real estate or mobile home for which the borrower has obtained flood insurance coverage that meets the requirements of § 614.4930;

        (iii) Flood insurance coverage for the residential improved real estate or mobile home is provided by a policy that:

        (A) Meets the requirements of § 614.4930;

        (B) Is provided by a condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group; and

        (C) The premium for which is paid by the condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group as a common expense;

        (iv) The loan is a home equity line of credit;

        (v) The loan is a nonperforming loan, which is a loan that is 90 or more days past due and remains nonperforming until it is permanently modified or until the entire amount past due, including principal, accrued interest, and penalty interest incurred as the result of past due status, is collected or otherwise discharged in full; or

        (vi) The loan has a term of no longer than 12 months.

        (3)  If a System institution, or a servicer acting its behalf, determines at any time during the term of a designated loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, that an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, then the System institution, or the servicer acting on its behalf, shall require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under § 614.4930 as soon as reasonably practicable and, if applicable, shall provide any disclosure required under section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA).

        (4)  The System institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall deposit the flood insurance premiums and fees on behalf of the borrower in an escrow account. This escrow account will be subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to section 10 of RESPA, which generally limits the amount that may be maintained in escrow accounts for certain types of loans and requires escrow account statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the Administrator of FEMA or other provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the System institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall pay the amount owed to the insurance provider from the escrow account by the date when such premiums are due.

        (c) —(1)  Except as may be required under applicable State law, paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section do not apply to a System institution:

        (i) That has total assets of less than $1 billion as of December 31 of either of the two prior calendar years; and

        (B) Did not have a policy of consistently and uniformly requiring the deposit of taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges in an escrow account for any loans secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home.

        (2)  If a System institution previously qualified for the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but no longer qualifies for the exception because it had assets of $1 billion or more for two consecutive calendar year ends, the System institution must escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section for any designated loan made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after July 1 of the first calendar year of changed status.

        (d) —(1)  A System institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall offer and make available to the borrower the option to escrow all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under § 614.4930 for any loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is outstanding on January 1, 2016, or July 1 of the first calendar year in which the System institution has had a change in status pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, unless:

        (i) The loan or the System institution qualifies for an exception from the escrow requirement under paragraph (a)(2) or (c) of this section, respectively;

        (ii) The borrower is already escrowing all premiums and fees for flood insurance for the loan; or

        (iii) The System institution is required to escrow flood insurance premiums and fees pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2)  For any loan subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the System institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall mail or deliver to the borrower no later than June 30, 2016, or September 30 of the first calendar year in which the System institution has had a change in status pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a notice in writing, or if the borrower agrees, electronically, informing the borrower of the option to escrow all premiums and fees for any required flood insurance and the method(s) by which the borrower may request the escrow, using language similar to the model clause in appendix B to this subpart.

        (3)  The System institution, or the servicer acting on its behalf, must begin escrowing premiums and fees for flood insurance as soon as reasonably practicable after the System institution, or servicer, receives the borrower's request to escrow.

        § 614.4955   Notice of special flood hazards and availability of Federal disaster relief assistance.

#### § § 614.4955

        (a)  When a System institution makes, increases, extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the System institution shall mail or deliver a written notice to the borrower and to the servicer in all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under the 1968 Act for the collateral securing the loan.

        (d)  The System institution shall retain a record of the receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the period of time it owns the loan.

        (e)  Instead of providing the notice to the borrower required by paragraph (a) of this section, a System institution may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or lessor that, within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale or lease transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to the purchaser or lessee. The System institution shall retain a record of the written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time it owns the loan.

        § 615.5120   Purchase eligibility requirement.

#### § § 615.5120

        (a)  Eligibility to purchase Farm Credit Investment Bonds shall be limited to members and employees of the Farm Credit banks and associations, except any bank officers, directors, and employees who are involved in setting the term or rate, to retired employees who are beneficiaries of a pension or retirement program of the Farm Credit banks or associations, and to retired employees of the Farm Credit Administration. A member of a Farm Credit association or a bank for cooperatives need not be an active borrower to be eligible. A member of any Farm Credit institution may purchase investment bonds from any of the institutions in the district which offer the purchase program. Patrons, members, employees, or stockholder of other financing institutions discounting loans with a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank or of any legal entity which is a borrower from any Farm Credit institution as such are ineligible as they are not members of a Farm Credit institution. Stock or participation certificates shall not be sold merely to qualify a party for the purchase of Farm Credit Investment Bonds. For purposes of this section “member” means a stockholder or participation certificate holder who acquired stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, to purchase stock for investment or to qualify for other services of the association or bank. A person who assumes a loan is not a member unless he becomes a stockholder or participation certificate holder in connection with that loan. Employee means a regular full-time employee of a Farm Credit bank or association. Retired employee means a retiree who is a direct beneficiary of a pension or retirement program of a Farm Credit bank or association or the Farm Credit Administration under civil service retirement.

        (b)  Farm Credit Investment Bonds are registered bonds issued in definitive or book-entry form depending on investor preference. The registration used must express the actual ownership of an interest in the bond and will be considered by the issuing institution as conclusive of such ownership and interest. No designation of an attorney, agent, or other representative to request or receive payment on behalf of the owner or coowner, nor any restriction on the right of the owner or coowner to receive payment of the bond or interest, except as provided in this section may be made in the registration or otherwise. Registrations requested in applications for the purchase shall be clear, accurate, complete, and conform with one of the registration provisions set forth in this section, and include the appropriate taxpayer identifying number. Registrations requested will be inscribed on the face of the bond if in definitive form or on the confirmation of investment if in book-entry form. The following provisions shall apply for registration of Farm Credit Investment Bonds:

        (1) In all cases the member's name (whether a natural person, fiduciary, or legal entity) or employee's name must appear as owner of the bond.

        (2) A bond may be registered in the name of a fiduciary only if the fiduciary is in fact the member.

        (3) A member or employee may not use a form of registration (such as a gift to a minor, irrevocable trust, etc.) which would divest himself of ownership. However, a minor may be named as coowner or beneficiary.

        (4) If a member is a natural person, a second natural person, member or nonmember, may be named as coowner or beneficiary. Coownership may not involve a fiduciary or private organization.

        (5) In the coownership form the connective “or” shall serve the same purpose as “joint tenants with right of survivorship.”

        § 615.5132   Investment purposes.

#### § § 615.5132

        (a) Each Farm Credit bank may hold eligible investments, listed under § 615.5140, in an amount not to exceed 35 percent of its total outstanding loans, to comply with its liquidity requirements in § 615.5134, manage surplus short-term funds, and manage interest rate risk under § 615.5180. To comply with this calculation, the 30-day average daily balance of investments is divided by loans. Investments are calculated at amortized cost. Loans are calculated as defined in § 615.5131. For the purpose of this calculation, loans include accrued interest and do not include any allowance for credit loss adjustments. Compliance with the calculation is measured on the last day of every month.

        (b) The following investments may be excluded when calculating the amount of eligible investments held by the Farm Credit bank pursuant to § 615.5132(a):

        (1) Eligible investments listed under § 615.5140 that are pledged by a Farm Credit bank to meet margin requirements for derivative transactions; and

        (2) Any other investments FCA determines are appropriate for exclusion.

        § 615.5133   Investment management.

#### § § 615.5133

        (a)  The board of directors must adopt written policies for managing the institution's investment activities. The board must also ensure that management complies with these policies and that appropriate internal controls are in place to prevent loss. At least annually, the board, or a designated committee of the board, must review the sufficiency of these investment policies.

        (b)  Investment policies must address the purposes and objectives of investments; risk tolerance; delegations of authority; internal controls; due diligence; and reporting requirements. The investment policies must fully address the extent of pre-purchase analysis that management must perform for various classes of investments. The investment policies must also address the means for reporting, and approvals needed for, exceptions to established policies. A Farm Credit bank's investment policy must address portfolio diversification and obligor limits under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section. Investment policies must be sufficiently detailed, consistent with, and appropriate for the amounts, types, and risk characteristics of its investments.

        (c)  Investment policies must establish risk limits for eligible investments and for the entire investment portfolio. The investment policies must include concentration limits to ensure prudent diversification of credit, market, and, as applicable, liquidity risks in the investment portfolio. Risk limits must be based on all relevant factors, including the institution's objectives, capital position, earnings, and quality and reliability of risk management systems and must take into consideration the interest rate risk management program required by § 615.5180 or § 615.5182, as applicable. Investment policies must identify the types and quantity of investments that the institution will hold to achieve its objectives and control credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk as applicable. Each association or service corporation that holds significant investments and each Farm Credit bank must establish risk limits in its investment policies, as applicable, for the following types of risk:

        (1)  Investment policies must establish:

        (i)  Credit quality standards must be established for single or related obligors, sponsors, secured and unsecured exposures, and asset classes or obligations with similar characteristics.

        (ii)  Concentration limits must be established for single or related obligors, sponsors, geographical areas, industries, unsecured exposures, asset classes or obligations with similar characteristics.

        (iii)  Each institution must buy and sell eligible investments with more than one securities firm. The institution must define its criteria for selecting brokers and dealers used in buying and selling investments.

        (iv)  To the extent the institution engages in repurchase agreements, it must regularly mark the collateral to fair market value and ensure appropriate controls are maintained over collateral held.

        (2)  Investment policies must set market risk limits for specific types of investments and for the investment portfolio.

        (3) —(i)  Investment policies must describe the liquidity characteristics of eligible investments that the bank will hold to meet its liquidity needs and other institutional objectives.

        (ii)  Investment policies must describe the liquid characteristics of eligible investments that the association will hold.

        (4)  Investment policies must address operational risks, including delegations of authority and internal controls under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

        (d)  All delegations of authority to specified personnel or committees must state the extent of management's authority and responsibilities for investments.

        (e)  Each institution must:

        (1) Establish appropriate internal controls to detect and prevent loss, fraud, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized investments.

        (2) Establish and maintain a separation of duties between personnel who supervise or execute investment transactions and personnel who supervise or engage in all other investment-related functions.

        (3) Maintain records and management information systems that are appropriate for the level and complexity of the institution's investment activities.

        (4) Implement an effective internal audit program to review, at least annually, the investment management practices including internal controls, reporting processes, and compliance with FCA regulations. This annual review's scope must be appropriate for the size, risk and complexity of the investment portfolio.

        (f) —(1)  Subject to the exemptions set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, each Farm Credit bank must maintain a well-diversified investment portfolio as set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

        (2)  A well-diversified investment portfolio means that, at a minimum, investments are comprised of different asset classes, maturities, industries, geographic areas, and obligors. These diversification requirements apply to each individual security that the Farm Credit bank holds within a DIF. In addition, except as exempted by paragraph (f)(3) of this section, no more than 15 percent of the investment portfolio may be invested in any one asset class. Securities within each DIF count toward the appropriate asset class. Measurement of this diversification requirement must be based on the portfolio valued at amortized cost.

        (3)  The following investments are not subject to the 15-percent investment portfolio diversification requirement specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section:

        (i) Investments that are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by a U.S. Government agency;

        (ii) Investments that are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by a GSE, except that no more than 50 percent of the investment portfolio may be comprised of GSE MBS. Investments in Farmer Mac securities are governed by § 615.5174 and are not subject to this limitation; and

        (iii) Money market instruments identified in § 615.5131.

        (g)  No more than 10 percent of a Farm Credit bank's total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) as defined by § 628.2 of this chapter may be invested in any one obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to investments in obligations that are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by U.S. Government agencies or fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by GSEs. For a DIF, both the DIF itself and the entities obligated to pay the underlying debt are obligors.

        (h) —(1) —(i)  Before purchasing an investment, the institution must conduct sufficient due diligence to determine whether the investment is eligible under § 615.5140 and complies with its board's investment policies. The institution must document its assessment and retain any supporting information used in that assessment. The institution may hold an investment that does not comply with its investment policies only with the prior approval of its board.

        (ii)  Prior to purchase, the institution must verify the fair market value of the investment (unless it is a new issue) with a source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty or other intermediary to the transaction.

        (iii)  At purchase, the institution must at a minimum include an evaluation of the credit risk (including country risk when applicable), liquidity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and underlying collateral of the investment, as applicable. This assessment must be commensurate with the complexity and type of the investment. The institution must also perform stress testing on any structured investment that has uncertain cash flows, including all MBS and ABS, before purchase. The stress test must be commensurate with the type and complexity of the investment and must enable the institution to determine that the investment does not expose its capital, earnings, or liquidity if applicable, to risks that are greater than those specified in its investment policies. The stress testing must comply with the requirements in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section. The institution must document and retain its risk assessment and stress tests conducted on investments purchased.

        (2)  At least monthly, the institution must determine the fair market value of each investment in its portfolio and the fair market value of its whole investment portfolio.

        (3)  The institution must establish and maintain processes to monitor and evaluate changes in the credit quality of each investment in its portfolio and in its whole investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.

        (4)  (i) The institution must stress test its entire investment portfolio, including stress tests of each investment individually and the whole portfolio, at the end of each quarter. The stress tests must enable the institution to determine that its investment securities, both individually and on a portfolio-wide basis, do not expose its capital, earnings, or liquidity if applicable, to risks that exceed the risk tolerance specified in its investment policies. If the institution's portfolio risk exceeds its investment policy limits, the institution must develop a plan to comply with those limits.

        (ii) The institution's stress tests must be defined in a board-approved policy and must include defined parameters for the security types purchased. The stress tests must be comprehensive and appropriate for the institution's risk profile. At a minimum, the stress tests must be able to measure the price sensitivity of investments over a range of possible interest rates and yield curve scenarios. The stress test methodology must be appropriate for the complexity, structure, and cash flows of the investments in the institution's portfolio. The institution must rely to the maximum extent practicable on verifiable information to support all its stress test assumptions, including prepayment and interest rate volatility assumptions. The institution must document the basis for all assumptions used to evaluate the security and its underlying collateral. The institution must also document all subsequent changes in its assumptions.

        (5)  Before the institution sells an investment, it must verify its fair market value with an independent source not connected with the sale transaction.

        (i)  At least quarterly, the institution's management must report on the following to its board of directors or a designated board committee:

        (1) Plans and strategies for achieving the board's objectives for the investment portfolio;

        (2) Whether the investment portfolio effectively achieves the board's objectives;

        (3) The current composition, quality, and the risk and liquidity profiles of the investment portfolio;

        (4) The performance of each class of investments and the entire investment portfolio, including all gains and losses realized during the quarter on individual investments that the institution sold before maturity and why they were liquidated;

        (5) Potential risk exposure to changes in market interest rates as identified through quarterly stress testing and any other factors that may affect the value of its investment holdings;

        (6) How investments affect its capital, earnings, and overall financial condition;

        (7) Any deviations from the board's policies (must be specifically identified);

        (8) The status and performance of each investment described in § 615.5143(a) and (b) or that does not comply with the institution's investment policies; including the expected effect of these investments on its capital, earnings, liquidity, as applicable, and collateral position; and

        (9) The terms and status of any required divestiture plan or risk reduction plan.

        § 615.5134   Liquidity reserve.

#### § § 615.5134

        (a) —(1)  The board of each Farm Credit bank must adopt a written liquidity policy. The liquidity policy must be compatible with the investment management policies that the bank's board adopts pursuant to § 615.5133 of this part. At least once every year, the bank's board must review its liquidity policy, assess the sufficiency of its liquidity policy, and make any revisions it deems necessary. The board of each Farm Credit bank must ensure that adequate internal controls are in place so that management complies with and carries out this liquidity policy.

        (2)  At a minimum, the liquidity policy of each Farm Credit bank must address:

        (i) The purpose and objectives of the liquidity reserve;

        (ii) Diversification requirements for the liquidity reserve portfolio;

        (iii) The target amount of days of liquidity that the bank needs based on its business model and risk profile;

        (iv) Delegations of authority pertaining to the liquidity reserve; and

        (v) Reporting requirements, which at a minimum must require management to report to the board at least once every quarter about compliance with the bank's liquidity policy and the performance of the liquidity reserve portfolio. However, management must report any deviation from the bank's liquidity policy, or failure to meet the board's liquidity targets to the board before the end of the quarter if such deviation or failure has the potential to cause material loss to the bank.

        (b)  Each Farm Credit bank must maintain at all times a liquidity reserve sufficient to fund at least 90 days of the principal portion of maturing obligations and other borrowings of the bank. At a minimum, each Farm Credit Bank must hold instruments in its liquidity reserve listed and discounted in the Table below that are sufficient to cover:

        (1) Days 1 through 15 only with Level 1 instruments;

        (2) Days 16 through 30 only with Level 1 and Level 2 instruments; and

        (3) Days 31 through 90 with Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 instruments.

        (c)  All investments that a Farm Credit bank holds in its liquidity reserve and supplemental liquidity buffer in accordance with this section must be unencumbered. For the purpose of this section, an investment is unencumbered if it is free of lien, and it is not explicitly or implicitly pledged to secure, collateralize, or enhance the credit of any transaction. Additionally, an unencumbered investment held in the liquidity reserve cannot be used as a hedge against interest rate risk if liquidation of that particular investment would expose the bank to a material risk of loss.

        (d)  All investments that a Farm Credit bank holds in its liquidity reserve in accordance with this section must be readily marketable. For the purposes of this section, an investment is marketable if it:

        (1) Can be easily and quickly converted into cash with little or no loss in value;

        (2) Exhibits low credit and market risks;

        (3) Has ease and certainty of valuation; and

        (4) Except for money market instruments, can be easily bought and sold in active and sizeable markets without significantly affecting prices.

        (e)  Each Farm Credit bank must hold supplemental liquid assets in excess of the 90-day minimum liquidity reserve. The supplemental liquidity buffer must be comprised of cash and qualified eligible investments authorized by § 615.5140 of this part. A Farm Credit bank must be able to liquidate any qualified eligible investment in its supplemental liquidity buffer within the liquidity policy timeframe established in the bank's liquidity policy at no less than 80 percent of its book value. A Farm Credit bank must remove from its supplemental liquidity buffer any investment that has, at any time, a market value that is less than 80 percent of its book value. Each investment in the supplemental liquidity buffer that has a market value of at least 80 percent of its book value, but does not qualify for Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the liquidity reserve, must be discounted to (multiplied by) 90 percent of its market value. The amount of supplemental liquidity that each Farm Credit bank holds, at minimum, must meet the requirements of its board's liquidity policy, provide excess liquidity beyond the days covered by the liquidity reserve, and satisfy the applicable portions of the bank's CFP in accordance with paragraph (f).

        (f)  The board of each Farm Credit bank must adopt a CFP to ensure sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund normal operations under a variety of stress events. Such stress events include, but are not limited to market disruptions, rapid increase in loan demand, unexpected draws on unfunded commitments, difficulties in renewing or replacing funding with desired terms and structures, requirements to pledge collateral with counterparties, and reduced market access. Each Farm Credit bank must maintain an adequate level of unencumbered and marketable assets in its liquidity reserve that can be converted into cash to meet its net liquidity needs for 30 days based on estimated cash inflows and outflows under an acute stress scenario. The board of directors must review and approve the CFP at least once every year and make adjustments to reflect changes in the bank's risk profile and market conditions. The CFP must:

        (1) Be customized to the financial condition and liquidity risk profile of the bank and the board's liquidity risk tolerance policy.

        (2) Identify funding alternatives that the Farm Credit bank can implement whenever access to funding is impeded, which must include, at a minimum, arrangements for pledging collateral to secure funding and possible initiatives to raise additional capital.

        (3) Require periodic stress testing that analyzes the possible effects on the bank's cash inflows and outflows, liquidity position, profitability and solvency under a variety of stress scenarios.

        (4) Establish a process for managing events that imperil the bank's liquidity, and assign appropriate personnel and implement executable action plans that carry out the CFP.

        § 615.5140   Eligible investments.

#### § § 615.5140

        (a) —(1)  A Farm Credit bank may purchase an investment only if it satisfies the following investment eligibility criteria:

        (i) The investment must be purchased and held for one or more investment purposes authorized in § 615.5132.

        (ii) The investment must be one of the following:

        (A) A non-convertible senior debt security;

        (B) A money market instrument with a maturity of 1 year or less;

        (C) A portion of an MBS or ABS that is fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by a U.S. Government agency;

        (D) A portion of an MBS or ABS that is fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by a GSE;

        (E) The senior-most position of an MBS or ABS that a U.S. Government agency does not fully guarantee as to the timely payment of principal and interest or a GSE does not fully and explicitly guarantee as to the timely payment of principal and interest, provided that the MBS satisfies the definition of “mortgage related security” in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41);

        (F) An obligation of an international or multilateral development bank in which the U.S. is a voting member; or

        (G) Shares of a diversified investment fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, if its portfolio consists solely of securities that satisfy paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of this section, or are eligible under § 615.5174. The investment company's risk and return objectives and use of derivatives must be consistent with the Farm Credit bank's investment policies.

        (iii) At least one obligor of the investment must have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitment for the expected life of the investment. If any obligor whose capacity to meet its financial commitment is being relied upon to satisfy this requirement is located outside the U.S., either:

        (A) That obligor's sovereign host country must have the highest or second-highest consensus Country Risk Classification (0 or 1) as published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or be an OECD member that is unrated; or

        (B) The investment must be fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by a U.S. Government agency.

        (iv) The investment must exhibit low credit risk and other risk characteristics consistent with the purpose or purposes for which it is held.

        (v) The investment must be denominated in U.S. dollars.

        (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, System banks may  purchase resecuritizations (except when both principal and interest are fully and explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government or a GSE) without approval under paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b) —(1)  Each Farm Credit System association, with the approval of its funding bank, may purchase and hold investments to manage risks. Each association must identify and evaluate how the investments that it purchases contributes to management of its risks. Only securities that are issued by, or are unconditionally guaranteed or insured as to the timely payment of principal and interest by, the United States Government or its agencies are investments that associations may acquire for risk management purposes under this paragraph (b).

        (2)  In addition to investing in the securities described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each Farm Credit System association may also manage risk by holding those portions of loans that:

        (i) Lenders, which are not Farm Credit System institutions, originate and then sell in the secondary market; and

        (ii) The United States Department of Agriculture fully and unconditionally guarantees or insures as to both principal and interest.

        (3)  Each association that purchases investments pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section must document how its investment activities contribute to managing risks as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such documentation must address and evidence that the association:

        (i) Complies with § 615.5133(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (i). These investment management processes must be appropriate for the size, risk and complexity of the association's investment portfolio.

        (ii) Complies with § 615.5182 for investments that exhibit interest rate risk that could lead to significant declines in net income or in the market value of capital.

        (iii) Assesses how these investments impact the association's overall credit risk profile and how these investment purchases aid in diversifying, hedging, or mitigating overall credit risk.

        (iv) Considers and evaluates any other relevant factors unique to the association or to the nature of the investments that could affect the association's overall risk-bearing capacity, including but not limited to management experience and capability to understand and manage unique risks in investments purchased.

        (4)  The total amount of investments purchased and held under this section must not exceed 10 percent of the association's total outstanding loans. In computing this limit:

        (i) Include in the numerator the daily (point-in-time) balance of all investments purchased and held under this section. Unless otherwise directed by FCA, associations must use the investment balance on the last business day of the quarter when calculating the numerator of the portfolio limit under this paragraph. For this calculation, value investments at amortized cost and accrued interest.

        (ii) Include in the denominator the 90-day average daily balance of total outstanding loans as defined in § 615.5131. For this calculation, value loans at amortized cost and include accrued interest. The denominator does not include any allowance for credit loss adjustments.

        (iii) Exclude from the numerator the following:

        (A) Equity investments in unincorporated business entities authorized in § 611.1150 of this chapter;

        (B) Equity investments in Rural Business Investment Companies organized under 7 U.S.C. 2009cc

        (C) Equity investments in Class B Farmer Mac stock authorized in § 615.5173; and

        (D) Farmer Mac agricultural mortgage-backed securities under § 615.5174.

        (5)  (i) The association must not purchase and hold investments without the funding bank's prior approval. The bank must review the association's prior approval requests and explain in writing its reasons for approving or denying the request. The prior approval is required before the association engages in investment activities and with any significant change(s) in investment strategy.

        (ii) In deciding whether to approve an association's request to purchase and hold investments, the bank must evaluate and document that the association:

        (A) Has adequate policies, procedures, and controls, in place for its investment accounting and reporting;

        (B) Has capable staff with the necessary expertise to manage the risks in investments; and

        (C) Complies with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (iii) The bank must review annually the investment portfolio of every association that it funds. This annual review must evaluate whether the association's investments manage risks over time, and the continued adequacy of the associations' risk management practices.

        (6)  (i) An association is not required to divest of any investment held on January 1, 2019 that was authorized under § 615.5140 as contained in 12 CFR part 615 revised as of January 1, 2018 or otherwise by official written FCA action that allowed the association to continue to hold such investment. Once such investment matures, the association must not renew it unless the investment is authorized pursuant to this section.

        (ii) No association is required to divest of investments if a decline in total outstanding loans causes it to exceed the portfolio limit in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. However, the institution must not purchase new investments unless, after they are purchased, the total amount of investments held falls within the portfolio limit.

        (c)  FCA may, on a case-by-case basis, determine that a particular investment you are holding poses inappropriate risk, notwithstanding that it satisfies the investment eligibility criteria. If so, we will notify you as to the proper treatment of the investment.

        (d) [Reserved]

        (e)  You may purchase and hold investments that we approve. Your request for our approval must explain the risk characteristics of the investment and your purpose and objectives for making the investment.

System institutions must not purchase ineligible investments. If the institution determines that it has purchased an ineligible investment, it must notify FCA within 15 calendar days after the determination. The institution must divest of the investment no later than 60 calendar days after determining that the investment is ineligible unless FCA approves, in writing, a plan that authorizes the institution to divest the investment over a longer period. Until the institution divests of the ineligible investment:

        (1) A Farm Credit bank must not use the ineligible investment to satisfy its liquidity requirement(s) under § 615.5134;

        (2) The institution must include the ineligible investment in the portfolio limit calculation defined in § 615.5132 or § 615.5140(b)(4), as applicable; and

        (3) A Farm Credit bank must exclude the ineligible investment as collateral under § 615.5050.

        (b)  If the institution determines that an investment (that satisfied the eligibility criteria set forth in § 615.5140(a) or (b), as applicable, when purchased) no longer satisfies the criteria, or that an investment that FCA approved pursuant to § 615.5140(e), no longer satisfies the conditions of approval, the institution may continue to hold the investment, subject to the following requirements:

        (1) The institution must notify FCA within 15 calendar days after such determination;

        (2) A Farm Credit bank must not use the ineligible investment to satisfy its liquidity requirement(s) under § 615.5134;

        (3) The institution must include the ineligible investment in the portfolio limit calculation defined in § 615.5132 or § 615.5140(b)(4), as applicable;

        (4) A Farm Credit bank may continue to include the investment as collateral under § 615.5050 at the lower of cost or market value; and

        (5) The institution must develop a plan to reduce the investment's risk to the institution.

        (c)  FCA retains the authority to require the institution to divest of any investment at any time for failure to comply with § 615.5132(a) or § 615.5140(a), (b), or (e), or for safety and soundness reasons. The timeframe set by FCA will consider the expected loss on the transaction (or transactions) and the effect on the institution's financial condition and performance.

#### § § 615.5200

        (a) The Board of Directors of each System institution shall determine the amount of regulatory capital needed to assure the System institution's continued financial viability and to provide for growth necessary to meet the needs of its borrowers. The minimum capital standards specified in this part and part 628 of this chapter are not meant to be adopted as the optimal capital level in the System institution's capital adequacy plan. Rather, the standards are intended to serve as minimum levels of capital that each System institution must maintain to protect against the credit and other general risks inherent in its operations.

        (b) Each Board of Directors shall establish, adopt, and maintain a formal written capital adequacy plan as a part of the financial plan required by § 618.8440 of this chapter. The plan shall include the capital targets that are necessary to achieve the System institution's capital adequacy goals as well as the minimum permanent capital, common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, tier 1 capital, total capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios (including the unallocated retained earnings (URE) and URE equivalents minimum) standards. The plan shall expressly acknowledge the continuing and binding effect of all board resolutions adopted in accordance with § 628.20(b)(1)(xiv), (c)(1)(xiv), and (d)(1)(xi) of this chapter, and with § 628.21 of this chapter. The plan shall address any projected dividend payments, patronage payments, equity retirements, or other action that may decrease the System institution's capital or the components thereof for which minimum amounts are required by this part and part 628 of this chapter. The plan shall set forth the circumstances and minimum timeframes in which equities may be redeemed or revolved consistent with the System institution's applicable bylaws or board of directors' resolutions.

        (c) In addition to factors that must be considered in meeting the minimum standards, the board of directors shall also consider at least the following factors in developing the capital adequacy plan:

        (1) Capability of management and the board of directors (the assessment of which may be a part of the assessments required in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(7)(i) of § 618.8440 of this chapter);

        (2) Quality of operating policies, procedures, and internal controls;

        (3) Quality and quantity of earnings;

        (4) Asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses to absorb potential loss within the loan and lease portfolios;

        (5) Sufficiency of liquid funds;

        (6) Needs of a System institution's customer base; and

        (7) Any other risk-oriented activities, such as funding and interest rate risks, potential obligations under joint and several liability, contingent and off-balance-sheet liabilities or other conditions warranting additional capital.

        (a) The System institution's permanent capital ratio is determined on the basis of the financial statements of the System institution prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

        (b) The System institution's asset base and permanent capital are computed using average daily balances for the most recent 3 months.

        (c) The System institution's permanent capital ratio is calculated by dividing the System institution's permanent capital, adjusted in accordance with § 615.5207 (the numerator), by the risk-adjusted asset base (the denominator) as defined in § 615.5201, to derive a ratio expressed as a percentage.

        § 615.5207   Capital adjustments and associated reductions to assets.

#### § § 615.5207

        For the purpose of computing the System institution's permanent capital ratio, the following adjustments must be made prior to assigning assets to risk-weight categories and computing the ratio:

        (a) Where two System institutions have stock investments in each other, such reciprocal holdings must be eliminated to the extent of the offset. If the investments are equal in amount, each System institution must deduct from its assets and its permanent capital an amount equal to the investment. If the investments are not equal in amount, each System institution must deduct from its permanent capital and its assets an amount equal to the smaller investment. The elimination of reciprocal holdings required by this paragraph must be made prior to making the other adjustments required by this section.

        (b) Where an association has an equity investment in a System bank, the double counting of capital is eliminated in the following manner:

        (1) For a purchased investment, each association must deduct its investment in a System bank from its permanent capital. Each System bank will consider all purchased stock investments as its permanent capital.

        (2) For an allocated investment, each System bank and each of its affiliated associations may enter into an agreement that specifies, for computing permanent capital only, a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the association's allocated investment between the bank and the association. Section 615.5208 provides conditions for allotment agreements or defines allotments in the absence of such agreements.

        (c) A Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and a recipient, other than an affiliated association, of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and the recipient. Such agreement must comply with § 615.5208, except that, in the absence of an agreement, the allocated investment must be allotted 100 percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of the bank that are purchased by a recipient are considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank.

        (d) A bank for cooperatives and a recipient of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and the recipient. Such agreement must comply with § 615.5208, except that, in the absence of an agreement, the allocated investment must be allotted 100 percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of a bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank.

        (e) Where a System institution has an equity investment in another System institution to capitalize a loan participation interest, the investing System institution must deduct from its permanent capital an amount equal to its investment in the participating System institution.

        (f) Each System institution must deduct from permanent capital any equity investment in a service corporation chartered under section 4.25 of the Act or the Funding Corporation chartered under section 4.9 of the Act.

        (g) Each System institution must deduct from its permanent capital an amount equal to all goodwill, whenever acquired.

        (h) Each System institution must deduct from its risk-adjusted asset base any item deducted from permanent capital under this section.

        (i) Where a System bank and an association have an enforceable written agreement to share losses on specifically identified assets on a predetermined quantifiable basis, such assets must be counted in each System institution's risk-adjusted asset base in the same proportion as the System institutions have agreed to share the loss.

        (j) The permanent capital of a System institution must exclude any accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as reported under GAAP.

        (k) For purposes of calculating capital ratios under this part, deferred-tax assets are subject to the conditions, limitations, and restrictions described in § 628.22(a)(3) of this chapter.

        § 615.5208   Allotment of allocated investments.

#### § § 615.5208

        (a) The following conditions apply to agreements that a System bank enters into with an affiliated association pursuant to § 615.5207(b)(2):

        (1) The agreement must be for a term of 1 year or longer.

        (2) The agreement must be entered into on or before its effective date.

        (3) The agreement may be amended according to its terms, but no more frequently than annually except in the event that a party to the agreement is merged or reorganized.

        (4) On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified copy of the agreement, and any amendments thereto, must be sent to the field office of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining the System institution. A copy must also be sent within 30 calendar days of adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations.

        (5) Unless the parties otherwise agree, if the System bank and the association have not entered into a new agreement on or before the expiration of an existing agreement, the existing agreement will automatically be extended for another 12 months, unless either party notifies the Farm Credit Administration in writing of its objection to the extension prior to the expiration of the existing agreement.

        (b) In the absence of an agreement between a System bank and one or more associations, or in the event that an agreement expires and at least one party has timely objected to the continuation of the terms of its agreement, the following formula applies with respect to the allocated investments held by those associations with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing associations), and does not apply to the allocated investments held by those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing associations):

        (1) The allotment formula must be calculated annually.

        (2) The permanent capital ratio of the System bank must be computed as of the date that the existing agreement terminates, using a 3-month average daily balance, excluding the allocated investment from nonagreeing associations but including any allocated investments of agreeing associations that are allotted to the bank under applicable allocation agreements. The permanent capital ratio of each nonagreeing association must be computed as of the same date using a 3-month average daily balance, and must be computed excluding its allocated investment in the bank.

        (3) If the permanent capital ratio of the System bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association whose permanent capital ratio calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section is 7 percent or above must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the association.

        (4) If the permanent capital ratio of the System bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association whose capital ratio is below 7 percent must be allotted to the association until the association's capital ratio reaches 7 percent or until all of the investment is allotted to the association, whichever occurs first. Any remaining unallotted allocated investment must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the association.

        (5) If the permanent capital ratio of the System bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section is less than 7 percent, the amount of additional capital needed by the bank to reach a permanent capital ratio of 7 percent must be determined, and an amount of the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association must be allotted to the System bank, as follows:

        (i) If the total of the allocated investments of all nonagreeing associations is greater than the additional capital needed by the bank, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association must be multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the amount of capital needed by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount must be allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio of any nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of unallotted allocated investment must then be allotted to each nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital ratio to 7 percent, or until all such remaining investment is allotted to the association, whichever occurs first. Any unallotted allocated investment still remaining must be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the nonagreeing association.

        (ii) If the additional capital needed by the bank is greater than the total of the allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations, all of the remaining allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations must be allotted to the bank.

This limitation shall not apply to the payment of noncash patronage refunds by any institution exempt from Federal income tax if the entire refund paid qualifies as permanent capital at the issuing institution. Any System institution subject to Federal income tax may pay patronage refunds partially in cash if the cash portion of the refund is the minimum amount required to qualify the refund as a deductible patronage distribution for Federal income tax purposes and the remaining portion of the refund paid qualifies as permanent capital.

#### § § 615.5220

        (a) The board of directors of each System bank and association shall, pursuant to section 4.3A of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act), adopt capitalization bylaws, subject to the approval of its voting shareholders, that set forth:

        (1) Classes of equities and the manner in which they shall be issued, transferred, converted and retired;

        (2) For each class of equities, a description of the class(es) of persons to whom such stock may be issued, voting rights, dividend rights and preferences, and priority upon liquidation, including rights, if any, to share in the distribution of the residual estate;

        (3) The number of shares and par value of equities authorized to be issued for each class of equities. However, the bylaws need not state a number or value limit for these equities:

        (i) Equities that are required to be purchased as a condition of obtaining a loan, lease, or related service.

        (ii) Non-voting stock resulting from the conversion of voting stock due to repayment of a loan.

        (iii) Non-voting equities that are issued to an association's funding bank in conjunction with any agreement for a transfer of capital between the association and the bank.

        (iv) Equities resulting from the distribution of earnings.

        (4) For Farm Credit Banks, agricultural credit banks (with respect to loans other than to cooperatives), and associations, the percentage or dollar amount of equity investment (which may be expressed as a range within which the board of directors may from time to time determine the requirement) that will be required to be purchased as a condition for obtaining a loan, which amount shall be not less than 2 percent of the loan amount or $1,000, whichever is less;

        (5) For banks for cooperatives and agricultural credit banks (with respect to loans to cooperatives), the percentage or dollar amount of equity or guaranty fund investment (which may be expressed as a range within which the board may from time to time determine the requirement) that serves as a target level of investment in the bank for patronage-sourced business, which amount shall not be less than, 2 percent of the loan amount or $1,000, whichever is less;

        (6) The manner in which equities will be retired, including a provision stating that equities other than those protected under section 4.9A of the Act are retireable at the sole discretion of the board, provided minimum capital adequacy standards established by the Farm Credit Administration, and the capital requirements established by the board of directors of the System institution, are met;

        (7) The manner in which earnings will be allocated and distributed, including the basis on which patronage will be paid, which shall be in accord with cooperative principles; and

        (8) For System banks, the manner in which the capitalization requirements of the Farm Credit bank shall be allocated and equalized from time to time among its owners.

        (b) The board of directors of each service corporation (including the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation) shall adopt capitalization bylaws, subject to the approval of its voting shareholders, that set forth the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to the extent applicable.

        § 615.5230   Implementation of cooperative principles.

#### § § 615.5230

        (a) Voting stockholders of Farm Credit banks and associations shall be accorded full voting rights in accordance with cooperative principles, including those set forth in § 611.350 of this chapter. Except as otherwise required by statute or regulation, and except as modified by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the voting rights of each voting shareholder are as follows:

        (1) Each voting stockholder of a Farm Credit Bank has only one vote that is assigned a weight proportional to the number of that association's voting stockholders and has the right to vote in the election of each stockholder-elected director and to cumulate such votes and distribute them among the candidates in the stockholder's discretion, except that cumulative voting for directors may be eliminated if 75 percent of the associations that are stockholders of the Farm Credit Bank vote in favor of elimination. In a vote to eliminate cumulative voting, each association shall be accorded one vote.

        (2) Each voting stockholder of an agricultural credit bank has only one vote, unless another voting scheme has been approved by the Farm Credit Administration.

        (3) Each voting stockholder of an association or bank for cooperatives has only one vote, regardless of the number of shares owned or the number of loans outstanding. Unless regional election of directors is provided for in the bylaws pursuant to § 615.5230(b), each voting stockholder of an association or bank for cooperatives has the right to vote in the election of each stockholder-elected director. Unless otherwise provided in the capitalization bylaws, each voting stockholder of an association or bank for cooperatives is allowed to cumulate such votes and distribute them among the candidates in the stockholder's discretion. Cumulative voting is not allowed in the regional election of stockholder-elected directors.

        (b) The regional election of stockholder-elected directors is only permitted under the following conditions:

        (1) A bylaw establishing regional elections is approved by a majority of voting stockholders, voting in person or by proxy, prior to implementation.

        (2) The bylaw provides that the use of regional election of stockholder-elected directors does not prevent all voting stockholders of the institution, regardless of the region where they reside or conduct agricultural or aquatic operations, from voting in any stockholder vote to remove a director.

        (3) There are an approximately equal number of voting stockholders in each of the institution's voting regions. Regions will have an approximately equal number of voting stockholders if the number of voting stockholders in any one region does not exceed the number of voting stockholders in any other region by more than 25 percent. At least once every 3 years, the institution must count the number of voting stockholders in each region and, if the regions do not have an approximately equal number of stockholders, the regional boundaries must be adjusted to achieve such result.

        (4) An institution may provide for more than one director to represent a region. Institutions providing for more than one director to represent a region will determine the equitability of the regions by dividing the number of voting stockholders in that region by the number of director positions representing that region, and the resulting quotient shall be the number that is compared to the number of voting stockholders in other regions.

        (5) Each voting stockholder is accorded the right to vote in the election of each stockholder-elected director for his or her region.

        (c) Each equityholder of each institution shall be equitably treated in the operation of the institution.

        (1) Each issuance of preferred stock (other than preferred stock outstanding on October 5, 1988, and stock into which such outstanding stock is converted that has substantially similar preferences) shall be approved by a majority of the shares voting of each class of equities adversely affected by the preference, voting as a class, whether or not such classes are otherwise authorized to vote;

        (2) Any dividends paid to the holders of common stock and participation certificates shall be on a per share basis and without preference as to rate or priority of payment between classes of common stock, between classes of participation certificates, between classes of common stock and classes of participation certificates, or between holders of the same class of stock or participation certificates, except that any class of common stock or participation certificates that result from the conversion of allocated surplus may be subordinated to other classes of common stock and participation certificates in the payment of dividends.

        (3) Any patronage refunds that are paid shall be paid in accordance with cooperative principles, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis determined by the board of directors in accordance with the capitalization bylaws, provided that any earning pools that may be established for the payment of patronage shall be established on a rational and equitable basis that will ensure that each patron of the institution receives its fair share of the earnings of the institution and bears its fair share of the expenses of the institution.

        (4) All classes of common stock and participation certificates (except those resulting from a conversion of allocated surplus) must be accorded the same priority with respect to impairment and restoration of impairment and have the same rights and priority upon liquidation.

        (ii) That the equity is retireable only at the discretion of the board of directors consistent with the institution's bylaws and only if minimum capital standards established under subpart H of this part and part 628 of this chapter are met and that such retirement may also require the approval of the FCA;

        (iii) Whether the institution presently meets its minimum capital standards established under subpart H of this part and part 628 of this chapter;

        (b) An institution may not offer to sell other equities until a disclosure statement is reviewed and cleared by the FCA.

        (c) A disclosure statement must include:

        (1) All of the information required by parts 620 and 628 of this chapter in the annual report to shareholders as of a date within 135 days of the proposed sale. An institution may satisfy this requirement by referring to its most recent annual report to shareholders and the most recent quarterly report filed with the FCA, provided such reports contain the required information;

        (2) The information required by § 615.5250(a)(3) and (4); and

        (3) A discussion of the intended use of the sale proceeds.

        (d) An institution is not required to provide the materials identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section to a purchaser who previously received them unless the purchaser requests it.

        (e) For any class of stock where each purchaser and each subsequent transferee acquires at least $250,000 of the stock and meets the definition of “accredited investor” or “qualified institutional buyer” contained in 17 CFR 230.501 and 230.144A, a disclosure statement submitted pursuant to this section is deemed reviewed and cleared by the FCA and an institution may treat stock that meets all requirements of this part as permanent capital for the purpose of meeting the minimum permanent capital standards established under subpart H of this part, unless the FCA notifies the institution to the contrary within 30 days of receipt of a complete disclosure statement submission. A complete disclosure statement submission includes the proposed disclosure statement plus any additional materials requested by the FCA.

        (f) For all other issuances, a disclosure statement submitted pursuant to this section is deemed cleared by the FCA, and an institution may treat stock that meets all requirements of this part as permanent capital for the purpose of meeting the minimum permanent capital standards established under subpart H unless the FCA notifies the institution to the contrary within 60 days of receipt of a complete disclosure statement submission. A complete disclosure statement submission includes the proposed disclosure statement plus any additional materials requested by the FCA.

        (g) Upon request, the FCA will inform the institution how it will treat the proposed issuance for other regulatory capital ratios or computations.

        (h) No institution, officer, director, employee, or agent shall, in connection with the sale of equities, make any disclosure, through a disclosure statement or otherwise, that is inaccurate or misleading, or omit to make any statement needed to prevent other disclosures from being misleading.

        (i) Each bank and association must establish a method to disclose and make information on insider preferred stock purchases and retirements readily available to the public. At a minimum, each institution offering preferred stock must make this information available upon request.

        (j) The requirements of this section do not apply to the sale of Farm Credit System institution equities to:

        (1) Other Farm Credit System institutions;

        (2) Other financing institutions in connection with a lending or discount relationship; or

        (3) Non-Farm Credit System lenders that purchase equities in connection with a loan participation transaction.

      Subpart L—Establishment of Minimum Capital Ratios for an Individual Institution

**Source:** Source: 62 FR 4448, Jan. 30, 1997, unless otherwise noted.

        § 615.5350   General—Applicability.

#### § § 615.5350

        (a) The rules and procedures specified in this subpart are applicable to a proceeding to establish required minimum capital ratios that would otherwise be applicable to an institution under §§ 615.5205 and 628.10 of this chapter. The Farm Credit Administration is authorized to establish such minimum capital requirements for an institution as the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the institution. Proceedings under this subpart also may be initiated to require an institution having capital ratios greater than those set forth in § 615.5205 or § 628.10 of this chapter to continue to maintain those higher ratios.

        (b) The Farm Credit Administration may require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual institution in view of its circumstances. For example, higher capital ratios may be appropriate for:

        (1) An institution receiving special supervisory attention;

        (2) An institution that has, or is expected to have, losses resulting in capital inadequacy;

        (3) An institution with significant exposure due to operational risk, interest rate risk, the risks from concentrations of credit, certain risks arising from other products, services, or related activities, or management's overall inability to monitor and control financial risks presented by concentrations of credit and related services activities;

        (4) An institution exposed to a high volume of, or particularly severe, problem loans;

        (5) An institution that is growing rapidly; or

        (6) An institution that may be adversely affected by the activities or condition of System institutions with which it has significant business relationships or in which it has significant investments.

        (7) An institution with significant exposures to declines in net income or in the market value of its capital due to a change in interest rates and/or the exercising of embedded or explicit options.

        § 615.5351   Standards for determination of appropriate individual institution minimum capital ratios.

#### § § 615.5351

        The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual institution cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in Agency expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:

        (a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the Farm Credit Administration's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are appropriate or necessary for the institution;

        (b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;

        (c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the institution and, if applicable, affiliated institutions;

        (d) The institution's capital, adverse assets (including nonaccrual and nonperforming loans), allowance for credit loss, and other ratios compared to the ratios of its peers or industry norms; and

        (e) The views of the institution's directors and senior management.

        § 615.5352   Procedures.

#### § § 615.5352

        (a)  When the Farm Credit Administration determines that minimum capital ratios greater than those set forth in § 615.5205 or § 628.10 of this chapter are necessary or appropriate for a particular institution, the Farm Credit Administration will notify the institution in writing of the proposed minimum capital ratios and the date by which they should be reached (if applicable) and will provide an explanation of why the ratios proposed are considered necessary or appropriate for the institution.

        (b)  (1) The institution may respond to any or all of the items in the notice. The response should include any matters which the institution would have the Farm Credit Administration consider in deciding whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the institution, what those capital ratios should be, and, if applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated Farm Credit Administration official within 30 days after the date on which the institution received the notice. In its discretion, the Farm Credit Administration may extend the time period for good cause. The Farm Credit Administration may shorten the time period with the consent of the institution or when, in the opinion of the Farm Credit Administration, the condition of the institution so requires, provided that the institution is informed promptly of the new time period.

        (2) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the Farm Credit Administration shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed minimum capital ratios or the deadline for their achievement.

        (c)  After the close of the institution's response period, the Farm Credit Administration will decide, based on a review of the institution's response and other information concerning the institution, whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the institution and, if so, the ratios and the date the requirements will become effective. The institution will be notified of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision, except for a decision not to establish individual minimum capital requirements for the institution.

        (d)  The decision may require the institution to develop and submit to the Farm Credit Administration, within a time period specified, an acceptable plan to reach the minimum capital ratios established for the institution by the date required.

        (e)  If, after the Farm Credit Administration's decision in paragraph (c) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting the institution's capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required minimum capital ratios by the specified date, either the institution or the Farm Credit Administration may propose a change in the minimum capital ratios for the institution, the date when the minimums must be achieved, or the institution's plan (if applicable). The Farm Credit Administration may decline to consider proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the Farm Credit Administration's original decision and any plan required under that decision shall continue in full force and effect.

        (2) Adhere to a previously submitted plan to achieve the applicable capital ratios;

        (3) Submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit Administration describing the means and time schedule by which the institution shall achieve the applicable capital ratios;

        (5) A combination of any of these or similar actions.

        (b) A capital directive may also be issued to the board of directors of an institution, requiring such board to comply with the requirements of section 4.3A(d) of the Act prohibiting the reduction of permanent capital.

        (c) A capital directive issued under this rule, including a plan submitted under a capital directive, is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order which has become final as defined in section 5.25 of the Act. Violation of a capital directive may result in assessment of civil money penalties in accordance with section 5.32 of the Act.

#### § § 615.5357

The response shall include any information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other relevant evidence that supports its position. The response may include a plan for achieving the minimum capital ratios applicable to the institution. The response must be in writing and delivered to the Farm Credit Administration within 30 days after the date on which the institution received the notice. In its discretion, the Farm Credit Administration may extend the time period for good cause. The Farm Credit Administration may shorten the 30-day time period:

        (1) When, in the opinion of the Farm Credit Administration, the condition of the institution so requires, provided that the institution shall be informed promptly of the new time period;

        (2) With the consent of the institution; or

        (3) When the institution already has advised the Farm Credit Administration that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital ratios.

        (b) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the Farm Credit Administration shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed capital directive.

        § 615.5358   Decision.

#### § § 615.5358

        After the closing date of the institution's response period, or receipt of the institution's response, if earlier, the Farm Credit Administration may seek additional information or clarification of the response. Thereafter, the Farm Credit Administration will determine whether or not to issue a capital directive, and if one is to be issued, whether it should be as originally proposed or in modified form.

#### § § 615.5359

        (a) A capital directive will be served by delivery to the institution. It will include or be accompanied by a statement of reasons for its issuance.

        (b) A capital directive is effective immediately upon its receipt by the institution, or upon such later date as may be specified therein, and shall remain effective and enforceable until it is stayed, modified, or terminated by the Farm Credit Administration.

        § 615.5360   Reconsideration based on change in circumstances.

#### § § 615.5360

        Upon a change in circumstances, an institution may request the Farm Credit Administration to reconsider the terms of its capital directive or may propose changes in the plan to achieve the institution's applicable minimum capital ratios. The Farm Credit Administration also may take such action on its own motion. The Farm Credit Administration may decline to consider requests or proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the capital directive and plan shall continue in full force and effect.

        § 615.5361   Relation to other administrative actions.

#### § § 615.5361

        A capital directive may be issued in addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including cease and desist proceedings, civil money penalties, or the conditioning or denial of applications. The Farm Credit Administration also may, in its discretion, take any action authorized by law, in lieu of a capital directive, in response to an institution's failure to achieve or maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios.

        § 615.5452   Law governing rights and obligations of Federal Reserve Banks, Farm Credit banks, and Funding Corporation; rights of any person against Federal Reserve Banks, Farm Credit banks, and Funding Corporation.

#### § § 615.5452

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following are governed solely by the regulations contained in this subpart O, the securities documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:

        (1) The rights and obligations of the Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:

        (i) A book-entry security or security entitlement, and

        (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Farm Credit securities; and

        (2) The rights of any person, including a participant, against the Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:

        (i) A book-entry security or security entitlement, and

        (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Farm Credit securities.

        (b) A security interest in a security entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 615.5454(c)(1) of this subpart, is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the participant's securities account is located. A security interest in a security entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a person that is not a participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 615.5454(c)(1)of this subpart, is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in § 615.5453 of this subpart.

        (c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted revised Article 8 (see 31 CFR 357.2) then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.

        § 615.5453   Law governing other interests.

#### § § 615.5453

        (a) To the extent not inconsistent with these regulations, the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a securities intermediary's jurisdiction governs:

        (1) The acquisition of a security entitlement from the securities intermediary;

        (2) The rights and duties of the securities intermediary and entitlement holder arising out of a security entitlement;

        (3) Whether the securities intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security entitlement;

        (4) Whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person who acquires a security entitlement from the securities intermediary or a person who purchases a security entitlement or interest therein from an entitlement holder; and

        (5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest in a security entitlement.

        (b) The following rules determine a “securities intermediary's jurisdiction” for purposes of this section:

        (1) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.

        (2) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.

        (3) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the entitlement holder's account.

        (4) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the entitlement holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the securities intermediary.

        (c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.

        (d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted revised Article 8 (see 31 CFR 357.2), then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be the law of that State as though revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the securities account is a clearing corporation, and the participant's interest in a book-entry security is a security entitlement.

        § 615.5454   Creation of participant's security entitlement; security interests.

#### § § 615.5454

        (a) A participant's security entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book entry that a book-entry security has been credited to a participant's securities account.

        (b) A security interest in a security entitlement of a participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a security entitlement of a participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.

        (c)(1) The Farm Credit Banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a security entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, a Farm Credit Bank, the Funding Corporation, or a person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a security entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.

        (2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 615.5452(b) or § 615.5453 of this subpart. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by that applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under that law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of the security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.

#### § § 615.5455

        (a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 615.5454(c)(1), for the purposes of this subpart O, the Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the participant to whose securities account an interest in a book-entry security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a transfer message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. The Federal Reserve Banks, the Farm Credit banks, and the Funding Corporation are not liable to a person asserting or having an adverse claim to a security entitlement or to a book-entry security in a participant's securities account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a book-entry security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a transfer message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.

        (b) The obligation of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation to make payments (including payments of interest and principal) with respect to book-entry securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:

        (1) Interest or other payments on book-entry securities are either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a funds account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the participant.

        (2) Book-entry securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the participant's securities account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest, where applicable, to a funds account at the Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest as directed by the participant. No action by the participant is required in connection with the redemption of a book-entry security.

        (5) To perform such other duties as fiscal agent as may be requested by the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation.

        (b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not inconsistent with this subpart, governing the details of its handling of book-entry securities, security entitlements, and the operation of the Book-entry System under this subpart.

        § 615.5457   Withdrawal of eligible book-entry securities for conversion to definitive form.

#### § § 615.5457

        (a) Eligible book-entry securities may be withdrawn from the Book-entry System by requesting delivery of like definitive Farm Credit securities.

        (b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions to withdraw eligible book-entry securities from book-entry in the Book-entry System, convert such securities into definitive Farm Credit securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions.

        (c) Farm Credit securities which are to be delivered upon withdrawal may be issued in either registered or bearer form, to the extent permitted by the applicable securities documentation.

        (d) All requests for withdrawal of eligible book-entry securities must be made prior to the maturity or the applicable date of call of the Farm Credit securities.

#### § § 615.5458

        The Farm Credit Administration reserves the right, in the Farm Credit Administration's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of the regulations in this subpart in any case or class of cases for the convenience of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation or in order to relieve any person(s) of unnecessary hardship, if such action is not inconsistent with law, does not adversely affect any substantial existing rights, and the Farm Credit Administration is satisfied that such action will not subject the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation to any substantial expense or liability.

#### § § 615.5459

        The Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Banks may rely on the information provided in a transfer message or other transaction documentation, and are not required to verify the information. The Farm Credit banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Banks shall not be liable for any action taken in accordance with the information set out in the transfer message, other transaction documentation, or evidence submitted in support thereof.

        § 615.5460   Additional provisions.

#### § § 615.5460

        (a)  In any case or any class of cases arising under the regulations in this subpart, the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation may require such additional evidence and a bond of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation be necessary for the protection of the interests of the Farm Credit banks and the Funding Corporation.

        (b)  The interest of a debtor in a security entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the securities intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except where a security entitlement is maintained in the name of a secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by legal process upon the secured party. These regulations do not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.

        (c)  Definitive Farm Credit securities may be converted to book-entry form in accordance with the terms of the applicable securities documentation and Federal Reserve Operating Circular.

#### § § 616.600

      For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

      (a)  means ownership interests in any aspect of a lease transaction, including, but not limited to, servicing rights.

      (b)  means any contractual obligation to own and lease, or lease with the option to purchase, equipment or facilities used in the operations of persons eligible to borrow under part 613 of this chapter.

      (c)  means a sale of a lease or an interest in a lease in which the seller:

      (1) Retains some risk of loss from the transferred asset for any cause except the seller's breach of usual and customary warranties or representations designed to protect the purchaser against fraud or misrepresentation; or

      (2) Has an obligation to make payments to any party resulting from:

      (i) Default on the lease by the lessee or guarantor or any other deficiencies in the lessee's performance;

      (ii) Changes in the market value of the assets after transfer;

      (iii) Any contractual relationship between the seller and purchaser incident to the transfer that, by its terms, could continue even after final payment, default, or other termination of the assets transferred; or

      (iv) Any other cause, except that the retention of servicing rights alone shall not constitute recourse.

      § 616.6100   Purchase and sale of interests in leases.

#### § § 616.6100

      (a)  A Farm Credit System institution may buy leases and interests in leases.

      (b)  Each Farm Credit System institution that sells or buys interests in leases must do so only under a policy adopted by its board of directors that addresses the following:

      (1) The types of leases in which the institution may buy or sell an interest and the types of interests which may be bought or sold;

      (2) The underwriting standards for the purchase of interests in leases;

      (3) Such limits on the aggregate lease payments and residual amount of interests in leases that the institution may buy from a single institution as are necessary to diversify risk, and such limits on the aggregate amounts the institution may buy from all institutions as are necessary to assure that service to the territory is not impeded;

      (4) Identification and reporting of leases in which interests are sold or bought;

      (5) Requirements for securing from the selling lessor in a timely manner adequate financial and other information about the lessee needed to make an independent judgment; and

      (6) Any limits or conditions to which sales or purchases are subject that the board considers appropriate, including arbitration.

      (c)  Each agreement to buy or sell an interest in a lease must, at a minimum:

      (1) Identify the particular lease(s) to be covered by the agreement;

      (2) Provide for the transfer of lessee information on a timely and continuing basis;

      (3) Identify the nature of the interest(s) sold or bought;

      (4) Specify the rights and obligations of the parties and the terms and conditions of the sale;

      (5) Contain any terms necessary for the appropriate administration of the lease, including lease servicing and monitoring of the servicer and authorization and conditions for action in the event of lessee distress or default;

      (6) Provide for a method of resolution of disagreements arising under the agreement;

      (7) Specify whether the contract is assignable by either party; and

      (8) In the case of lease transactions through agents, comply with § 614.4325(h) of this chapter, reading the term “lease” or “leases” in place of the term “loan” or “loans,” as applicable.

      (d)  Each institution that buys an interest in a lease must make a judgment on the payment ability of the lessee that is independent of the originating or lead lessor and any intermediary seller or broker. This must occur before the purchase of the interest and before any servicing action that alters the terms of the original agreement. The institution must not delegate such judgment to any person(s) not employed by the institution. A Farm Credit System institution that buys a lease or any interest in a lease may use information, such as appraisals or inspections, provided by the originating or lead lessor, or any intermediary seller or broker; however, the buying Farm Credit System institution must independently evaluate such information when exercising its judgment. The independent judgment must be documented by a payment analysis that considers factors set forth in § 616.6300. The payment analysis must consider such financial and other lessee information as would be required by a prudent lessor and must include an evaluation of the capacity and reliability of the servicer. Boards of directors of jointly managed institutions must adopt procedures to ensure the interests of their respective shareholders are protected in participation between such institutions.

      (e)  When a lease or interest in a lease is sold with recourse:

      (1) For the purpose of determining the lending and leasing limit in subpart J of part 614 of this chapter, the lease must be considered, to the extent of the recourse or guaranty, a lease by the buyer to the seller, and in addition, the seller must aggregate the lease with other obligations of the lessee; and

      (2) The lease subject to the recourse agreement must be considered an asset sold with recourse for the purpose of computing capital ratios.

      (f)  The provisions of § 613.3300 of this chapter that apply to interests in loans made to similar entities apply to interests in leases made to similar entities. In applying these provisions, the term “loan” shall be read to include the term “lease” and the term “principal amount” shall be read to include the term “lease amount.”

      § 616.6200   Out-of-territory leasing.

#### § § 616.6200

      A System institution may make leases outside its chartered territory.

      § 616.6300   Leasing policies, procedures, and underwriting standards.

#### § § 616.6300

      The board of each institution engaged in lease underwriting must adopt a written policy (or policies). Management, at the direction of the board, must develop procedures that reflect lease practices that control risk and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Any leasing activity must comply with the lending policies and loan underwriting requirements in § 614.4150 of this chapter. An institution engaged in the making, buying, or syndicating of leases also must adopt written policies and procedures that address the additional risks associated with leasing. Written policies and procedures must address the following, if applicable:

      (a) Appropriateness of the lease amount, purpose, and terms and conditions, including the residual value established at the inception of the lease;

      (b) Process for estimating the leased asset's market value during the lease term;

      (c) Types of equipment and facilities the institution will lease;

      (d) Remarketing of leased property and associated risks;

        § 617.7005   When may electronic communications be used in the borrower rights process?

#### § § 617.7005

        Qualified lenders may use, with the parties' agreement, electronic commerce (E-commerce), including electronic communications for borrower rights disclosures. Part 609 of this chapter addresses when a qualified lender may use E-commerce. Consistent with these rules, a qualified lender should interpret part 617 broadly to allow electronic transmissions, communications, records, and submissions. However, electronic communications may not be used for a notice of default, acceleration, repossession, foreclosure, eviction, or the right to cure when a borrower's primary residence secures the loan. In these instances, a qualified lender must use paper disclosures.

        § 617.7010   May borrower rights be waived?

#### § § 617.7010

        (a) A qualified lender may not obtain a waiver of borrower rights, except as indicated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b) A borrower may waive rights relating to distressed loan restructuring, credit reviews, and the right of first refusal when a loan is guaranteed by the Small Business Administration or in connection with a loan sale as provided in § 617.7015. Waivers obtained pursuant to this paragraph must be voluntary and in writing. The document evidencing the waiver must clearly explain the rights the borrower is being asked to waive.

        (c) A borrower may waive all borrower rights provided for in part 617 of these regulations in connection with a loan syndication transaction with non-System lenders that are otherwise not required by section 4.14A(a)(6) of the Act to provide borrower rights. For purposes of this paragraph, a “loan syndication” is a multi-lender transaction in which each member of the lending syndicate has a direct contractual relationship with the borrower, but does not include a transaction created for the primary purpose of avoiding borrower rights. Waivers obtained pursuant to this paragraph must be voluntary and in writing. The document evidencing the waiver must clearly disclose the rights the borrower is waiving. Additionally, the borrower's written waiver must contain a statement that the borrower was represented by legal counsel in connection with execution of the waiver.

        § 617.7015   What happens to borrower rights when a loan is sold?

#### § § 617.7015

        (a)  A loan made by a qualified lender and subsequently sold, in whole or in part, to another qualified lender is subject to the borrower rights provisions of title IV of the Act.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the borrower rights provisions of sections 4.14, 4.14A, 4.14B, 4.14C, 4.14D, and 4.36 of the Act do not apply to a loan made on or after February 10, 1996, and designated for sale into a secondary market at the time the loan was made.

        (2) Borrower rights apply to a loan designated for sale under paragraph (b)(1) of this section but not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of designation. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will subsequently apply on the date of sale if the loan is later sold into a secondary market.

        (c)  (1) Except for loans sold to another qualified lender or designated for sale into a secondary market, a qualified lender must comply with one of the following requirements before selling a loan or interest in a loan subject to borrower rights:

        (i) The qualified lender and borrower must agree to include provisions in the loan contract with the borrower, or a written modification thereto, that ensure that the buyer of the loan will be obligated to provide the borrower the same rights a qualified lender must provide; or

        (ii) The qualified lender must obtain from the borrower a signed written consent to the sale, which clearly states the borrower waives statutory borrower rights.

        (2) Before the qualified lender obtains the borrower's consent to the sale of the loan and the waiver of borrower rights under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the qualified lender must disclose in writing to the borrower:

        (i) A complete description of the statutory rights the borrower will waive;

        (ii) Any changes in the loan terms or conditions that will occur if the qualified lender does not sell the loan;

        (iii) That waiving borrower rights will not become effective unless the qualified lender sells the loan; and

        (iv) That borrower rights will become effective again if any qualified lender repurchases the loan or any interest in the loan.

        (3) The consent to the loan sale and waiver of borrower rights shall have no effect until the qualified lender sells the loan. Borrower rights become effective again if any qualified lender repurchases the loan or any interest in the loan.

        (4) A qualified lender may not make a loan conditioned on the borrower consenting to the loan's sale and a waiver of borrower rights.

        § 617.7110   How should a qualified lender disclose the cost of borrower stock or participation certificates?

#### § § 617.7110

        The cost of borrower stock or participation certificates must be included in the effective interest rate calculation at the time the stock or participation certificate is purchased in connection with a loan transaction.

        § 617.7115   How should a qualified lender disclose loan origination charges?

#### § § 617.7115

        Any one-time charge paid by a borrower to a qualified lender in consideration for making a loan must be included in the effective interest rate as a loan origination charge. These include, but are not limited to, loan origination fees, application fees, and conversion fees. Loan origination charges also include any payments made by a borrower to a qualified lender to reduce the interest rate that would otherwise be charged, including any charges designated as “points.”

        (2) The cost of stock or participation certificates that a borrower is required to purchase in connection with the loan; and

        § 617.7300   When acting on a loan application, what are the notice requirements and review rights?

        (d)  As part of a CRC review, an applicant may request an independent collateral evaluation of the agricultural real estate securing the loan or being offered as security, regardless of whether collateral was an identified reason for the adverse credit decision. The independent collateral evaluation may be for any interest(s) in the property securing the loan, except stock or participation certificates issued by the qualified lender and held by the applicant or borrower.

        (1)  The independent collateral evaluation must be conducted by an independent evaluator. The CRC must provide the applicant or borrower with a list of three independent evaluators approved by the qualified lender within 30 days of the request for an independent collateral evaluation. The applicant or borrower must select and engage the services of an evaluator from the list.

#### § § 617.7400

        (b) A qualified lender may not require a borrower to reduce the outstanding principal balance of a loan by any amount that exceeds the regularly scheduled principal installment when due and payable, unless:

        (1) The borrower sells or otherwise disposes of part, or all, of the collateral without the prior approval of the qualified lender and the proceeds from the sale or disposition are not applied to the loan; or

        (2) The parties agree otherwise in writing.

        (c) After a borrower has made all accrued payments of principal, interest, and penalties on a loan, the qualified lender may not enforce acceleration of the borrower's repayment schedule due to the borrower's untimely payment of those principal, interest, or penalty payments.

        (d) If a qualified lender places a loan in non-interest-earning status and this results in an adverse action being taken against the borrower, such as revoking any undisbursed loan commitment, the lender must document the change of status and promptly notify the borrower in writing of the action and the reasons for taking it. If the borrower was not delinquent on any principal, interest, or penalty payment at the time of such action and the borrower's request to have the loan placed back into accrual status is denied, the borrower may obtain a review of the denial before the CRC pursuant to § 617.7310 of this part. The borrower must request this review within 30 days after receiving the lender's notice.

        § 617.7405   On what policies are loan restructurings based?

#### § § 617.7405

        (1) A notice stating that the loan has been identified as distressed and that the borrower has the right to request a restructuring of the loan (nonforeclosure notice).

        (2) A notice that the loan has been identified as distressed, that the borrower has the right to request a restructuring of the loan, and that the alternative to restructuring may be foreclosure (45-day notice). The qualified lender must provide this notice to the borrower no later than 45 days before the qualified lender begins foreclosure proceedings with respect to any loan outstanding to the borrower. This notice must specifically state that if the loan is restructured and the borrower does not perform under the restructure agreement (as described in § 617.7410(e)), the qualified lender may initiate foreclosure proceedings without further notice.

        (b)  (1) A copy of the policy the qualified lender established governing the treatment of distressed loans; and

        (2) All materials necessary for the borrower to submit an application for restructuring.

        (c)  The qualified lender should send a notice that identifies the loan as distressed and the statutory right to file an application for a restructuring. The notice may also restate the language from the automatic stay provision to emphasize that the notice is not intended as an attempt to collect, assess, or recover a claim.

        (d)  The qualified lender is required to notify all primary obligors. If the obligors identify one party to receive notices, the qualified lender should send the original notice to that person and send copies to the other obligors. For borrowers in a bankruptcy proceeding, the qualified lender should send the notice to the borrower and, if retained, the borrower's counsel.

        (e)  A qualified lender must notify a borrower of the right to file another application to restructure the loan if the qualified lender sent the nonforeclosure notice to the borrower and the borrower has performed on the previous restructure agreement. Performance means that a borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments, four consecutive quarterly payments, three consecutive semiannual payments, or two consecutive annual payments. However, a qualified lender is not required to send another notice if they previously sent a 45-day notice, as described in § 617.7410(a)(2), and a borrower did not perform under a restructure agreement, as described above.

        (f)  The qualified lender must provide any borrower to whom a notice has been sent with a reasonable opportunity to meet personally with a representative of the lender. The borrower and lender may meet to review the status of the loan, the financial condition of the borrower, and the suitability of the loan for restructuring. A meeting to discuss a loan that is in a non-interest-earning status may also involve developing a plan for restructuring, if the qualified lender determines the loan is suitable for restructuring.

        (g)  A qualified lender may, in the absence of an application for restructuring from a borrower, propose restructuring to an individual borrower.

        § 617.7415   How does a qualified lender decide to restructure a loan?

#### § § 617.7415

        (a)  The qualified lender should consider the following:

        (1) Whether the cost to the lender of restructuring the loan is equal to or less than the cost of foreclosure, considering all relevant criteria. These criteria include:

        (i) The present value of interest and principal foregone by the lender in carrying out the application for restructuring;

        (ii) Reasonable and necessary administrative expenses involved in working with the borrower to finalize and implement the application for restructuring;

        (iii) Whether the borrower's application for restructuring included a preliminary restructuring plan and cash flow analysis, taking into account income from all sources to be applied to the debt and all assets to be pledged, that show a reasonable probability that orderly debt retirement will occur as a result of the proposed restructuring; and

        (iv) Whether the borrower has furnished, or is willing to furnish, complete and current financial statements in a form acceptable to the qualified lender.

        (2) Whether the borrower is applying all income over and above necessary and reasonable living and operating expenses to the payment of primary obligations;

        (3) Whether the borrower has the financial capacity and the management skills to protect the collateral from diversion, dissipation, or deterioration;

        (4) Whether the borrower is capable of working out existing financial difficulties, taking into consideration any prior restructuring of the loan, reestablishing a viable operation, and repaying the loan on a rescheduled basis; and

        (5) In the case of a distressed loan that is not delinquent, whether restructuring consistent with sound lending practices may be taken to reasonably ensure that the loan will not have to be placed into non-interest-earning status in the future.

        (b)  (1) The difference between the outstanding balance due, as provided by the loan documents, and the liquidation value of the loan, taking into consideration the borrower's repayment capacity and the liquidation value of the collateral used to secure the loan;

        (2) The estimated cost of maintaining a loan classified as a high-risk asset;

        (3) The estimated cost of administrative and legal actions necessary to foreclose a loan and dispose of property acquired as the result of the foreclosure, including attorneys' fees and court costs;

        (4) The estimated cost of value changes in collateral used to secure a loan during the period beginning on the date of the initiation of an action to foreclose or liquidate the loan and ending on the date of the disposition of the collateral; and

        (5) All other costs incurred as the result of the foreclosure or liquidation of a loan.

        (c)  If the borrower and lender are not able to agree on supportable or realistic financial projections, the lender may use benchmarks to determine the operational input costs and chattel security values. These benchmarks may include, but are not limited to, the borrower's 5-year production average; averages in the county where the farming operation is located, based on data from United States Department of Agriculture, local colleges or universities, or other recognized authority; and other such reasonable sources.

        (d)  If a qualified lender determines the potential cost to the lender of restructuring the loan as proposed in the application for restructuring is less than or equal to the potential cost of foreclosure, the qualified lender must restructure the loan. If two or more restructuring alternatives are available, the qualified lender must restructure the loan using the alternative that results in the least cost to the lender.

        (e)  In the event that an application for restructuring is denied, a qualified lender must maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, as applicable.

        § 617.7420   How will a decision on an application for restructuring be issued?

#### § § 617.7420

        (a)  Each qualified lender must provide a written decision on an application for restructuring and provide this decision to the borrower within 15 days from the conclusion of the negotiations used to develop the application for restructuring.

        (b)  On reaching a decision on an application for restructuring, the qualified lender must provide written notice in any manner that requires a primary obligor to acknowledge receipt of the lender's decision. In the case of a loan involving one or more primary obligors, the original notice may be provided to the primary obligor identified to receive such notice, with copies provided by regular mail to the other obligors.

        (c)  When an application for restructuring is denied, the notice must include:

        (1) The specific reason(s) for the denial and any critical assumptions and relevant information on which the specific reasons are based, except that any confidential information shall not be disclosed;

        (2) A statement that the borrower may request a review of the denial;

        (3) A statement that any request for review must be made in writing within 7 days after receiving such notice.

        (4) A brief explanation of the process for seeking review of the denial, including the appraisal review process and the right to appear before the CRC, pursuant to § 617.7310 of this part, accompanied by counsel or any other representative, if the borrower chooses.

        § 617.7425   What type of notice should be given to a borrower before foreclosure?

#### § § 617.7425

        The qualified lender must send the 45-day notice, as described in § 617.7410(a)(2), no later than 45 days before any qualified lender begins foreclosure proceedings. The notice informs the borrower in writing that the loan may be suitable for restructuring and that the qualified lender will review any suitable loan for possible restructuring. The 45-day notice must include a copy of the policy and the materials described in § 617.7410(b). The notice must also state that if the loan is restructured, the borrower must perform under this restructure agreement. If the borrower does not perform, the qualified lender may initiate foreclosure.

        (a)  The notice must inform the borrower that the alternative to restructuring may be foreclosure. If the notice does not inform the borrower of potential foreclosure, then the qualified lender must send a second notice at least 45 days before foreclosure is initiated.

        (b)  A qualified lender must restate the language from the automatic stay provision to emphasize that the notice is not intended to be an attempt to collect, assess, or recover a claim. The qualified lender should send the notice to the borrower and, if retained, the borrower's counsel.

        (c)  No qualified lender may foreclose or continue any foreclosure proceeding with respect to a distressed loan before the lender has completed consideration of any pending application for restructuring and CRC consideration, if applicable. This section does not prevent a lender from taking any action necessary to avoid the dissipation of assets or the diversion, dissipation, or deterioration of collateral if the lender has reasonable grounds to believe that such diversion, dissipation, or deterioration may occur.

        § 617.7430   Are institutions required to participate in state agricultural loan mediation programs?

#### § § 617.7430

        (a) If initiated by a borrower, System institutions must participate in state mediation programs certified under section 501 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and present and explore debt restructuring proposals advanced in the course of such mediation. If provided in the certified program, System institutions may initiate mediation at any time.

        (b) System institutions must cooperate in good faith with requests for information or analysis of information made in the course of mediation under any loan mediation program.

        (c) No System institution may make a loan secured by a mortgage or lien on agricultural property to a borrower on the condition that the borrower waive any right under the agricultural loan mediation program of any state.

        (d) A state mediation may proceed at the same time as the loan restructuring process of § 617.7415 or at any other appropriate time.

      Subpart F—Distressed Loan Restructuring Directive

        § 617.7500   What is a directive used for and what may it require?

#### § § 617.7500

        (a) A distressed loan restructuring directive is an order issued to a qualified lender when FCA has determined that the lender has violated section 4.14A of the Act.

        (b) A distressed loan restructuring directive requires the qualified lender to comply with the specific distressed loan restructuring requirements in the Act.

        (c) A distressed loan restructuring directive is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order that has become final. Any violation of a distressed loan restructuring directive may result in FCA assessing civil money penalties or seeking a court order pursuant to section 5.31 or 5.32 of the Act.

        § 617.7505   How will the qualified lender know when FCA is considering issuing a distressed loan restructuring directive?

#### § § 617.7505

        When FCA intends to issue a distressed loan restructuring directive, it will notify the qualified lender in writing. The notice will state:

        (a) The reasons FCA intends to issue a distressed loan restructuring directive;

        (b) The proposed contents of the distressed loan restructuring directive; and

        (c) Any other relevant information.

        § 617.7510   What should the qualified lender do when it receives notice of a distressed loan restructuring directive?

#### § § 617.7510

        (a) A qualified lender should respond to the notice by stating why FCA should not issue a distressed loan restructuring directive, by proposing changes to the directive, or by seeking other suitable relief. The response must include any information, documentation, or other relevant evidence that supports the qualified lender's position. The response may include a plan for achieving compliance with the distressed loan restructuring requirements of the Act. The response must be in writing and delivered to FCA within 30 days after the date on which the qualified lender received the notice. In its discretion, FCA may extend the time period for good cause. FCA may shorten the 30-day period with the consent of the qualified lender or when FCA determines that providing the full 30 days would result in a borrower not receiving distressed loan restructuring rights.

        (b) If the qualified lender fails to respond within 30 days or such other time period specified by FCA, this failure will constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed distressed loan restructuring directive.

        § 617.7515   How does the FCA decide whether to issue a directive?

#### § § 617.7515

        After the closing date of the qualified lender's response period, or following receipt of the qualified lender's response, FCA must decide if there is sufficient information to support the issuance of a directive or if additional information is necessary. Once FCA has received sufficient information, it must decide whether to issue a directive as originally proposed or as modified.

        § 617.7520   How does the FCA issue a directive and when will it be effective?

#### § § 617.7520

        A distressed loan restructuring directive is effective immediately on receipt by the qualified lender, or on such later date as may be specified by FCA, and will remain effective and enforceable until it is stayed, modified, or terminated by FCA.

        § 617.7525   May FCA use other enforcement actions?

#### § § 617.7525

        FCA may issue a distressed loan restructuring directive in addition to, or instead of, any other action allowed by law, including cease and desist proceedings, civil money penalties, or the granting or conditioning of any application or other requests by the System institution.

The FCA will evaluate the proposed service based on the information submitted, and may also consider whether there are extenuating circumstances or other compelling reasons that justify the proposed service or support a determination that the service is not authorized. This evaluation will focus primarily on Systemwide issues rather than on institution or program-specific factors.

        (2) When authorizing a proposed related service, at its discretion, the FCA may impose special conditions or limitations on any related service or program to offer a related service.

        (3) At its discretion the FCA may, at any time during its evaluation of a proposed related service, publish the proposed related service in the  for public comment.

If a service is not authorized, the reasons for denial will be included in the notifications to the System and the requesting institution.

        (c)  (1) For related services that have been authorized by the FCA, any System bank or association may develop a program and subsequently offer the related service to eligible recipients, subject to any special conditions or institutional limits placed by the FCA. These programs will be subject to review and evaluation during the examination and enforcement process.

        (2) The FCA shall make available to all System banks and associations a list of such related services (“related services list” or “list”) and will update the list in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The list will contain the following:

        (i) A description of each related service; and

        (ii) The types of institutions authorized to offer each type of related service;

        (iii) Identification of any special conditions on how the related service may be offered. The special conditions and description of the service will be fully detailed in FCA's notice to System institutions under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (3) At least 10 business days prior to implementing a related service program already on the list, the System bank or association must notify the FCA Office of Examination field office responsible for examining that institution in writing and provide it with a description of the proposed related service program.

        (c) All fees for related services must be separately identified from loan interest charges and disclosed to the recipient of the service prior to providing or implementing the service.

        § 618.8020   Feasibility requirements.

#### § § 618.8020

        For every related service program a System bank or association provides, it must document program feasibility. The feasibility analysis shall include the following:

        § 618.8030   Out-of-territory related services.

#### § § 618.8030

        (a) System banks and associations may offer related services outside their chartered territories subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The System bank or association obtains consent from all chartered institutions currently offering the same type of service in the territory in which the service is to be provided; or

        (2) If no System bank or association is currently offering the same type of service in the territory, then the out-of-territory institution must obtain the consent of at least one direct lender institution chartered in the territory in which the related service is to be provided.

        (3) The consent obtained pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be in the form of a written agreement with specific terms and conditions including timeframes.

        (b) System banks and associations providing out-of-territory services must fulfill all requirements of subparts A and B of this part 618.

        (c) An institution that consents to another bank or association providing a related service in its chartered territory must meet the requirements of this section, but need not comply with the other requirements of subparts A and B of this part 618, unless the program consented to imposes a financial obligation on the consenting institution. If a financial obligation exists, then the consenting institution must comply with §§ 618.8015, 618.8020 and 618.8025.

        (d) Service corporations must follow the requirements of this section in offering related services out-of-territory. A service corporation cannot consent to an out-of-territory institution providing services in its chartered territory.

      Subpart B—Member Insurance

        § 618.8040   Authorized insurance services.

#### § § 618.8040

        (a) Farm Credit System banks (excluding banks for cooperatives) (hereinafter banks) and associations may sell to their members and borrowers, on an optional basis, credit or term life and credit disability insurance appropriate to protect the loan commitment in the event of death or disability of the debtors. The sale of other insurance necessary to protect a member's or borrower's farm or aquatic unit is permitted, but limited to hail and multiple-peril crop insurance, title insurance, and insurance necessary to protect the facilities and equipment of aquatic members and borrowers. A member or borrower shall have the option, without coercion from the bank or association, to accept or reject such insurance.

        (b) Bank and association board policies governing the provision of member insurance programs shall be established within the following general guidelines:

        (1) A System bank or association may provide credit or term-life or credit-disability insurance only to persons who have a loan or lease with any System bank or association, without regard to whether such institution is the provider. Term-life insurance coverage may continue after the loan has been repaid or the lease terminated, provided the member can reasonably be expected to borrow again within 2 years, and provided the continuation of insurance is not contrary to state law.

        (2) A debtor-creditor relationship is not required for the sale of other insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as purchasers are members of a System bank or association. For the purposes of this section, “member” means someone eligible to borrow who is a stockholder or participation certificate holder and who acquired stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for investment purposes, or to qualify for other services of the association or bank.

        (3) In making insurance available through private insurers, each bank shall approve the programs of more than two insurers for each type of insurance offered in the bank's chartered territory, provided that more than two insurers for each type of insurance have proposed programs to the bank that will, in all likelihood, have long-term viability, and meet the requirements of § 618.8040(b)(4)(i) of this section. The banks shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to attract more than two qualified insurers for each insurance program offered to borrowers in all States of the bank's chartered territory. Where the bank is unable to approve more than two insurers, the bank shall document its efforts to attract additional qualified insurers for the affected insurance program and State. The banks may provide comparative information relating to costs and quality of approved programs and the financial condition of approved companies.

        (4) Member insurance services may be offered only if:

        (i) The insurance program has been approved by the bank or association from among eligible programs made available to it by insurers—

        (A) Meeting reasonable financial and quality of service standards prescribed by the bank; and

        (B) Licensed under State law to do business in the State(s) in which the insurance is offered:

        (ii) The bank or association has the capacity to render authorized insurance services in an effective and efficient manner;

        (iii) There exists the probability that the service will generate sufficient revenue to cover all costs;

        (iv) Rendering the insurance service will not have an adverse effect on the credit or other operations of the bank or association; and

        (v) In making insurance available through approved insurers, the board of directors of the bank or association shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to select and offer at least two approved insurers for each type of insurance made available to the members and borrowers. In the event that the bank or association has selected less than two insurers for any insurance program, such bank or association shall document the reasons why it is unable to offer members and borrowers additional insurers for the affected insurance program.

        (5) All costs to members and borrowers for insurance services provided shall be disclosed separately from interest charges.

        (6) Bank and association personnel shall not benefit from insurance sales by receipt of commissions or gifts from underwriting insurance companies. However, employees may participate in an incentive plan under which incentive compensation is provided based on the sale of insurance.

        (i) In any single year, for all employees except full-time insurance personnel or full-time supervisors or managers of insurance departments, incentive compensation attributable to sales of all types of insurance cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the recipient's annual base salary.

        (ii) In any single year, for full-time insurance personnel and full-time supervisors and managers of insurance departments, incentive compensation for sales of credit life and similar types of insurance (i.e. insurance that pays on a loan or mortgage upon the death or disability of the debtor) cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the recipient's annual base salary.

        (iii) No incentive compensation limit applies to sales of other insurance (crop, title, etc.) by full-time insurance personnel or full-time supervisors or managers of insurance departments.

        (7) Term insurance may be written for the amount of coverage desired by the member or borrower, but in no case may the amount of term insurance, credit life insurance, or a combination of the two with an institution of the System, be in excess of total loan commitments to the member or borrower by the institution writing the insurance.

        (8) The banks may, only by agreement with an insurer, offer services traditionally furnished by insurers to the Farm Credit System. This shall include master marketers when considering the sale of Federal crop insurance. The banks shall not underwrite insurance, adjust claim payments or settlements, or train and school or service adjustors or insurance agents.

        (9) No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly, condition the extension of credit or provision of other service on the purchase of insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association. At the time insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association is offered to a member or borrower, a bank or association shall present a written notice that the service is optional. The notice shall be in prominent type and separately signed by the member or borrower. The bank or association shall explain to the member or borrower that purchase of insurance from the association is optional and that the member or borrower will not be discriminated against for obtaining the insurance elsewhere.

        (10) No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly, discriminate in any manner against any agent, broker, or insurer that is not affiliated with such bank or association, or against any party who purchases insurance through any such nonaffiliated insurance agent, broker, or insurer.

        (11) Bank supervision shall ensure that insurance services offered by approved insurers consistently provide members or borrowers with a high quality and cost-effective service as prescribed by policies of the bank's board of directors, but such supervision shall be without any coercion or suasion from any bank in favor of any agent or insurer.

        (12) Records must be maintained by banks and associations in sufficient detail to facilitate the review and supervision required herein.

L. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1354. Lists of borrowers or stockholders shall not otherwise be released by any bank or association except in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)(1) Within 7 days after receipt of a written request by a stockholder, each Farm Credit bank or association must provide a current list of its stockholders' names, addresses, and classes of stock held to such requesting stockholder. As a condition to providing the list, the bank or association may only require that the stockholder agree and certify in writing that the stockholder will:

        (i) Utilize the list exclusively for communicating with stockholders for permissible purposes; and

        (ii) Not make the list available to any person, other than the stockholder's attorney or accountant, without first obtaining the written consent of the institution.

        (2) As an alternative to receiving a list of stockholders, a stockholder may request the institution mail or otherwise furnish to each stockholder a communication for a permissible purpose on behalf of the requesting stockholder. This alternative may be used at the discretion of the requesting stockholder, provided that the requester agrees to defray the reasonable costs of the communication. In the event the requester decides to exercise this option, the institution must provide the requester with a written estimate of the costs of handling and mailing the communication as soon as practicable after receipt of the stockholder's request to furnish a communication. However, a stockholder may not exercise this option when requesting the list to distribute campaign material for election to the institution board or board committees. Farm Credit banks and associations are prohibited from distributing or mailing campaign material under § 611.320(e) of this chapter.

        (3) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section “permissible purpose” is defined to mean matters relating to the business operations of the institutions.

      Subpart C—Quarterly Report

        § 620.10   Preparing the quarterly report.

#### § § 620.10

        (a) Each institution of the Farm Credit System must:

        (1) Prepare and send to the Farm Credit Administration an electronic copy of its quarterly report within 40 calendar days after the end of each fiscal quarter, except that no report need be prepared for the fiscal quarter that coincides with the end of the fiscal year of the institution;

        (2) Publish a copy of its quarterly report on its Web site when it electronically sends the report to the Farm Credit Administration; and

        (3) Ensure the report complies with the applicable provisions of §§ 620.2 and 620.3.

        (b) The report shall contain, at a minimum, the information specified in § 620.11 and, in addition, such other material information (including significant events) as is necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

        (c) Institutions may use the quarterly report to deliver any notice required under § 620.15. Notices required under § 620.17 must be issued separately from the quarterly report, unless otherwise authorized by the Farm Credit Administration.

> [62 FR 15093, Mar. 31, 1997, as amended at 71 FR 76120, Dec. 20, 2006; 74 FR 28600, June 17, 2009; 77 FR 60600, Oct. 3, 2012]

        § 620.11   Content of quarterly report to shareholders.

#### § § 620.11

        (a)  The information required to be included in the quarterly report may be presented in any format deemed suitable by the institution, except as otherwise required by this section. The report must be organized in an easily understandable format and not presented in a manner that is misleading.

        (b)  For purposes of this section, major captions to be provided in the financial statements are the same as those provided in the financial statements contained in the institution's annual report to shareholders, except that the financial statements included in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph. If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this subpart with respect to any item is not material, it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.

        (1)  When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

        (2)  When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.

        (3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. Institutions may presume that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices), and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recent completed fiscal year may be omitted. However, disclosure shall be provided of events occurring subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year that have a material impact on the institution. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices; estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements; status of long-term contracts; capitalization, including significant new indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements; and the reporting entity resulting from business combinations or dispositions.

        (4) The interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.

        (c)  A quarterly report must, at a minimum, contain the following items:

        (1)  Discuss material changes, if any, to the information provided to shareholders pursuant to § 620.5(g) that have occurred during the periods specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Such additional information as is needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be provided.

        (i)  Discuss any material changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material changes in financial conditions from that date to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided also shall be discussed. If discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be combined at the discretion of the institution.

        (ii)  Discuss any material changes in the institution's results of operations with respect to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year. Such discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year. In addition, if the institution has elected to provide an income statement for the 12-month period ended as of the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that 12-month period and the 12-month period ended as of the corresponding interim balance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year.

        (2)  The following financial statements must be provided:

        (i) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and as of the end of the preceding fiscal year. A balance sheet for the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year is optional.

        (ii) Interim statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable periods for the previous fiscal year.

        (iii) Interim statements of changes in protected borrower capital and at-risk capital for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.

        (iv) For banks, interim statements of cash flows for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year. For associations, interim statements of cash flows are optional.

        (3)  State that the financial statements were prepared under the oversight of the audit committee. The interim financial information need not be audited or reviewed by a qualified public accountant or external auditor prior to filing. If, however, a review of the data is made in accordance with the established professional standards and procedures for such a review, the institution may state that a qualified public accountant or external auditor has performed such a review under the supervision of the institution's audit committee. If such a statement is made, the report of a qualified public accountant or external auditor on such review must accompany the interim financial information.

        (d)  Institutions using the quarterly report to deliver any notice required under § 620.15 must put the notice information at the beginning of the quarterly report. The notice must be conspicuous and may not be part of any footnotes to the quarterly report.

      Subpart C—Loan Performance and Valuation Assessment

        § 621.6   Categorizing high-risk loans and other property owned.

#### § § 621.6

        Each institution must employ the practices of this section when categorizing high-risk loans and loan-related assets. A loan must not be put into more than one performance category.

        (a)  A loan is categorized as nonaccrual if there is a known risk to the continued collection of principal or interest. Once a loan is categorized as nonaccrual, it must remain in that category until reinstated to accrual status pursuant to § 621.9. Loans placed into nonaccrual status when current are also subject to the notice and review provisions of part 617 of this chapter. A loan must be categorized as nonaccrual if one or more of the following conditions exist:

        (1) The loan may or may not be past due, but the institution has determined collection of the outstanding principal and interest, plus future interest accruals, over the full term of the loan is not expected because of a documented deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower;

        (2) The loan is 90 days or more past due and is not otherwise eligible for categorization under paragraph (c) of this section; or

        (3) Legal action, including foreclosure or other forms of collateral conveyance, has been initiated to collect the outstanding principal and interest.

        (b)  A loan is categorized as a formally restructured loan (Troubled Debt Restructure(TDR)) if the restructuring is determined to be a TDR under generally accepted accounting principles and the guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

        (c)  A loan is categorized as 90 days past due still accruing interest when it is 90 days or more contractually past due, adequately secured, and in the process of collection. If the loan is not adequately secured, it cannot be categorized under this category unless there is evidence to suggest repayment within a reasonable time period of either the past due amount or the remaining principal and interest owed.

        (d)  Any real or personal property, other than an interest-earning asset, that has been acquired as a result of full or partial liquidation of a loan, through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or other legal means.

> [85 FR 52253, Aug. 25, 2020]

        § 621.7   Rule of aggregation.

#### § § 621.7

        (a) When one loan to a borrower is placed in nonaccrual, an institution must immediately evaluate whether its other loans to that borrower, or related borrowers, should also be placed in nonaccrual. All loans on which a borrowing entity, or a component of a borrowing entity, is primarily obligated to the reporting institution shall be considered as one loan unless a review of all pertinent facts supports a reasonable determination that a particular loan constitutes an independent credit risk and such determination is adequately documented in the loan file.

        (1) A loan shall be considered an independent credit risk if a substantial portion of the loan is guaranteed as to principal and interest by a government agency.

        (2) Other loans shall be considered independent credit risks if and so long as:

        (i) The primary sources of repayment are independent for each loan;

        (ii) The loans are not cross-collateralized; and

        (iii) The principal obligors are different person(s) and/or entity(ies). Related loans will not be considered independent credit risks if the operations of a related borrower are so financially interdependent with the borrower's operations that the economic survival of one will materially affect the economic survival of the other, determined in accordance with § 614.4359(a)(2) of this chapter.

        (b) If the evaluation required by paragraph (a) of this section results in a determination that the borrower's other loans with the institution do not represent an independent credit risk, and full collection of such loans is not expected, then all of the borrower's loans must be aggregated and classified as nonaccrual. If such other loans represent an independent credit risk and are fully collectible, then they may remain in their current performance category.

        (c) When an institution becomes aware that a borrower has a loan that has been classified nonaccrual by any other lender, the institution must re-evaluate the credit risk in its loan to the borrower and then determine whether an independent credit risk exists.

        § 621.8   Application of payments and income recognition on nonaccrual loans.

#### § § 621.8

        Each institution shall employ the following practices with respect to application of cash payments on nonaccrual loans:

        (a) If the ultimate collectibility of the recorded investment, in whole or in part, is in doubt, any payment received on such loan shall be applied to reduce the recorded investment to the extent necessary to eliminate such doubt.

        (b) Once the ultimate collectibility of the recorded investment is no longer in doubt, payments received in cash on such loan may qualify for recognition as interest income if all of the following characteristics are met at the time the payment is received:

        (1) The loan does not have a remaining unrecovered prior chargeoff associated with it, except in cases where the prior chargeoff was taken as part of a formal restructuring of the loan;

        (2) The payment received has come from a source of repayment detailed in the plan of collection;

        (3) The loan, after considering the payment, is not contractually past due more than 90 days and is not expected to become 90 days past due, or a repayment pattern has been established that reasonably demonstrates future repayment capacity.

        (c) The institution shall employ the following practices with respect to earned but uncollected interest income on loans, leases, contracts, and similar assets that are determined not to be fully collectible:

        (1) Earned but uncollected interest income that was accrued in the current fiscal year and is determined to be uncollectible shall be reversed from interest income; and

        (2) Earned but uncollected interest income that was accrued in prior fiscal years and is determined to be uncollectible shall be charged off against the allowance for credit losses.

        § 621.9   Reinstatement to accrual status.

#### § § 621.9

        (a) Before being reinstated to accrual status, a loan must be current on contractual payments and the borrower offered servicing in accordance with the institution's policies maintained under either § 614.4170 or part 617 of this chapter, whichever is applicable. Additional reinstatement eligibility requirements are dependent upon certain characteristics of the loan under review.

        (1) A loan that was current when placed in nonaccrual status pursuant to § 621.6(a)(1) may be reinstated to accrual status if the known risks to the continued collection of principal or interest have been mitigated. If the loan was past due when placed in nonaccrual status, it may only be reinstated under either paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, as applicable.

        (2) A loan placed in nonaccrual status when past due and not adequately secured must remain current on contractual payments for a period of sustained performance before it may be reinstated.

        (3) A loan placed in nonaccrual status when past due and adequately secured must have a recent repayment pattern demonstrating future repayment capacity to make on-time payments before it may be reinstated. The repayment pattern is established in one of two ways:

        (i) Sustained performance in making on-time contractual payments, or

        (ii) A recent history of making on-time partial payments in amounts the same or greater than newly restructured payment amounts.

        (b) Nothing in this section prevents a current loan from being reinstated to accrual status in response to a Credit Review Committee decision issued under section 4.14D(d) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, when that decision was made in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

        (2) In accordance with § 620.5(g)(1)(iv)(A) of this chapter, disclose to shareholders, investors, boards of directors, and the Farm Credit Administration the nature and extent of significant potential credit risks within the loan portfolio, or other information that could adversely impact performance of the loan portfolio in the near future;

        (3) Develop, adopt, and consistently apply policies and procedures governing performance categories and other property owned, which, at a minimum, conform to the definitions, rules, and standards set forth in this part and such other requirements and procedures as may be required by the Farm Credit Administration;

        (4) Review the loan portfolio at least quarterly to ensure that all high-risk loans have been assigned the appropriate performance category; and

        (5) Review all high-risk loans in the loan portfolio at least quarterly to determine the collectibility of accrued but uncollected income, if any.

        (b) Measures taken to enhance the collectibility of a loan shall not be deemed to relieve an institution of the requirement to monitor and evaluate the loan for the purpose of determining its performance status.

        § 622.3   Appearance and practice.

#### § § 622.3

        (a) —(1)  An individual may appear in his or her own behalf; a member of a partnership may represent the partnership; a duly authorized officer or other agent of a corporation, trust association or other entity not specifically listed herein may represent the corporation, trust association, or other entity; and a duly authorized officer or employee of any government unit, agency or authority may represent that unit, agency or authority. Any person appearing in a representative capacity shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board which shall contain evidence of his or her authority to act in such capacity.

        (2)  A party may be represented by an attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State, possession, territory, Commonwealth or the District of Columbia, and who has not been suspended or debarred from practice before the FCA in accordance with the provisions of part 623 of this chapter. Prior to appearing, an attorney representing a person in a proceeding shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board, which shall contain a declaration that he or she is currently qualified as provided by paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is authorized to represent the party on whose behalf he or she acts.

        (3)  A person shall not represent more than one party without informing each party of any actual or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in such representation. Such person shall file a statement with the Board indicating that such disclosure has been made. The presiding officer has authority to take protective measures at any stage of a proceeding, including the authority to prohibit multiple representation when deemed appropriate.

        (b)  Dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous, contumacious, or other unethical or improper conduct at any proceeding before the Board or a presiding officer shall be grounds for exclusion therefrom and suspension for the duration of the proceeding, or other appropriate action by the Board or presiding officer.

        § 622.4   Commencement of proceedings.

#### § § 622.4

        Proceedings under this subpart are commenced by the issuance of a notice by the Board. Such notice shall state the time, place, and nature of the hearing, the name and address of the presiding officer if one has been designated, and a statement of the matters of fact and law constituting the grounds for the hearing. The matters of fact and law alleged in a notice may be amended by the Board at any stage of the proceeding and such amended notice may require an answer from the party or parties served and may set a new hearing date. A copy of any notice served by the FCA on any System association, director, officer or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association will also be sent to the supervisory bank.

        § 622.5   Answer.

#### § § 622.5

        (a)  Unless a different period is specified by the Board, a party who does not wish to consent to a final order must file an answer within 20 days after being served with a notice that commences the proceeding. Any subsequent notice which contains amended allegations and by its terms requires an answer must similarly be answered within 20 days after service.

        (b)  An answer filed under this section shall concisely state any defenses and specifically admit or deny each allegation in the notice. A party who lacks information or knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of any particular allegation shall so state and this shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed to be admitted. A party who intends in good faith to deny only a part of or to qualify an allegation shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder.

        (c)  If a party filing an answer under this section elects not to contest any of the allegations of fact set forth in the notice, the answer shall consist of a statement admitting all of the allegations to be true. Such answer constitutes a waiver of hearing as to the facts alleged in the notice, and together with the notice will provide a record basis on which the presiding officer shall file with the Board a recommended decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 557. The recommended decision shall be served on the party, who may file exceptions thereto within the time provided in § 622.13.

        (d)  Failure of a party to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the party's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice and authorizes the presiding officer, without further notice to the party, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice and to file with the Board a recommended decision containing such findings and appropriate conclusions. The Board or the presiding officer may, for good cause shown, permit the filing of a delayed answer after the time for filing and the answer has expired.

        § 622.6   Opportunity for informal settlement.

#### § § 622.6

        Any interested party may at any time submit to the Board for consideration written offers or proposals for settlement of a proceeding, without prejudice to the rights of the parties. No offer or proposal shall be admissible into evidence over the objection of any party in any hearing in connection with such proceeding. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not preclude settlement of any proceeding through the regular adjudicatory process by the filing of an answer as provided in § 622.5(c), or by submission of the case to the presiding officer on a stipulation of facts and an agreed order.

        § 622.7   Conduct of hearings.

#### § § 622.7

        (a)  All hearings governed by this subpart shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5 of the United States Code. The presiding officer designated by the Board to preside at any such hearing shall have complete charge of the hearing, shall have the duty to conduct it in a fair and impartial manner and shall take all necessary action to avoid delay in the disposition of the proceeding. Such officer shall have all powers necessary to that end, including the following:

        (1) To administer oaths and affirmations;

        (2) To issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, as authorized by law, and to revoke, quash, or modify any such subpoena;

        (3) To receive relevant evidence and to rule upon the admission of evidence and offers of proof;

        (4) To take or cause depositions to be taken;

        (5) To regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the parties and their counsel;

        (6) To hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues or for any proper purpose; and

        (7) To consider and rule upon, as justice may require, all procedural and other motions appropriate in a proceeding under this subpart, except that a presiding officer shall not have power to decide any motion to dismiss the proceeding or other motion which results in a final determination of the merits of the proceeding. This power rests only with the Board. Without limitation on the foregoing, the presiding officer shall, subject to the provisions of this subpart, have all the authority set forth in 5 U.S.C. 556(c).

        (b)  The presiding officer may, on his or her own initiative or at the request of any party, direct counsel for all parties to meet with him or her at a specified time and place prior to the hearing, or to submit suggestions to him or her in writing, for the purpose of considering any or all of the following:

        (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;

        (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact and of the contents and authenticity of documents;

        (3) Matters of which official notice will be taken; and

        (4) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the proceeding.

        (c)  Thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, parties shall exchange a list of the names of witnesses with a general description of their expected testimony, and a list and one copy of all documents or other physical exhibits which will be introduced in evidence in the course of the proceeding.

        (d)  All hearings shall be private and shall be attended only by the parties, their counsel or authorized representatives, witnesses while testifying, and other persons having an official interest in the proceeding. However, if the Board, in its discretion, after fully considering the views of the party afforded the hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect the public interest, the Board may in its sole discretion order that the hearing be public.

        (e)  Hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the transcript of the testimony taken at any hearing, duly certified by the reporter, together with all exhibits accepted into evidence shall be filed with the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall promptly serve notice upon all parties of such filing. The parties shall make their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and exhibits. The presiding officer shall have authority to correct the record sua sponte with notice to all parties and to rule upon motions to correct the record. In the event the hearing is public, transcripts will be furnished to interested persons upon payment of the cost thereof.

        (f)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the presiding officer may extend time limits prescribed by these rules or by any notice or order issued in the proceedings, may change the time for beginning any hearing, continue or adjourn a hearing from time to time, and/or change the location of the hearing. Prior to the appointment of a presiding officer and after the filing of a recommended decision pursuant to § 622.12, the Board may grant such extensions or changes. Subject to the approval of the presiding officer, the parties may by stipulation change the time limits specified by these rules or any notice or order issued hereunder.

        (g)  The record of the hearing shall be closed by an announcement to that effect by the presiding officer when the taking of evidence has been concluded. In the discretion of the presiding officer, the record may be closed as of a future date in order to permit the admission into the record, under circumstances determined by the presiding officer, of exhibits to be prepared.

        (h)  The presiding officer may call for the production of further evidence upon any issue, may permit oral argument and submission of briefs at the hearing and, upon appropriate notice, may reopen any hearing at any time prior to the filing of his or her recommended decision. The Board may reopen the record at anytime permitted by law.

        (i)  The FCA shall open and close.

        (j)  (1) No person shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding to the presiding officer or anyone who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process.

        (2) No person who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding to any person.

        (3) Except as authorized by law, the presiding officer shall not consult anyone on any fact in issue, unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. The presiding officer shall not be responsible to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, any officer, employee, or agent of the FCA engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions. An officer, employee or agent engaged in the performance of such functions in any case shall not, in that case or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision of the presiding officer, except as a witness or counsel in the proceedings, or as otherwise authorized by law.

        (4) If an ex parte communication is made or knowingly caused to be made, all such communications, and any responses, shall be placed in the record.

        (5) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or caused to be made in violation of paragraph (j) of this section, the responsible party may be required to show cause why such party's claim or interest should not be dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected. To the extent consistent with the interests of justice, a knowing violation of paragraph (j) of this section may be grounds for a decision adverse to a party in violation.

        (6) The prohibitions against ex parte communications apply from the time a proceeding is noticed for hearing. However, when the person responsible for the communication has knowledge that the proceeding will be noticed, the prohibitions apply from the time such knowledge is acquired.

        § 622.8   Rules of evidence.

#### § § 622.8

        (a)  Every party shall have the right to present a case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

        (b)  Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon but no argument thereon shall be permitted, except as ordered, allowed, or requested by the presiding officer. Rulings on such objections and all other matters shall be part of the transcript. Failure to object timely to the admission or exclusion of evidence or to any ruling constitutes a waiver of such objection.

        (c)  Independently of the orders or rulings issued as provided by § 622.7(b), the parties may stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact or the authenticity of any relevant documents. Such stipulations may be received in evidence at the hearing, and when so received shall be binding on the parties with respect to the matters therein stipulated.

        (d)  All matters officially noticed by the presiding officer shall appear on the record.

        § 622.9   Subpoenas.

#### § § 622.9

        (a)  The presiding officer or, in the event he or she is unavailable, the Board may issue subpoenas and subpoena duces tecum at the request of any party requiring the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents at a designated place. The person seeking the subpoena may be required, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. Where it appears to the presiding officer that a subpoena may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or delay the proceeding, the presiding officer has discretion to refuse to issue a subpoena or to issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires.

        (b)  Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance but in no event more than 10 days after the date the subpoena was served, with notice to the party requesting the subpoena, apply to the presiding officer, or in the event he or she is unavailable to the Board, to quash or modify the subpoena, accompanying such application with a brief statement of the reasons therefor. The presiding officer may deny the application or, upon notice to the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and after affording that party an opportunity to reply, may quash or modify the subpoena or impose reasonable conditions including, in the case of a subpoena duces tecum, a requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued pay in advance the reasonable cost of copying and transporting the documentary evidence to the designated place.

        (c)  A subpoena may be served upon the person named therein by personal service or certified mail with a return receipt to the last known address of the person. The fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be tendered at the time of service unless the subpoena is issued on behalf of the FCA. If personal service is made by a U.S. marshal, a deputy U.S. marshal, or an employee of the FCA, such service shall be evidenced by the return thereon. If personal service is made by any other person, such person shall sign an affidavit describing the manner in which service is made, and return such affidavit with a copy of the subpoena. In case of failure to make service, reasons for the failure shall be stated on the original subpoena. The original or a copy of the subpoena, bearing or accompanied by the required return, affidavit, statement or return receipt, shall be returned without delay to the presiding officer.

        (d)  The attendance of witnesses at a designated place may be required from any place in any State or territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Witnesses who are subpoenaed shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States. Fees required by this paragraph shall be paid by the party upon whose application the subpoena is issued.

        (e)  The production of documents at a designated place may be required from any place in any State or territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. In lieu of an original document, a certified or authenticated copy may be produced. However, any party has the right to inspect the original document.

        § 622.10   Depositions.

#### § § 622.10

        (a)  Any party desiring to take the deposition of any person shall make written application to the presiding officer setting forth the name and address of the witness, the subject matter concerning which the witness is expected to testify, its relevance, the time and place of the deposition, and the reasons why such deposition should be taken. The application may include a request that specified documents be produced at the deposition. A copy of the application shall be served on the other parties at the same time the application is filed with the presiding officer.

        (b)  Upon a showing that the testimony or other evidence sought will be material, and the taking of the deposition will not result in any undue burden to the witness or any party or undue delay of the proceedings, the presiding officer may issue a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum. Notice of the issuance of such subpoena shall be served upon all parties at least 10 days in advance of the date set for deposition.

        (c)  The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be waived by agreement of the parties and the witness whose testimony or documentary evidence is sought. Such agreement shall be embodied in a stipulation which becomes part of the record and may provide for the taking of depositions upon notice without leave of the presiding officer.

        (d)  Depositions may be taken before any person having the power to administer oaths. Each witness whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be duly sworn before any question is propounded. Examination and cross-examination of deponents may proceed as permitted at the hearing. Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds relief upon for the objection. Failure to object to questions or evidence is deemed a waiver if the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, together with all objections made (but not including argument or debate) shall be recorded by or under the direction of the person before whom the deposition is taken. The deposition shall be signed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is physically unable to sign, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. The deposition shall also be certified as a true and complete transcript by the person recording the testimony. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the person recording the testimony shall state this fact and the reason therefor on the record. The person before whom the deposition is taken shall promptly file the transcript and all exhibits with the presiding officer. Interested parties shall make their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and exhibits.

        (e)  Subject to appropriate rulings by the presiding officer on such objections and answers as were noted at the time the deposition was taken or as would be valid were the witness personally present and testifying at the hearing, the deposition or any part thereof may be received in evidence by the presiding officer in his or her discretion. Only such part of a deposition as is received in evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record upon which a decision may be based.

        (f)  Deponents whose depositions are taken and the reporter taking the same shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the district courts of the United States, which fees shall be paid by the party upon whose application the deposition is taken.

        § 622.11   Motions.

#### § § 622.11

        (a)  An application or request for an order or ruling not otherwise specifically provided for in this subpart, unless made during a hearing, shall be made by written motion supported by a memorandum which concisely states the grounds therefor.

        (b)  Within 10 days after service of any written motion, or within such other period of time as may be fixed by the presiding officer, any party may file a memorandum in opposition thereto. The moving party has no right to reply except as permitted by the presiding officer. The presiding officer has discretion to waive the requirements of this section as to motions for extension of time and may rule upon such motions ex parte.

        (c)  No oral argument will be heard on motions except as otherwise directed by the presiding officer or the Board.

        (d)  Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the presiding officer shall rule on all motions and may issue appropriate orders, except that motions may be referred to the Board if the presiding officer is unavailable or determines that such motion should be referred to the Board. Prior to the appointment of a presiding officer and after a recommended decision is filed pursuant to § 622.12, the Board shall rule on motions filed by the parties.

        (e)  All answers, motions, objections and rulings shall become part of the record. Rulings of a presiding officer on any motion may not be appealed to the Board prior to its consideration of the presiding officer's recommended decision, except by special permission of the Board. However, such rulings shall be considered by the Board in reviewing the record. Requests to the Board for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer shall be filed in writing within 5 days of the ruling, and shall briefly state the grounds relied on. The moving party shall immediately serve a copy thereof on every other party to the proceeding who may then respond to such request within 5 days after service.

        (f)  Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer or the Board, the hearing shall continue pending the determination of any request or motion by the Board.

        § 622.12   Proposed findings and conclusions; recommended decision.

#### § § 622.12

        (a)  Within 30 days after the hearing transcript has been filed, any party may file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such proposals shall be supported by citation of such statutes, decisions, and other authorities, and by specific page references to such portions of the record as may be relevant. All such proposals shall become a part of the record.

        (b)  Within 30 days after the expiration of time allowed under paragraph (a) of this section, or within such further time as the Board for good cause allows, the presiding officer shall file the entire hearing record, including a recommended decision and findings and conclusions, the transcript, exhibits (including on request of any of the parties any exhibits excluded from evidence or tender of proof), exceptions, rulings and all briefs and memoranda filed in connection with the hearing. Promptly upon such filing, the presiding officer shall serve a copy of the recommended decision, findings and conclusions upon each party to the proceeding.

        (c)  In proceedings in which the Board or one or more of its members has presided at the reception of evidence, the presiding officer's recommended decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law will be omitted. In such proceedings the proposed findings and conclusions, briefs, and other submissions permitted under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed with the Board for consideration.

        § 622.13   Exceptions.

#### § § 622.13

        (a)  Within 15 days after service of the recommended decision of the presiding officer, any party may file exceptions thereto or to any portion thereof, or to the failure of the presiding officer to make any recommendation, finding, or conclusion, or to the admission or exclusion of evidence, or to any other ruling of the presiding officer.

        (b)  Each exception shall be supported by a concise argument and by citation of such statutes, decisions and other authorities, and by page references to such portions of the record as may be relevant. If the exception relates to the admission or exclusion of evidence, the substance of the evidence admitted or excluded shall be set forth in the brief with appropriate references to the transcript.

        (c)  Failure of a party to file exceptions to those matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section within the time prescribed shall be a waiver of objection thereto.

        § 622.14   Briefs.

#### § § 622.14

        (a)  Any brief filed in a proceeding shall be confined to the particular matters in issue, citing statutes, decisions, and other authorities, and page references to such portions of the record or the recommended decision of the presiding officer as may be relevant.

        (b)  Reply briefs may be filed within 10 days after service of original briefs of opposing parties, and shall be confined to matters in such briefs. Further briefs may be filed only with permission of the presiding officer or the Board with respect to a matter before the Board.

#### § § 622.15

        Upon its own initiative or upon written request by any party, the Board, in its discretion, may order the matter to be set down for oral argument before the Board or one or more members thereof. Any request for oral argument by a party filing exceptions shall be made within the time prescribed for filing such exceptions, or by any other party, within the time prescribed for the filing of a reply brief. Oral argument before the Board shall be recorded unless otherwise ordered by the Board.

        § 622.16   Notice of submission to the Board.

#### § § 622.16

        Upon the filing of the record with the Board, and upon the expiration of the time for the filing of exceptions and all briefs, including reply briefs or any further briefs permitted by the presiding officer or the Board, and upon the hearing of oral argument by the Board, if ordered by the Board, the Board shall notify the parties in writing that the case has been submitted for final decision.

        § 622.17   Decision of the Board.

#### § § 622.17

        Any person who has not engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in the case, or in a factually related case, may advise and assist the Board in the consideration of the case.

A copy of the order will also be sent to the supervisory bank if the order relates to a System association, director, officer, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association.

The proof shall show the date and manner of service, and may be by written acknowledgment of service, by declaration of the person making service, or by certificate of an attorney or other representative of record. Failure to make proof of service shall not affect the validity of service.

#### § § 622.20

#### § § 622.60

        (a)  Generally, the date designated in the notice of assessment for payment of the civil money penalty will be 60 days from the issuance of the notice. If, however, the Board finds, in a specific case, that the purposes of the relevant statutes would be better served if the 60-day period were changed, the Board may shorten or lengthen the period or make the civil money penalty payable immediately upon receipt of the notice of assessment. If a timely request for a formal hearing to challenge an assessment of a civil money penalty is filed, payment of the penalty will not be required unless and until the Board issues a final order of assessment following the hearing. If an assessment order is issued, it will specify the date by which the civil money penalty is to be paid or collected.

        (b)  Checks in payment of civil money penalties must be made payable to the “Farm Credit Administration.” Upon collection, the FCA will forward payment for penalties described in § 622.52(a) and (b) to the United States Department of Treasury.

Any notice or order shall indicate the basis for the suspension, prohibition, or removal and shall inform the individual of the right to request in writing, within 30 days of being served with such notice or order, an opportunity to show at an informal hearing that continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System.

        (b)  A notice or order of suspension, removal or prohibition may be served by personal service or by certified mail with a return receipt to the last known address of the person being served.

        (3) Include a request to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, if the petitioner desires to do so. The request should specify the names of the witnesses and a summary of their expected testimony; and

        § 622.80   Informal hearing.

#### § § 622.80

        (a)  Upon receipt of a timely petition for a hearing, the Board shall notify the petitioner of the time and place fixed for the hearing and shall designate one or more Board members or FCA employees to preside (“designated FCA representative”). The hearing shall be scheduled to be held no later than 30 days from the date a petition for hearing is received unless the time is extended at the request of the petitioner. Notice of the hearing shall also be sent to the FCA's Office of General Counsel.

        (b)  A petitioner may appear personally or through counsel to submit relevant written materials and oral argument. An attorney is subject to all the requirements and limitations imposed on attorneys in § 622.3 of subpart A. A representative(s) of the FCA's Office of General Counsel may participate in the hearing to the extent such representative deems appropriate.

The designated FCA representative shall promptly serve notice upon the petitioner and the FCA's Office of General Counsel of such filing. Such parties shall make arrangements with the person recording the testimony or argument for copies of the transcript.

        (f)  Upon the request of the petitioner or representative of the FCA's Office of General Counsel, the record shall remain open for a period of 5 business days following the hearing, during which time additional submissions for the record may be made. Thereafter, the record shall be closed.

        (g)  Neither the formal rules of evidence nor the adjudicative procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) or subpart A of these rules shall apply to the informal hearing ordered under this subpart unless the Board orders that they apply in whole or in part.

        § 622.81   Default.

#### § § 622.81

        If the subject individual fails to file a petition for a hearing, or fails to appear at a hearing, either in person or by an attorney, or fails to submit a written argument where oral argument has been waived, the notice shall remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of and the order shall remain in effect until terminated by the Board.

The Board's final decision, if adverse to the individual, shall contain a statement of the basis thereof. The Board may satisfy this requirement where it adopts the recommended decision of the designated FCA representative.

        (c)  In deciding upon any suspension of prohibition by notice, the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence of the individual with respect to the criminal charge that is outstanding will not be considered. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from thereafter instituting removal proceedings pursuant to section 5.28 of the Act.

        (d)  A removal or prohibition by order remains in effect until terminated by the Board. A suspension or prohibition by notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Board.

        (e)  A suspended or removed individual may petition the Board to reconsider the decision any time after the expiration of a 12-month period from the date of the decision, but no petition for reconsideration may be made within 12 months of a previous petition. A petition shall state with particularity the relief sought and the grounds therefor and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and any other documentation the petitioner wishes to have considered. No hearing need be granted on the petition for reconsideration.

      (1) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others;

      (4) A conviction (including a judgment or order on a plea of nolo contendere), revocation, suspension or disbarment under paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section shall be deemed to have occurred when the convicting, revoking, suspending or disbarring agency or tribunal enters its judgment or order, regardless of whether an appeal is pending or could be taken.

      (5) For purposes of this section, it shall be irrelevant that any attorney, accountant, appraiser or licensed expert who has been suspended, disbarred or otherwise disqualified from practice before a court, regulatory authority, or in a jurisdiction continues in professional good standing before other courts, regulatory authorities, or in other jurisdictions.

      (c)  (1) The Board, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, by order, may temporarily suspend any person from appearing or practicing before it who by name, has been:

      (i) Permanently enjoined (whether by consent, default or summary judgment or after trial) by any court of competent jurisdiction or by the Board in a final administrative order, by reason of his or her misconduct in any action brought by the FCA based upon violations of, or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of any law that is administered by the FCA or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder; or

      (ii) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after hearing) or in any administrative proceeding in which the FCA is a complainant and he or she is a party, to have willfully committed, caused, aided or abetted a violation of any provision of any law that is administered by the FCA, or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.

      (2) An order of temporary suspension shall become effective when served by certified mail with a return receipt directed to the last known business or residential address of the person involved. No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the Board pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section more than 3 months after the final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section has become effective and all review or appeal procedures have been completed or are no longer available.

      (3) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the FCA in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, within 30 days after service of the order of temporary suspension, petition the Board to lift such suspension. If no petition is received by the Board within 30 days, the suspension shall become permanent.

      (4) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Board shall either lift the temporary suspension or set the matter down for hearing at a time and place to be designated by the Board, or both. After opportunity for hearing, the Board may censure the petitioner or may suspend the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the FCA temporarily or permanently. In any case in which the temporary suspension has not been lifted, the hearing and any other action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall be expedited by the Board in order to ensure the petitioner's right to address the allegations.

      (5) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a showing that the petitioner has been enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused, aided or abetted violations as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, without more, may be a basis for suspension or debarment; that showing having been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why the petitioner should not be censured or be temporarily or permanently suspended or debarred.

#### § § 623.5

      (a) Any person who is suspended from practicing before the FCA under § 623.4 (a) or (c) of this part may file an application for reinstatement at any time.

      § 624.1   Authority, purpose, scope, exemptions and compliance dates.

#### § § 624.1

      (a)  This part is issued by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) under section 4s(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s(e)), section 15F(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(e)), and sections 4.3, 5.9, 5.17, and 8.32 of the Farm Credit Act (12 U.S.C. 2154, 12 U.S.C. 2243, 12 U.S.C. 2252, and 12 U.S.C. 2279bb-1).

      (b)  Section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s) and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10) require the FCA to establish capital and margin requirements for any System institution, including the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, chartered under the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (12 U.S.C. 2001 ) that is registered as a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This regulation implements section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by defining terms used in the statute and related terms, establishing capital and margin requirements, and explaining the statutes' requirements.

      (c)  This part establishes minimum capital and margin requirements for each covered swap entity subject to this part with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This part applies to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by a covered swap entity on or after the relevant compliance date set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Nothing in this part is intended to prevent a covered swap entity from collecting margin in amounts greater than are required under this part.

      (d) —(1)  The requirements of this part (except for § 624.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared swap if the counterparty:

      (i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(A)) and implementing regulations;

      (ii) Qualifies for an exemption from clearing under a rule, regulation, or order that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued pursuant to its authority under section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1)) concerning cooperative entities that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(1)(A)); or

      (iii) Satisfies the criteria in section 2(h)(7)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(D)) and implementing regulations.

      (2)  The requirements of this part (except for § 624.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared security-based swap if the counterparty:

      (i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 3C(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(1)) and implementing regulations; or

      (ii) Satisfies the criteria in section 3C(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(4)) and implementing regulations.

      (e)  Covered swap entities shall comply with the minimum margin requirements of this part on or before the following dates for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the following dates:

      (1) September 1, 2016 with respect to the requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin and § 624.4 for variation margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:

      (i) The covered swap entity combined with all its affiliates; and

      (ii) Its counterparty combined with all its affiliates, have an average daily aggregate notional amount of non-cleared swaps, non-cleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps for March, April and May 2016 that exceeds $3 trillion, where such amounts are calculated only for business days; and

      (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2) March 1, 2017 with respect to the requirements in § 624.4 for variation margin for any other covered swap entity with respect to non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into with any other counterparty.

      (3) September 1, 2017 with respect to the requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:

      (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

      (4) September 1, 2018 with respect to the requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:

      (i) The covered swap entity combined with all its affiliates; and

      (ii) Its counterparty combined with all its affiliates, have an average daily aggregate notional amount of non-cleared swaps, non-cleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps for March, April and May 2018 that exceeds $1.5 trillion, where such amounts are calculated only for business days; and

      (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

      (5) September 1, 2019 with respect to the requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:

      (i) The covered swap entity combined with all its affiliates; and

      (ii) Its counterparty combined with all its affiliates, have an average daily aggregate notional amount of non-cleared swaps, non-cleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps for March, April and May 2019 that exceeds $0.75 trillion, where such amounts are calculated only for business days; and

      (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

      (6) September 1, 2021 with respect to requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:

      (i) The covered swap entity combined with all its affiliates; and

      (ii) Its counterparty combined with all its affiliates, have an average daily aggregate notional amount of non-cleared swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps for March, April and May 2021 that exceeds $50 billion, where such amounts are calculated only for business days; and

      (iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

      (7) September 1, 2022 with respect to requirements in § 624.3 for initial margin for any other covered swap entity with respect to non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into with any other counterparty.

      (f) Once a covered swap entity must comply with the margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with respect to a particular counterparty based on the compliance dates in paragraph (e) of this section, the covered swap entity shall remain subject to the requirements of this part with respect to that counterparty.

      (g)(1) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with that counterparty becomes subject to stricter margin requirements under this part (such as if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user without material swaps exposure to a financial end user with material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity shall comply with the stricter margin requirements for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status.

      (2) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with that counterparty becomes subject to less strict margin requirements under this part (such as if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user with material swaps exposure to a financial end user without material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity may comply with the less strict margin requirements for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status as well as for any outstanding non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into after the applicable compliance date in paragraph (e) of this section and before the counterparty changed its status.

      (h)  Covered swaps entities are required to comply with the requirements of this subpart for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the relevant compliance dates for variation margin and for initial margin established in paragraph (e) of this section. Any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into before such relevant date shall remain outside the scope of this subpart if amendments are made to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap by method of adherence to a protocol, other amendment of a contract or confirmation, or execution of a new contract or confirmation in replacement of and immediately upon termination of an existing contract or confirmation, as follows:

      (1) Amendments to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap solely to comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 47, 12 CFR part 252 subpart I, or 12 CFR part 382, as applicable;

      (2) The non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap was amended under the following conditions:

      (i) The swap was originally entered into before the relevant compliance date established in paragraph (e) of this section and one party to the swap booked it at, or otherwise held it at, an entity (including a branch or other authorized form of establishment) located in the United Kingdom;

      (ii) The entity in the United Kingdom subsequently arranged to amend the swap, solely for the purpose of transferring it to an affiliate, or a branch or other authorized form of establishment, located in any European Union member state or the United States, in connection with the entity's planning for or response to the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, and the transferee is:

      (A) A covered swap entity, or

      (B) A covered swap entity's counterparty to the swap, and the counterparty represents to the covered swap entity that the counterparty performed the transfer in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section;

      (iii) The law of the European Union ceases to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, without conclusion of a Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union pursuant to Article 50(2);

      (iv) The amendments do not modify any of the following: The payment amount calculation methods, the maturity date, or the notional amount of the swap;

      (v) The amendments cause the transfer to take effect on or after the date of the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section transpires; and

      (vi) The amendments cause the transfer to take effect by the later of:

      (A) The date that is one year after the date of the event described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section; or

      (B) Such other date permitted by transitional provisions under Article 35 of Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) No. 2016/2251, as amended.

      (3)(i) Amendments to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap that are made solely to accommodate the replacement of:

      (A) An interbank offered rate (IBOR) including, but not limited to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), and the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR);

      (B) Any other interest rate that a covered swap entity reasonably expects to be replaced or discontinued or reasonably determines has lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment; or

      (C) Any other interest rate that succeeds a rate referenced in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. An amendment made under this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(C) could be one of multiple amendments made under this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(C). For example, an amendment could replace an IBOR with a temporary interest rate and later replace the temporary interest rate with a permanent interest rate.

      (ii) Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section may also incorporate spreads or other adjustments to the replacement interest rate and make other necessary technical changes to operationalize the determination of payments or other exchanges of economic value using the replacement interest rate, including changes to determination dates, calculation agents, and payment dates. The changes may not extend the maturity or increase the total effective notional amount of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap beyond what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement.

      (iii) Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section may also be effectuated through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties. Portfolio compression under this paragraph is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, but any non-cleared swap[s] or non-cleared security-based swaps resulting from the portfolio compression may not extend the maturity or increase the total effective notional amount more than what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement.

      (4) Amendments solely to reduce risk or remain risk-neutral through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties, as long as any non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps resulting from the portfolio compression do not:

      (i) Exceed the sum of the total effective notional amounts of all of the swaps that were submitted to the compression exercise that had the same or longer remaining maturity as the resulting swap; or

      (ii) Exceed the longest remaining maturity of all the swaps submitted to the compression exercise.

      (5) The non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap was amended solely for one of the following reasons:

      (i) To reflect technical changes, such as addresses, identities of parties for delivery of formal notices, and other administrative or operational provisions as long as they do not alter the non-cleared swap's or non-cleared security-based swap's underlying asset or reference, the remaining maturity, or the total effective notional amount; or

      (ii) To reduce the notional amount, so long as:

      (A) All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully terminated; or

      (B) All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully novated to a third party, who complies with applicable margin rules for the novated portion upon the transfer.

#### § § 624.3

      (a)  A covered swap entity shall collect initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap from a counterparty that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure or that is a swap entity in an amount that is no less than the greater of:

      (b)  A covered swap entity shall post initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap to a counterparty that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure. Such initial margin shall be in an amount at least as large as the covered swap entity would be required to collect under paragraph (a) of this section if it were in the place of the counterparty.

      (c)  A covered swap entity shall comply with the initial margin requirements described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on each business day, for a period beginning on or before the business day following the day of execution and ending on the date the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap terminates or expires.

      (d)  A covered swap entity is not required to collect or post initial margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap described in § 624.1(d). For any other non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap between a covered swap entity and a counterparty that is neither a financial end user with a material swaps exposure nor a swap entity, the covered swap entity shall collect initial margin at such times and in such forms and such amounts (if any), that the covered swap entity determines appropriately addresses the credit risk posed by the counterparty and the risks of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap.

      (a)  After the date on which a covered swap entity enters into a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a swap entity or financial end user, the covered swap entity shall collect variation margin equal to the variation margin amount from the counterparty to such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap when the amount is positive and post variation margin equal to the variation margin amount to the counterparty to such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap when the amount is negative.

      (b)  A covered swap entity shall comply with the variation margin requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section on each business day, for a period beginning on or before the business day following the day of execution and ending on the date the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security based swap terminates or expires.

      (c)  A covered swap entity is not required to collect or post variation margin with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap described in § 624.1(d). For any other non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap between a covered swap entity and a counterparty that is neither a financial end user nor a swap entity, the covered swap entity shall collect variation margin at such times and in such forms and such amounts (if any), that the covered swap entity determines appropriately addresses the credit risk posed by the counterparty and the risks of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap.

#### § § 624.5

      (a)  (1) For purposes of calculating and complying with the initial margin requirements of § 624.3 using an initial margin model as described in § 624.8, or with the variation margin requirements of § 624.4, a covered swap entity may net non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with this subsection.

      (2) To the extent that one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps are executed pursuant to an eligible master netting agreement between a covered swap entity and its counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user, a covered swap entity may calculate and comply with the applicable requirements of this part on an aggregate net basis with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps governed by such agreement, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (3)(i) Except as permitted in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if an eligible master netting agreement covers non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 624.1(e) or (g), all the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps covered by that agreement are subject to the requirements of this part and included in the aggregate netting portfolio for the purposes of calculating and complying with the margin requirements of this part.

      (ii) An eligible master netting agreement may identify one or more separate netting portfolios that independently meet the requirements in paragraph (1) of the definition of “Eligible master netting agreement” in § 624.2 and to which collection and posting of margin applies on an aggregate net basis separate from and exclusive of any other non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by the eligible master netting agreement. Any such netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 624.1(e) or (g) is subject to the requirements of this part. Any such netting portfolio that contains only non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date is not subject to the requirements of this part.

      (4) If a covered swap entity cannot conclude after sufficient legal review with a well-founded basis that the netting agreement described in this section meets the definition of eligible master netting agreement set forth in § 624.2, the covered swap entity must treat the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security based swaps covered by the agreement on a gross basis for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to collect margin, but the covered swap entity may net those non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to post margin.

      (b)  Notwithstanding § 624.3 or § 624.4, a covered swap entity is not required to collect or post margin pursuant to this part with respect to a particular counterparty unless and until the combined amount of initial margin and variation margin that is required pursuant to this part to be collected or posted and that has not yet been collected or posted with respect to the counterparty is greater than $500,000.

      (c)  A covered swap entity shall not be deemed to have violated its obligation to collect or post margin from or to a counterparty under § 624.3, § 624.4, or § 624.6(e) if:

      (1) The counterparty has refused or otherwise failed to provide or accept the required margin to or from the covered swap entity; and

      (2) The covered swap entity has:

      (i) Made the necessary efforts to collect or post the required margin, including the timely initiation and continued pursuit of formal dispute resolution mechanisms, or has otherwise demonstrated upon request to the satisfaction of the FCA that it has made appropriate efforts to collect or post the required margin; or

      (ii) Commenced termination of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with the counterparty promptly following the applicable cure period and notification requirements.

      § 624.7   Segregation of collateral.

#### § § 624.7

      (a) A covered swap entity that posts any collateral other than for variation margin with respect to a non-cleared swap or a non-cleared security-based swap shall require that all funds or other property other than variation margin provided by the covered swap entity be held by one or more custodians that are not the covered swap entity or counterparty and not affiliates of the covered swap entity or the counterparty.

      (b) A covered swap entity that collects initial margin required by § 624.3(a) with respect to a non-cleared swap or a non-cleared security-based swap shall require that such initial margin be held by one or more custodians that are not the covered swap entity or counterparty and not affiliates of the covered swap entity or the counterparty.

      (c) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the custodian must act pursuant to a custody agreement that:

      (1) Prohibits the custodian from rehypothecating, repledging, reusing, or otherwise transferring (through securities lending, securities borrowing, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement or other means) the collateral held by the custodian, except that cash collateral may be held in a general deposit account with the custodian if the funds in the account are used to purchase an asset described in § 624.6(a)(2) or (b), such asset is held in compliance with this § 624.7, and such purchase takes place within a time period reasonably necessary to consummate such purchase after the cash collateral is posted as initial margin; and

      (2) Is a legal, valid, binding, and enforceable agreement under the laws of all relevant jurisdictions, including in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a custody agreement may permit the posting party to substitute or direct any reinvestment of posted collateral held by the custodian, provided that, with respect to collateral collected by a covered swap entity pursuant to § 624.3(a) or posted by a covered swap entity pursuant to § 624.3(b), the agreement requires the posting party to:

      (1) Substitute only funds or other property that would qualify as eligible collateral under § 624.6, and for which the amount net of applicable discounts described in appendix B of this part would be sufficient to meet the requirements of § 624.3; and

      (2) Direct reinvestment of funds only in assets that would qualify as eligible collateral under § 624.6, and for which the amount net of applicable discounts described in appendix B of this part would be sufficient to meet the requirements of § 624.3.

      § 624.8   Initial margin models and standardized amounts.

#### § § 624.8

      (a)  Unless a covered swap entity's initial margin model conforms to the requirements of this section, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 624.3 on a daily basis pursuant to appendix A of this part.

      (b)  A covered swap entity may calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 624.3 on a daily basis using an initial margin model only if the initial margin model meets the requirements of this section.

      (c)  (1) A covered swap entity must obtain the prior written approval of the FCA before using any initial margin model to calculate the initial margin required in this part.

      (2) A covered swap entity must demonstrate that the initial margin model satisfies all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis.

      (3) A covered swap entity must notify the FCA in writing 60 days prior to:

      (i) Extending the use of an initial margin model that the FCA has approved under this section to an additional product type;

      (ii) Making any change to any initial margin model approved by the FCA under this section that would result in a material change in the covered swap entity's assessment of initial margin requirements; or

      (iii) Making any material change to modeling assumptions used by the initial margin model.

      (4) The FCA may rescind its approval of the use of any initial margin model, in whole or in part, or may impose additional conditions or requirements if the FCA determines, in its sole discretion, that the initial margin model no longer complies with this section.

      (d)  (1) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must calculate an amount of initial margin that is equal to the potential future exposure of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. Potential future exposure is an estimate of the one-tailed 99 percent confidence interval for an increase in the value of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps due to an instantaneous price shock that is equivalent to a movement in all material underlying risk factors, including prices, rates, and spreads, over a holding period equal to the shorter of ten business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio.

      (2) All data used to calibrate the initial margin model must be based on an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year and not more than five years and must incorporate a period of significant financial stress for each broad asset class that is appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.

      (3) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must use risk factors sufficient to measure all material price risks inherent in the transactions for which initial margin is being calculated. The risk categories must include, but should not be limited to, foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. For material exposures in significant currencies and markets, modeling techniques must capture spread and basis risk and must incorporate a sufficient number of segments of the yield curve to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.

      (4) In the case of a non-cleared cross-currency swap, the covered swap entity's initial margin model need not recognize any risks or risk factors associated with the fixed, physically-settled foreign exchange transaction associated with the exchange of principal embedded in the non-cleared cross-currency swap. The initial margin model must recognize all material risks and risk factors associated with all other payments and cash flows that occur during the life of the non-cleared cross-currency swap.

      (5) The initial margin model may calculate initial margin for a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap or a netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. It may reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and other hedging benefits for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that are governed by the same eligible master netting agreement by incorporating empirical correlations within the following broad risk categories, provided the covered swap entity validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for modeling and measuring hedging benefits: Commodity, credit, equity, and foreign exchange or interest rate. Empirical correlations under an eligible master netting agreement may be recognized by the initial margin model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.

      (6) If the initial margin model does not explicitly reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and hedging benefits between subsets of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category, the covered swap entity must calculate an amount of initial margin separately for each subset within which such relationships are explicitly recognized by the initial margin model. The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each subset of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty for the portfolio of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within the broad risk category.

      (7) The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty.

      (8) The initial margin model may not permit the calculation of any initial margin collection amount to be offset by, or otherwise take into account, any initial margin that may be owed or otherwise payable by the covered swap entity to the counterparty.

      (9) The initial margin model must include all material risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of option positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.

      (10) The covered swap entity may not omit any risk factor from the calculation of its initial margin that the covered swap entity uses in its initial margin model unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FCA that such omission is appropriate.

      (11) The covered swap entity may not incorporate any proxy or approximation used to capture the risks of the covered swap entity's non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FCA that such proxy or approximation is appropriate.

      (12) The covered swap entity must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal margin model to ensure continued applicability and relevance.

      (13) The covered swap entity must review and, as necessary, revise the data used to calibrate the initial margin model at least annually, and more frequently as market conditions warrant, to ensure that the data incorporate a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.

      (14) The level of sophistication of the initial margin model must be commensurate with the complexity of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it is applied. In calculating an initial margin collection amount, the initial margin model may make use of any of the generally accepted approaches for modeling the risk of a single instrument or portfolio of instruments.

      (15) The FCA may in its sole discretion require a covered swap entity using an initial margin model to collect a greater amount of initial margin than that determined by the covered swap entity's initial margin model if the FCA determines that the additional collateral is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the covered swap entity's transaction(s), or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction(s).

      (e)  A covered swap entity must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its initial margin model in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance the initial margin model as appropriate to ensure that the initial margin model continues to meet the requirements for approval in this section.

      (f)  (1) The covered swap entity must maintain a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.

      (2) The covered swap entity's risk control unit must validate its initial margin model prior to implementation and on an ongoing basis. The covered swap entity's validation process must be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the initial margin model, or the validation process must be subject to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. The validation process must include:

      (i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the initial margin model;

      (ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking by comparing the covered swap entity's initial margin model outputs (estimation of initial margin) with relevant alternative internal and external data sources or estimation techniques. The benchmark(s) must address the chosen model's limitations. When applicable, the covered swap entity should consider benchmarks that allow for non-normal distributions such as historical and Monte Carlo simulations. When applicable, validation shall include benchmarking against observable margin standards to ensure that the initial margin required is not less than what a derivatives clearing organization or a clearing agency would require for similar cleared transactions; and

      (iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting the initial margin model. This analysis must recognize and compensate for the challenges inherent in back-testing over periods that do not contain significant financial stress.

      (3) If the validation process reveals any material problems with the initial margin model, the covered swap entity must promptly notify the FCA of the problems, describe to the FCA any remedial actions being taken, and adjust the initial margin model to ensure an appropriately conservative amount of required initial margin is being calculated.

      (4) The covered swap entity must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management and the risk control unit that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the covered swap entity's initial margin model measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the covered swap entity's initial margin requirements under this part. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the covered swap entity's board of directors or a committee thereof.

      (g)  The covered swap entity must adequately document all material aspects of its initial margin model, including the management and valuation of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it applies, the control, oversight, and validation of the initial margin model, any review processes and the results of such processes.

      (h)  The covered swap entity must adequately document internal authorization procedures, including escalation procedures, that require review and approval of any change to the initial margin calculation under the initial margin model, demonstrable analysis that any basis for any such change is consistent with the requirements of this section, and independent review of such demonstrable analysis and approval.

      § 624.9   Cross-border application of margin requirements.

#### § § 624.9

      (a)  The requirements of §§ 624.3 through 624.8 and §§ 624.10 through 624.12 shall not apply to any foreign non-cleared swap or foreign non-cleared security-based swap of a foreign covered swap entity.

      (b) For purposes of this section, a  or  is any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with respect to which neither the counterparty to the foreign covered swap entity nor any party that provides a guarantee of either party's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is:

      (1) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (including a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States;

      (2) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State; or

      (3) A swap entity that is a subsidiary of an entity that is organized under the laws of the United States or any State.

      (c) For purposes of this section, a  is any covered swap entity that is not:

      (2) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State; or

      (3) An entity that is a subsidiary of an entity that is organized under the laws of the United States or any State.

      (d) —(1)  For non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into by covered swap entities described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a covered swap entity may satisfy the provisions of this part by complying with the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that the prudential regulators jointly, conditionally or unconditionally, determine by public order satisfy the corresponding requirements of §§ 624.3 through 624.8 and §§ 624.10 through 624.12.

      (2)  In determining whether to make a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the prudential regulators will consider whether the requirements of such foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps applicable to such covered swap entities are comparable to the otherwise applicable requirements of this part and appropriate for the safe and sound operation of the covered swap entity, taking into account the risks associated with non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps.

      (3)  A covered swap entity may rely on a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if:

      (i) The covered swap entity's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

      (A) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (other than a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States; or

      (B) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State; and

      (ii) The covered swap entity is:

      (A) A foreign covered swap entity;

      (B) A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank; or

      (C) An entity that is not organized under the laws of the United States or any State and is a subsidiary of a depository institution, Edge corporation, or agreement corporation.

      (4)  A covered swap entity satisfies its requirement to post initial margin under § 624.3(b) by posting to its counterparty initial margin in the form and amount, and at such times, that its counterparty is required to collect pursuant to a foreign regulatory framework, provided that the counterparty is subject to the foreign regulatory framework and the prudential regulators have made a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless otherwise stated in that determination, and the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

      (i) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (including a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States; or

      (ii) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State.

      (e)  (1) A covered swap entity described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may request that the prudential regulators make a determination pursuant to this section. A request for a determination must include a description of:

      (i) The scope and objectives of the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps;

      (ii) The specific provisions of the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that govern:

      (A) The scope of transactions covered;

      (B) The determination of the amount of initial margin and variation margin required and how that amount is calculated;

      (C) The timing of margin requirements;

      (D) Any documentation requirements;

      (E) The forms of eligible collateral;

      (F) Any segregation and rehypothecation requirements; and

      (G) The approval process and standards for models used in calculating initial margin and variation margin;

      (iii) The supervisory compliance program and enforcement authority exercised by a foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities in such system to support its oversight of the application of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap regulatory framework and how that framework applies to the non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps of the covered swap entity; and

      (iv) Any other descriptions and documentation that the prudential regulators determine are appropriate.

      (2) A covered swap entity described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may make a request under this section only if the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap activities of the covered swap entity are directly supervised by the authorities administering the foreign regulatory framework for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps.

      (f)  Sections 624.3(b) and 624.7 do not apply to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by:

      (1) A foreign branch of a covered swap entity that is a depository institution; or

      (2) A covered swap entity that is not organized under the laws of the United States or any State and is a subsidiary of a depository institution, Edge corporation, or agreement corporation, if:

      (i) Inherent limitations in the legal or operational infrastructure in the foreign jurisdiction make it impracticable for the covered swap entity and the counterparty to post any form of eligible initial margin collateral recognized pursuant to § 624.6(b) in compliance with the segregation requirements of § 624.7;

      (ii) The covered swap entity is subject to foreign regulatory restrictions that require the covered swap entity to transact in the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with the counterparty through an establishment within the foreign jurisdiction and do not accommodate the posting of collateral for the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap outside the jurisdiction;

      (iii) The counterparty to the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is not, and the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap do not have a guarantee from:

      (A) An entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State (including a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank) or a natural person who is a resident of the United States; or

      (B) A branch or office of an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State;

      (iv) The covered swap entity collects initial margin for the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap in accordance with § 624.3(a) in the form of cash pursuant to § 624.6(b)(1), and posts and collects variation margin in accordance with § 624.4(a) in the form of cash pursuant to § 624.6(b)(1); and

      (v) The FCA provides the covered swap entity with prior written approval for the covered swap entity's reliance on this paragraph (f) for the foreign jurisdiction.

      (g)  means an arrangement pursuant to which one party to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap has rights of recourse against a third-party guarantor, with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. For these purposes, a party to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap has rights of recourse against a guarantor if the party has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from the guarantor with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. In addition, any arrangement pursuant to which the guarantor has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from any other third party guarantor with respect to the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap, such arrangement will be deemed a guarantee of the counterparty's obligations under the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap by the other guarantor.

      (h)(1) A covered swap entity described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section is not subject to the requirements of § 624.3(a) or § 624.11(a) for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap executed with an affiliate of the covered swap entity; and

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, “affiliate” has the same meaning provided in § 624.11(d).

      § 624.11   Special rules for affiliates.

#### § § 624.11

      (a)(1) A covered swap entity shall calculate on each business day an initial margin collection amount for each counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity.

      (2) If the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not exceed 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital, the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) do not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.

      (3) On each business day that the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital:

      (i) The covered swap entity shall collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) for each additional non-cleared swap and non-cleared security-based swap executed that business day with a counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity, commencing on the day after execution and continuing on a daily basis as required under § 624.3(c), until the earlier of;

      (A) The termination date of such non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap, or

      (B) The business day on which the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section falls below 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital;

      (ii) Notwithstanding § 624.7(b), to the extent the covered swap entity collects initial margin pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section in the form of collateral other than cash collateral, the custodian for such collateral may be the covered swap entity or an affiliate of the covered swap entity; and

      (4) For purposes of this paragraph (a), “tier 1 capital” means:

      (i) For Farm Credit System banks and associations, the sum of common equity tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 628.20(b) and additional tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 628.20(c), and as reported in the institution's most recent Uniform Reports of Financial Condition and Performance (Call Report); or

      (ii) For the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, as defined and required in in 12 CFR 652.61, and as reported in the institution's most recent Call Report.

      (5) If any subsidiary of the covered swap entity (including a subsidiary described in § 624.9(h)) executes any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with any counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity:

      (i) The covered swap entity shall treat such non-cleared swap or security-based swap as its own for purposes of this paragraph (a); and

      (ii) If the subsidiary is itself a covered swap entity, the compliance by its parent covered swap entity with this paragraph (a)(5) shall be deemed to establish the subsidiary's compliance with the requirements of § 624.11(a) and to exempt the subsidiary from the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) from an affiliate.

      (b) The requirement for a covered swap entity to post initial margin under § 624.3(b) does not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.

      (c) Section 624.3(d) shall apply to a counterparty that is an affiliate in the same manner as it applies to any counterparty that is neither a financial end user without a material swap exposure nor a swap entity.

      (d) For purposes of this section:

      (1) An  means:

      (i) An affiliate as defined in § 624.2; or

      (ii) Any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the covered swap entity through the direct or indirect exercise of controlling influence over the management or policies of the controlled company.

      (2) A  means:

      (i) A subsidiary as defined in § 624.2; or

      (ii) Any company that is controlled by the covered swap entity through the direct or indirect exercise of controlling influence over the management or policies of the controlled company.

### Part 625

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 504, 12 U.S.C. 2252.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 60109, Dec. 18, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 625.1   Purpose.

#### § § 625.1

        These rules implement the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (EAJA). The EAJA provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (designated by the EAJA as “adversary adjudications”) before Federal agencies. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part explain how the EAJA applies to Farm Credit Administration (FCA) proceedings. The rules describe the parties eligible for awards, how such parties may apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that govern FCA consideration of applications.

        § 625.2   Proceedings covered.

#### § § 625.2

        (a) The EAJA applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the FCA either on its own behalf or in connection with any other agency of the United States that participates in or in any way is a part of the adversary adjudication. Adversary adjudications are:

        (1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the FCA or other agency is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding; and

        (2) Enforcement proceedings under 12 U.S.C. 2261-2273.

        (b) The failure of the FCA to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes that the proceeding is covered by the EAJA; whether the proceeding is covered shall then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.

        (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered and excluded from coverage by the EAJA, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

        (d) Proceedings under this part may be conducted by the FCA Board (Board) or by the presiding officer (referred to as the “adjudicative officer” in the EAJA), as defined in § 622.2(f) of this chapter. If the Board conducts proceedings, reference to the “presiding officer” in this part shall mean the Board, in applicable context. Where the Board presides, the recommended decision under § 625.26 of this part will be omitted and the Board will make a final decision on the application in accordance with § 625.27 of this part.

        (e) If a court reviews the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication, an award for fees and other expenses may be made only pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(3).

        § 625.3   Eligibility of applicants.

#### § § 625.3

        (a) To be eligible for an award under the EAJA, an applicant must be a prevailing party named or admitted to the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B of this part.

        (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:

        (1) An individual with a net worth of $2 million or less;

        (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has both a net worth of $7 million or less (including personal and business interests), and 500 or fewer employees;

        (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with 500 or fewer employees;

        (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with 500 or fewer employees; and

        (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of $7 million or less and 500 or fewer employees.

        (c) For eligibility purposes, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adversary adjudication was initiated.

        (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.

        (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for that applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.

        (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility unless the presiding officer determines that aggregation would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities.

        (1) For purposes of this part, an affiliate is:

        (i) Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interests of the applicant; or

        (ii) Any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interests.

        (2) The presiding officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

        (g) An applicant that participates in an adversary adjudication primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

        § 625.4   Standards for awards.

#### § § 625.4

        (a) If an eligible applicant prevails over the FCA in an adversary adjudication, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion thereof, the applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in the adjudication, or portion thereof, unless the position of the FCA over which the applicant prevailed was substantially justified.

        (b) The position of the FCA includes:

        (1) The position taken by the FCA in the adversary adjudication; and

        (2) The action or inaction of the FCA upon which the adversary adjudication is based.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the FCA must prove that its position was substantially justified before an award may be denied to an otherwise eligible applicant.

        (d) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.

        § 625.5   Allowable fees and expenses.

#### § § 625.5

        (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.

        (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the FCA pays expert witnesses. However, an award also may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or expert witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.

        (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the presiding officer shall consider the following:

        (1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fees for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated costs of the services;

        (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs services;

        (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

        (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudication; and

        (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.

        (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, audit, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for the preparation of the applicant's case.

        § 625.6   Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

#### § § 625.6

        (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the FCA may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The FCA will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.

        (b) Any person may file with the FCA a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the FCA should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The FCA will respond to the petition within 90 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

        § 625.7   Awards against other agencies.

#### § § 625.7

        If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in or in any way is a part of an adversary adjudication before the FCA and that agency's position is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.

      Subpart B—Applicant Information Required

        § 625.10   Contents of application.

#### § § 625.10

        (a) An application for an award of fees and other expenses under the EAJA shall identify the applicant and the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed in the adversary adjudication. If the application is made on the basis of significant and discrete substantive issues on which the applicant prevailed, the issues must be specifically identified. The application also shall identify each position of the FCA or other agencies that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business and state the number of persons employed.

        (b) The application shall include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:

        (1) It states that it has 500 employees or fewer and attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or

        (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with 500 or fewer employees.

        (c) The application shall state the total amount of fees and other expenses for which an award is sought.

        (d) The application may include any other relevant matters that the applicant wishes the FCA to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.

        (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. The application must contain a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application and any supporting documents is accurate.

        § 625.11   Net worth exhibit.

#### § § 625.11

        (a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 625.3(f)(1) of this part) as of the date when the adversary adjudication was initiated. The exhibit may be in any convenient form that provides full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of the applicant and its affiliates and is otherwise sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The presiding officer may require an applicant to file additional information supporting its eligibility for an award.

        (b) An applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the net worth exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the presiding officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion under § 622.11 of this chapter to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the FCA, but need not be served on any other party to the application proceeding. If the presiding officer, or the FCA Board pursuant to § 622.11(e) of this chapter, finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the application proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be treated in accordance with the FCA's procedures regarding release of information (12 CFR part 602).

        § 625.12   Documentation of fees and expenses.

#### § § 625.12

        The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, audit, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rates at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. Under § 625.25 of this part, the presiding officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, logs, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses claimed.

        § 625.13   When an application may be filed.

#### § § 625.13

        (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the adversary adjudication, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion thereof, but in no case later than 30 days after the FCA's final disposition of the adversary adjudication.

        (b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the adversary adjudication is issued or any other complete resolution of the adversary adjudication, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and is unreviewable by the FCA, any other administrative body, or the courts.

        (c) If review, reconsideration, or appeal is sought or taken of an adversary adjudication decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, application proceedings for any award of fees and other expenses shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.

If a prevailing party and the FCA counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award, the proposed settlement must be submitted to the presiding officer for a recommended decision pursuant to § 625.26 of this part. If it has not been previously filed, the application must be submitted to the presiding officer along with the proposed settlement.

        § 625.21   Filing and service of documents.

#### § § 625.21

        Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the adversary adjudication in the same manner as other pleadings in the adversary adjudication ( §§ 622.18 and 622.19 of this chapter), except as provided in § 625.11(b) of this part for confidential financial information.

        (b) The answer shall set forth any objections to the requested award and identify the facts relied on in support of the FCA's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adversary adjudication, the FCA counsel shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 625.25 of this part.

        (c) If the FCA counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon request by the FCA counsel and the applicant.

        § 625.23   Reply.

#### § § 625.23

        § 625.25   Further proceedings.

#### § § 625.25

        (a) The determination of an award shall be made on the basis of the written record unless the presiding officer finds that further proceedings are necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application. Such further proceedings may be at the request of either the applicant or the FCA counsel, or on the presiding officer's own initiative, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Further proceedings may include an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or other actions required by the presiding officer, but may not include discovery or an evidentiary hearing with respect to the issue of whether the agency's position was substantially justified.

        (b) Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.

        (c) A request that the presiding officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the FCA's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

        § 625.27   Board decision.

        § 628.1   Purpose, applicability, and reservations of authority.

#### § § 628.1

        (a)  This part establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for System institutions. This part includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part.

        (b)  Nothing in this part limits the authority of FCA to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation under part C of title V of the Farm Credit Act.

        (c)  Subject to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section:

        (1)  Each System institution must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.

        (2)  Each System institution must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.

        (3)  (i) Each System institution must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part to calculate total risk-weighted assets.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (4)  (i) All System banks must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.

        (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]

        (d) —(1)  FCA may require a System institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if FCA determines that the System institution's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the System institution's credit, market, operational, or other risks according to part 615, subparts L and M, of this chapter.

        (2)  (i) If FCA determines that a particular common equity tier 1 (CET1), additional tier 1 (AT1), or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its permanence or its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, FCA may require the System institution to exclude all or a portion of such element from CET1 capital, AT1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments set forth in subpart C of this part, FCA may find that a capital element may be included in a System institution's CET1 capital, AT1 capital, or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with § 628.20(e).

        (3)  If FCA determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the System institution for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, FCA may require the System institution to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.

        (4)  If FCA determines that the leverage exposure amount, or the amount reflected in the System institution's reported average total consolidated assets, for a balance sheet exposure calculated by a System institution under § 628.10 is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the System institution, FCA may require the System institution to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.

        (5) [Reserved]

        (6)  With respect to any deduction or limitation required under this part, FCA may require a different deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the System institution's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.

        (e)  In making a determination under this section, FCA will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner as the notice and response procedures in § 615.5352 of this chapter.

        (f) [Reserved]

        § 628.3   Operational requirements for certain exposures.

#### § § 628.3

        For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets under subpart D of this part:

        (a)  In order to recognize certain exposures as cleared transactions pursuant to paragraph (1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of the definition of “cleared transaction” in § 628.2, the exposures must meet all of the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a).

        (1) The offsetting transaction must be identified by the CCP as a transaction for the clearing member client.

        (2) The collateral supporting the transaction must be held in a manner that prevents the System institution from facing any loss due to an event of default, including from a liquidation, receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding of either the clearing member or the clearing member's other clients. Omnibus accounts established under 17 CFR parts 190 and 300 satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a).

        (3) The System institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from a default or receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions.

        (4) The offsetting transaction with a clearing member must be transferable under the transaction documents and applicable laws in the relevant jurisdiction(s) to another clearing member should the clearing member default, become insolvent, or enter receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceedings.

        (b)  In order to recognize an exposure as an eligible margin loan as defined in § 628.2, a System institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:

        (1) Meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of “eligible margin loan” in § 628.2; and

        (2) Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.

        (c) [Reserved]

        (d)  In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying master netting agreement as defined in § 628.2, a System institution must:

        (1) Conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that:

        (i) The agreement meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of the definition of “qualifying master netting agreement” in § 628.2; and

        (ii) In the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; and

        (2) Establish and maintain written procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the agreement continues to satisfy the requirements of the definition of “qualifying master netting agreement” in § 628.2.

        (e)  In order to recognize an exposure as a repo-style transaction as defined in § 628.2, a System institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:

        (1) Meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of the definition of “repo-style transaction” in § 628.2, and

        (2) Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.

        (f)  If a System institution determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)(i) through (iii) of the definition of a “QCCP” in § 628.2, the System institution may continue to treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to 3 months following the determination. If the CCP fails to remedy the relevant deficiency within 3 months after the initial determination, or the CCP fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)(i) through (iii) of the definition of a QCCP continuously for a 3-month period after remedying the relevant deficiency, a System institution may not treat the CCP as a QCCP for the purposes of this part until after the System institution has determined that the CCP has satisfied the requirements in paragraph (2)(i) through (iii) of the definition of a QCCP for 3 continuous months.

        (ii) To calculate the measure of URE and URE equivalents described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a System institution must adjust URE and URE equivalents to reflect all the deductions and adjustments required under § 628.22(a), (b), and (c), and must use the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio.

        (5)  A System institution's permanent capital ratio is the ratio of the institution's permanent capital to its total risk-adjusted asset base as reported on the institution's Call Report, calculated in accordance with the regulations in part 615, subpart H, of this chapter.

        (d) [Reserved]

        (e)  (1) Notwithstanding the minimum requirements in this part, a System institution must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the System institution is exposed. FCA may evaluate a System institution's capital adequacy and require the institution to maintain higher minimum regulatory capital ratios using the factors listed in § 615.5350 of this chapter.

        (2) A System institution must have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital under § 615.5200 of this chapter.

        (iii) The instrument has no maturity date, can be redeemed only at the discretion of the System institution and with the prior approval of FCA, and does not contain any term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem;

        (iv) The System institution did not create, through any action or communication, an expectation that it will buy back, cancel, redeem, or revolve the instrument, and the instrument does not include any term or feature that might give rise to such an expectation, except that the establishment of a revolvement period of 7 years or more, or the practice of redeeming or revolving the instrument no less than 7 years after issuance or allocation, will not be considered to create such an expectation;

        (v) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the System institution's net income or unallocated retained earnings, and are not subject to a limit imposed by the contractual terms governing the instrument;

        (vi) The System institution has full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of any other restrictions on the System institution;

        (vii) Dividend payments and other distributions related to the instrument may be paid only after all legal and contractual obligations of the System institution have been satisfied, including payments due on more senior claims;

        (viii) The holders of the instrument bear losses as they occur before any losses are borne by holders of preferred stock claims on the System institution and holders of any other claims with priority over common cooperative equity instruments in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

        (ix) The instrument is classified as equity under GAAP;

        (x) The System institution, or an entity that the System institution controls, did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument, except that where there is an obligation for a member of the institution to hold an instrument in order to receive a loan or service from the System institution, an amount of that loan equal to no more than $1,000 of the borrower stock requirement under section 4.3A of the Act will not be considered as a direct or indirect funding where:

        (A) The purpose of the loan is not the purchase of capital instruments of the System institution providing the loan; and

        (B) The purchase or acquisition of one or more member equities of the institution is necessary in order for the beneficiary of the loan to become a member of the System institution;

        (xi) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the System institution, and is not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument;

        (xii) The instrument is issued in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with the institution's capitalization bylaws;

        (xiii) The instrument is reported on the System institution's regulatory financial statements separately from other capital instruments; and

        (xiv) The System institution's capitalization bylaws, or a resolution adopted by its board of directors under § 628.21, provides that the institution:

        (A) Establishes a minimum redemption or revolvement period of 7 years for equities included in CET1; and

        (B) Shall not redeem, revolve, cancel, or remove any equities included in CET1 without prior approval of the FCA under paragraph (f) of this section, except that the statutory borrower stock described in paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this section, not to exceed $1,000, may be redeemed without a minimum period outstanding after issuance and without the prior approval of the FCA, as long as after the redemption, the System institution continues to comply with all minimum regulatory capital requirements.

        (iv) The instrument has no maturity date and does not contain a dividend step-up or any other term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem;

        (v) If callable by its terms, the instrument may be called by the System institution only after a minimum of 5 years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called earlier than 5 years upon the occurrence of a regulatory event that precludes the instrument from being included in AT1 capital, or a tax event. In addition:

        (A) The System institution must receive prior approval from FCA to exercise a call option on the instrument.

        (B) The System institution does not create at issuance of the instrument, through any action or communication, an expectation that the call option will be exercised.

        (C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the System institution must either replace the instrument to be called with an equal amount of instruments that meet the criteria under paragraph (b) of this section or this paragraph (c),  or demonstrate to the satisfaction of FCA that following redemption, the System institution will continue to hold capital commensurate with its risk;

        (vi) Redemption or repurchase of the instrument requires prior approval from FCA;

        (vii) The System institution has full discretion at all times to cancel dividends or other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of other restrictions on the System institution except in relation to any distributions to holders of common cooperative equity instruments or other instruments that are pari passu with the instrument;

        (viii) Any distributions on the instrument are paid out of the System institution's net income, unallocated retained earnings, or surplus related to other AT1 capital instruments;

        (ix) The instrument does not have a credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the System institution's credit quality, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the System institution's credit quality, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments;

        (x) The paid-in amount is classified as equity under GAAP;

        (xi) The System institution did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument;

        (xii) The instrument does not have any features that would limit or discourage additional issuance of capital by the System institution, such as provisions that require the System institution to compensate holders of the instrument if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a specified timeframe; and

        (xiii) [Reserved]

        (xiv) The System institution's capitalization bylaws, or a resolution adopted by its board of directors under § 628.21, provides that the institution:

        (A) Establishes a minimum redemption or no-call period of 5 years for equities included in additional tier 1; and

        (B) Shall not redeem, revolve, cancel, or remove any equities included in additional tier 1 capital without prior approval of the FCA under paragraph (f) of this section.

        (2)-(3) [Reserved]

        (i) [Reserved]

        (ii) An instrument with terms that provide that the instrument may be called earlier than 5 years upon the occurrence of a rating agency event does not violate the criterion in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section provided that the instrument was issued and included in a System institution's core surplus capital prior to January 1, 2017, and that such instrument satisfies all other criteria under this § 628.20(c).

        (d)  Tier 2 capital is the sum of tier 2 capital elements and any related surplus minus regulatory adjustments and deductions in §§ 628.22 and 628.23. Tier 2 capital elements are:

        (iv) The instrument has a minimum original maturity of at least 5 years. At the beginning of each of the last 5 years of the life of the instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included in tier 2 capital is reduced by 20 percent of the original amount of the instrument (net of redemptions) and is excluded from regulatory capital when the remaining maturity is less than 1 year. In addition, the instrument must not have any terms or features that require, or create significant incentives for, the System institution to redeem the instrument prior to maturity;

        (v) The instrument, by its terms, may be called by the System institution only after a minimum of 5 years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called sooner upon the occurrence of an event that would preclude the instrument from being included in tier 2 capital, or a tax event. In addition:

        (A) The System institution must receive the prior approval of FCA to exercise a call option on the instrument.

        (B) The System institution does not create at issuance, through action or communication, an expectation the call option will be exercised.

        (C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the System institution must either: replace any amount called with an equivalent amount of an instrument that meets the criteria for regulatory capital under this section;   or demonstrate to the satisfaction of FCA that following redemption, the System institution would continue to hold an amount of capital that is commensurate with its risk;

        (vi) The holder of the instrument must have no contractual right to accelerate payment of principal, dividends, or interest on the instrument, except in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the System institution;

        (vii) The instrument has no credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend or interest rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the System institution's credit standing, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the System institution's credit standing, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments;

        (viii) The System institution has not purchased and has not directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument, except that where common cooperative equity instruments are held by a member of the institution in connection with a loan, and the institution funds the acquisition of such instruments, that loan shall not be considered as a direct or indirect funding where:

        (A) The purpose of the loan is not the purchase of capital instruments of the System institution providing the loan;

        (B) The purchase or acquisition of one or more capital instruments of the institution is necessary in order for the beneficiary of the loan to become a member of the System institution; and

        (C) The capital instruments are in excess of $1,000.

        (ix) [Reserved]

        (x) Redemption of the instrument prior to maturity or repurchase is at the discretion of the System institution and requires the prior approval of the FCA;

        (xi) The System institution's capitalization bylaws, or a resolution adopted by its board of directors under § 628.21, provides that the institution:

        (A) Establishes a minimum call, redemption or revolvement period of 5 years for equities included in tier 2 capital; and

        (B) Shall not call, redeem, revolve, cancel, or remove any equities included in tier 2 capital without prior approval of the FCA under paragraph (f) of this section.

        (4)-(6) [Reserved]

        (e)  (1) A System institution must receive FCA prior approval to include a capital element (as listed in this section) in its CET1 capital, AT1 capital, or tier 2 capital unless the element is equivalent, in terms of capital quality and ability to absorb losses with respect to all material terms, to a regulatory capital element FCA determined may be included in regulatory capital pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (i)-(ii) [Reserved]

        (2) [Reserved]

        (3) After determining that a regulatory capital element may be included in a System institution's CET1 capital, AT1 capital, or tier 2 capital, FCA will make its decision publicly available.

        (f)  (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (6) of this section, a System institution must obtain the prior approval of the FCA before paying cash dividend payments, cash patronage payments, or redeeming equities included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital, other than term equities redeemed on their maturity date.

        (2) At least 30 days prior to the intended action, the System institution must submit a request for approval to the FCA. The FCA's 30-day review period begins on the date on which the FCA receives the request.

        (3) The request is deemed to be granted if the FCA does not notify the System institution to the contrary before the end of the 30-day review period.

        (4)(i) A System institution may request advance approval to cover several anticipated cash dividend or patronage payments, or equity redemptions, provided that the institution projects sufficient current net income during those periods to support the amount of the cash dividend or patronage payments and equity redemptions. In determining whether to grant advance approval, the FCA will consider:

        (A) The reasonableness of the institution's request, including its historical and projected cash dividend and patronage payments and equity redemptions;

        (B) The institution's historical trends and current projections for capital growth through earnings retention;

        (C) The overall condition of the institution, with particular emphasis on current and projected capital adequacy as described in § 628.10(e); and

        (D) Any other information that the FCA deems pertinent to reviewing the institution's request.

        (ii) After considering these standards, the FCA may grant advance prior approval of an institution's request to pay cash dividends and patronage or to redeem or revolve equity. Notwithstanding any such approval, an institution may not declare a dividend or patronage payment or redeem or revolve equities if, after such declaration, redemption, or revolvement, the institution would not meet its regulatory capital requirements set forth in this part and part 615 of this chapter.

        (5) Subject to any capital distribution restrictions specified in § 628.11, a System institution is deemed to have FCA prior approval for revolvements and redemptions of common cooperative equities, for cash dividend payments on all equities, and for cash patronage payments on all cooperative equities, provided that:

        (i) For redemptions or revolvements of common cooperative equities included in CET1 capital or tier 2 capital, other than as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, the institution issued or allocated such equities at least 7 years ago for CET1 capital and at least 5 years ago for tier 2 capital;

        (ii) After such cash payments have been declared and defined by resolution of the board, the dollar amount of the System institution's CET1 capital at quarter-end equals or exceeds the dollar amount of CET1 capital on the same quarter-end in the previous calendar year; and

        (iii) The System institution continues to comply with all regulatory capital requirements and supervisory or enforcement actions.

        (6) The following equities are eligible to be redeemed or revolved under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section in less than the applicable minimum required holding period (7 years for CET1 inclusion and 5 years for tier 2 inclusion), provided that the requirements of paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section are met:

        (i) Equities mandated to be redeemed or retired by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction;

        (ii) Equities held by the estate of a deceased former borrower; and

        (iii) Equities that the institution is required to cancel under § 615.5290 of this chapter in connection with a restructuring under part 617 of this chapter.

        (2) a minimum no-call, repurchase, or redemption period of 5 years for additional tier 1 capital; and

        (3) a minimum no-call, repurchase, redemption, or revolvement period of 5 years for tier 2 capital.

        (c) The institution shall submit to FCA a written request for prior approval before:

        (1) Redesignating URE equivalents as equities that the institution may exercise its discretion to redeem other than upon dissolution or liquidation;

        (2) Removing equities or other instruments from CET1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital other than through repurchase, cancellation, redemption or revolvement; and

        (3) Redesignating equities included in one component of regulatory capital (CET1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital) for inclusion in another component of regulatory capital.

        (d) The institution shall not exercise its discretion to revolve URE equivalents except upon dissolution or liquidation and shall not offset URE equivalents against a loan in default except as required under final order of a court of competent jurisdiction or if required under § 615.5290 in connection with a restructuring under part 617 of this chapter.

        (e) The minimum redemption and revolvement period (holding period) for purchased and allocated equities starts on the common cooperative equity issuance date, as defined in § 628.2.

        § 628.22   Regulatory capital adjustments and deductions.

#### § § 628.22

        (a)  A System institution must deduct from the sum of its CET1 capital elements the items set forth in this paragraph (a):

        (1) Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

        (2) Intangible assets, other than mortgage servicing assets (MSAs), net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

        (3) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

        (4) Any gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure;

        (5) Any defined benefit pension fund net asset, net of any associated DTL in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, except that, with FCA prior approval, this deduction is not required for any defined benefit pension fund net asset to the extent the institution has unrestricted and unfettered access to the assets in that fund;

        (6) The System institution's allocated equity investment in another System institution or service corporation; and

        (7) [Reserved]

        (8) If, without the required prior FCA approval, the System institution redeems or revolves purchased or allocated equities included in its CET1 capital that have been outstanding for less than 7 years, the FCA may take appropriate supervisory or enforcement actions against the institution, which may include requiring the institution to deduct a portion of its purchased and allocated equities from CET1 capital.

        (b)  (1) Any accrual of a patronage or dividend payable or receivable recognized in the financial statements prior to a related board declaration or resolution must be reversed to or from unallocated retained earnings for purposes of calculating CET1 capital.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (2) . For purposes of subpart C of this part, the corresponding deduction approach is the methodology used for the deductions from regulatory capital related to purchased equity investments in another System institution (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section). Under the corresponding deduction approach, a System institution must make deductions from the component of capital for which the underlying instrument would qualify if it were issued by the System institution itself. If the System institution does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must be deducted according to paragraph (f) of this section.

        (i)-(iii) [Reserved]

        (3)-(4) [Reserved]

        (5)  System institutions must deduct all purchased equity investments in another System institution, service corporation, or the Funding Corporation by applying the corresponding deduction approach. The deductions described in this section are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. With prior written approval of FCA, for the period stipulated by FCA, a System institution is not required to deduct an investment in the capital of another institution in distress if such investment is made to provide financial support to the System institution as determined by FCA.

        (d) [Reserved]

        (e)  (1) The netting of DTLs against assets that are subject to deduction under this section is required, if the following conditions are met:

        (i) The DTL is associated with the asset; and

        (ii) The DTL would be extinguished if the associated asset becomes impaired or is derecognized under GAAP.

        (2) A DTL may only be netted against a single asset.

        (3)-(4) [Reserved]

        (5) A System institution must net DTLs against assets subject to deduction under this section in a consistent manner from reporting period to reporting period.

        (f)  Under the corresponding deduction approach, if a System institution does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the required deduction after completing the deductions required under paragraph (c) of this section, the System institution must deduct the shortfall from the next higher (that is, more subordinated) component of regulatory capital.

        (g)  A System institution must exclude from total risk-weighted assets any item deducted from regulatory capital under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.

        (a) The then existing limit, if any; or

        (b) The lesser of:

        (1) Forty percent of total capital, calculated by taking two thirds of the average of the previous 4 quarters of total capital reported on the institution's Call Report filed with the FCA, less any amounts of third-party capital reported in total capital; or

        (2) The average of the previous 4 quarters of CET1 capital reported on its Call Report filed with the FCA.

          § 628.31   Mechanics for calculating risk-weighted assets for general credit risk.

#### § § 628.31

          (a)  A System institution must apply risk weights to its exposures as follows:

          (1) A System institution must determine the exposure amount of each on-balance sheet exposure, each OTC derivative contract, and each off-balance sheet commitment, trade and transaction-related contingency, guarantee, repo-style transaction, financial standby letter of credit, forward agreement, or other similar transaction that is not:

          (i) An unsettled transaction subject to § 628.38;

          (ii) A cleared transaction subject to § 628.35;

          (iii) [Reserved]

          (iv) A securitization exposure subject to §§ 628.41 through 628.45; or

          (v) An equity exposure (other than an equity OTC derivative contract) subject to §§ 628.51 through 628.53.

          (2) The System institution must multiply each exposure amount by the risk weight appropriate to the exposure based on the exposure type or counterparty, eligible guarantor, or financial collateral to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure.

          (b) Total risk-weighted assets for general credit risk equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts calculated under this section.

          § 628.32   General risk weights.

#### § § 628.32

          (a) —(1)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirement in this subpart, a System institution must assign a 0-percent risk weight to:

          (A) An exposure to the U.S. Government, its central bank, or a U.S. Government agency; and

          (B) The portion of an exposure that is directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its central bank, or a U.S. Government agency. This includes a deposit or other exposure, or the portion of a deposit or other exposure that is insured or otherwise unconditionally guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration.

          (ii) A System institution must assign a 20-percent risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is conditionally guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its central bank, or a U.S. Government agency. This includes an exposure, or the portion of an exposure, that is conditionally guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration.

          (2)  In accordance with Table 1 to § 628.32, a System institution must assign a risk weight to a sovereign exposure based on the Country Risk Classification (CRC) applicable to the sovereign or the sovereign's Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) membership status if there is no CRC applicable to the sovereign.

          (3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a System institution may assign to a sovereign exposure a risk weight that is lower than the applicable risk weight in table 1 to § 628.32 if:

          (i) The exposure is denominated in the sovereign's currency;

          (ii) The System institution has at least an equivalent amount of liabilities in that currency; and

          (iii) The risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that the sovereign allows banking organizations under its jurisdiction to assign to the same exposures to the sovereign.

          (4)  Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (5), and (6) of this section, a System institution must assign a 100-percent risk weight to a sovereign exposure if the sovereign does not have a CRC.

          (5)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, a System institution must assign a 0-percent risk weight to an exposure to a sovereign that is a member of the OECD if the sovereign does not have a CRC.

          (6)  A System institution must assign a 150-percent risk weight to a sovereign exposure immediately upon determining that an event of sovereign default has occurred, or if an event of sovereign default has occurred during the previous 5 years.

          (b)  A System institution must assign a 0-percent risk weight to an exposure to the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, or an MDB.

          (c)  (1) A System institution must assign a 20-percent risk weight to an exposure to a GSE other than an equity exposure or preferred stock.

          (2) A System institution must assign a 100-percent risk weight to preferred stock issued by a non-System GSE.

          (3) Purchased equity investments (including preferred stock investments) in other System institutions do not receive a risk weight, because they are deducted from capital in accordance with § 628.22.

          (d) —(1)  A System institution must assign a 20-percent risk weight to an exposure to a depository institution or credit union that is organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d). This risk weight applies to an exposure a System bank has to another financing institution (OFI) that is a depository institution or credit union organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or is owned and controlled by such an entity that guarantees the exposure. If the OFI exposure does not satisfy these requirements, it must be assigned a risk weight as a corporate exposure pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) or (f)(2) of this section.

          (2)  (i) Except as otherwise provided under paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, a System institution must assign a risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank, in accordance with table 2 to § 628.32, based on the CRC rating that corresponds to the foreign bank's home country or the OECD membership status of the foreign bank's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the foreign bank's home country.

          (ii) A System institution must assign a 20-percent risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank whose home country is a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC.

          (iii) A System institution must assign a 100-percent risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank whose home country is not a member of the OECD and does not have a CRC, with the exception of self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods, and that have a maturity of 3 months or less, which may be assigned a 20-percent risk weight.

          (iv) A System institution must assign a 150-percent risk weight to an exposure to a foreign bank immediately upon determining that an event of sovereign default has occurred in the bank's home country, or if an event of sovereign default has occurred in the foreign bank's home country during the previous 5 years.

          (2)  (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, a System institution must assign a risk weight to a general obligation exposure to a foreign PSE, in accordance with Table 3 to § 628.32, based on the CRC that corresponds to the PSE's home country or the OECD membership status of the PSE's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the PSE's home country.

          (ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, a System institution must assign a risk weight to a revenue obligation exposure to a foreign PSE, in accordance with Table 4 to § 628.32, based on the CRC that corresponds to the PSE's home country; or the OECD membership status of the PSE's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the PSE's home country.

          (3) A System institution may assign a lower risk weight than would otherwise apply under tables 3 and 4 to § 628.32 to an exposure to a foreign PSE if:

          (i) The PSE's home country supervisor allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign a lower risk weight to such exposures; and

          (ii) The risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that corresponds to the PSE's home country in accordance with table 1 to § 628.32.

          (4)  (i) A System institution must assign a 20-percent risk weight to a general obligation exposure to a PSE whose home country is a OECD member sovereign with no CRC.

          (f) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a System institution must assign a 100-percent risk weight to all its corporate exposures. Assets assigned a risk weight under this provision include:

          (i) Borrower loans such as agricultural loans and consumer loans, regardless of the corporate form of the borrower, unless those loans qualify for different risk weights under other provisions of this subpart D;

          (ii) System bank exposures to OFIs that do not satisfy the requirements for a 20-percent risk weight pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section or a 50-percent risk weight pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and

          (iii) Premises, fixed assets, and other real estate owned.

          (2)  Unless the OFI satisfies the requirements for a 20-percent risk weight pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a System institution must assign a 50-percent risk weight to an exposure to an OFI that satisfies at least one of the following requirements:

          (i) The OFI is investment grade or is owned and controlled by an investment grade entity that guarantees the exposure; or

          (ii) The OFI meets capital, risk identification and control, and operational standards similar to the OFIs identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

          (2) A System institution must assign a 100-percent risk weight to a first-lien residential mortgage exposure that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and to junior-lien residential mortgage exposures.

          (3) For the purpose of this paragraph (g), if a System institution holds the first-lien and junior-lien(s) residential mortgage exposures, and no other party holds an intervening lien, the System institution must combine the exposures and treat them as a single first-lien residential mortgage exposure.

          (4) A loan modified or restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program is not modified or restructured for purposes of this section.

          (h)-(i) [Reserved]

          (k)  Except for a sovereign exposure or a residential mortgage exposure, a System institution must determine a risk weight for an exposure that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status according to the requirements set forth in this paragraph (k).

          (1) A System institution must assign a 150-percent risk weight to the portion of the exposure that is not guaranteed or that is not secured by financial collateral.

          (2) A System institution may assign a risk weight to the guaranteed portion of a past due or nonaccrual exposure based on the risk weight that applies under § 628.36 if the guarantee or credit derivative meets the requirements of that section.

          (3) A System institution may assign a risk weight to the portion of a past due or nonaccrual exposure that is collateralized by financial collateral based on the risk weight that applies under § 628.37 if the financial collateral meets the requirements of that section.

          § 628.33   Off-balance sheet exposures.

#### § § 628.33

          (a)  (1) A System institution must calculate the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet exposure using the credit conversion factors (CCFs) in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (2) Where a System institution commits to provide a commitment, the System institution may apply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.

          (3) Where a System institution provides a commitment structured as a syndication or participation, the System institution is only required to calculate the exposure amount for its pro rata share of the commitment.

          (4) Where a System institution provides a commitment, enters into a repurchase agreement, or provides a credit enhancing representation and warranty, and such commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty is not a securitization exposure, the exposure amount shall be no greater than the maximum contractual amount of the commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty, as applicable.

          (5) The exposure amount of a System bank's commitment to an association or OFI is the difference between the association's or OFI's maximum credit limit with the System bank (as established by the general financing agreement or promissory note, as required by § 614.4125(d) of this chapter), and the amount the association or OFI has borrowed from the System bank.

          (b) —(1)  A System institution must apply a 0-percent CCF to a commitment that is unconditionally cancelable by the System institution.

          (2)  A System institution must apply a 20-percent CCF to the amount of:

          (i) Commitments, other than a System bank's commitment to an association or OFI, with an original maturity of 14 months or less that are not unconditionally cancelable by the System institution.

          (ii) Self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods, with an original maturity of 14 months or less.

          (iii) A System bank's commitment to an association or OFI that is not unconditionally cancelable by the System bank, regardless of maturity.

          (3)  A System institution must apply a 50-percent CCF to the amount of:

          (i) Commitments, other than a System bank's commitment to an association or OFI, with an original maturity of more than 14 months that are not unconditionally cancelable by the System institution.

          (ii) Transaction-related contingent items, including performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, and performance standby letters of credit.

          (4)  A System institution must apply a 100-percent CCF to the following off-balance sheet items and other similar transactions:

          (i) Guarantees;

          (ii) Repurchase agreements (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the System institution has sold subject to repurchase);

          (iii) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties that are not securitization exposures;

          (iv) Off-balance sheet securities lending transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the System institution has lent under the transaction);

          (v) Off-balance sheet securities borrowing transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all non-cash positions the System institution has posted as collateral under the transaction);

          (vi) Financial standby letters of credit; and

          (vii) Forward agreements.

          § 628.34   OTC derivative contracts.

#### § § 628.34

          (a) —(1)  Except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section, the exposure amount for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the System institution's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the OTC derivative contract.

          (i)  The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value of the OTC derivative contract or 0.

          (ii)  (A) The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the OTC derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 to § 628.34.

          (B) For purposes of calculating either the PFE under this paragraph or the gross PFE under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency.

          (C) For an OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 1 to § 628.34, the PFE must be calculated using the appropriate “other” conversion factor.

          (D) A System institution must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE.

          (E) The PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.

          (2)  Except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section, the exposure amount for multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE amounts for all OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.

          (i)  The net current credit exposure is the greater of the net sum of all positive and negative mark-to-fair values of the individual OTC derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement or 0.

          (ii)  The adjusted sum of the PFE amounts, Anet, is calculated as:

          (b)  (1) A System institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by using the simple approach in § 628.37(b).

          (2) Alternatively, if the financial collateral securing a contract or netting set described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is marked-to-fair value on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, a System institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures the contract or netting set by using the collateral haircut approach in § 628.37(c).

          (c) —(1)  A System institution that purchases an OTC credit derivative that is recognized under § 628.36 as a credit risk mitigant is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 628.32 provided that the System institution does so consistently for all such credit derivatives. The System institution must either include all or exclude all such credit derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.

          (2)  (i) A System institution that is the protection provider under an OTC credit derivative must treat the OTC credit derivative as an exposure to the underlying reference asset. The System institution is not required to compute a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the OTC credit derivative under § 628.32, provided that this treatment is applied consistently for all such OTC credit derivatives. The System institution must either include all or exclude all such OTC credit derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.

          (ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.

          (d)  (1) A System institution must treat an OTC equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the OTC equity derivative contract under §§ 628.51 through 628.53.

          (2) [Reserved]

          (3) If the System institution risk weights the contract under the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 628.52, the System institution may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of the OTC equity derivative contract, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the OTC equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, a System institution using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.

          (e) [Reserved]

          § 628.35   Cleared transactions.

#### § § 628.35

          (a)—(1)  A System institution that is a clearing member client must use the methodologies described in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate risk-weighted assets for a cleared transaction.

          (2) [Reserved]

          (b) —(1)  (i) To determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a cleared transaction, a System institution that is a clearing member client must multiply the trade exposure amount for the cleared transaction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (ii) A clearing member client System institution's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all its cleared transactions.

          (2)  (i) For a cleared transaction that is either a derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts, the trade exposure amount equals:

          (A) The exposure amount for the derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts, calculated using the current exposure method (CEM) for OTC derivative contracts under § 628.34; plus

          (B) The fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member client System institution and held by the central counterparty (CCP), clearing member, or custodian in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote.

          (ii) For a cleared transaction that is a repo-style transaction, the trade exposure amount equals:

          (A) The exposure amount for the repo-style transaction calculated using the collateral haircut methodology under § 628.37(c); plus

          (B) The fair value of the collateral posted by the clearing member client System institution and held by the CCP or a clearing member in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote.

          (3)  (i) For a cleared transaction with a qualifying CCP (QCCP), a clearing member client System institution must apply a risk weight of:

          (A) Two (2) percent if the collateral posted by the System institution to the QCCP or clearing member is subject to an arrangement that prevents any losses to the clearing member client System institution due to the joint default or a concurrent insolvency, liquidation, or receivership proceeding of the clearing member and any other clearing member clients of the clearing member; and the clearing member client System institution has conducted sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; or

          (B) Four (4) percent if the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section are not met.

          (ii) For a cleared transaction with a CCP that is not a QCCP, a clearing member client System institution must apply the risk weight appropriate for the CCP according to § 628.32.

          (4)  (i) Notwithstanding any other requirements in this section, collateral posted by a clearing member client System institution that is held by a custodian (in its capacity as custodian) in a manner that is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, the custodian, clearing member and other clearing member clients of the clearing member, is not subject to a capital requirement under this section.

          (ii) A clearing member client System institution must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member, or custodian in connection with a cleared transaction in accordance with the requirements under § 628.32.

          (c)-(d) [Reserved]

          § 628.36   Guarantees and credit derivatives: Substitution treatment.

#### § § 628.36

          (a) —(1)  A System institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to an exposure, as provided under this section.

          (2) This section applies to exposures for which:

          (i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or

          (ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the System institution and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.

          (3) Exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) generally are securitization exposures subject to §§ 628.41 through 628.45.

          (4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in this section, a System institution may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a System institution must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (b)  (1) A System institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.

          (2) A System institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:

          (i) The reference exposure ranks  with, or is subordinated to, the hedged exposure; and

          (ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to ensure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligated party of the hedged exposure fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.

          (c) —(1)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, a System institution may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure by substituting the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider under § 628.32 for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.

          (2)  If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in §§ 628.36(a) and 628.37(b) and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, the System institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.

          (i) The System institution may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the protected exposure under § 628.32, where the applicable risk weight is the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider.

          (ii) The System institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the unprotected exposure under § 628.32, where the applicable risk weight is that of the unprotected portion of the hedged exposure.

          (iii) The treatment provided in this section is applicable when the credit risk of an exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis and may be applicable when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section.

          (d)  (1) A System institution that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.

          (2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).

          (3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligated party of the hedged exposure is scheduled to fulfill its obligation on the hedged exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the System institution (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the System institution (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the System institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.

          (4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to 1 year and its residual maturity is greater than 3 months.

          (5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the System institution must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant:

          (e)  If a System institution recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the System institution must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit derivative:

          (f)  (1) If a System institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the System institution must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative:

          (2) A System institution must set  equal to 8 percent.

          (3) A System institution must adjust  calculated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section upward if the System institution revalues the guarantee or credit derivative less frequently than once every 10 business days using the following square root of time formula:

          § 628.37   Collateralized transactions.

#### § § 628.37

          (a)  (1) To recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral, a System institution may use:

          (i) The simple approach in paragraph (b) of this section for any exposure.

          (ii) The collateral haircut approach in paragraph (c) of this section for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized derivative contracts, and single-product netting sets of such transactions.

          (2) A System institution may use any approach described in this section that is valid for a particular type of exposure or transaction; however, it must use the same approach for similar exposures or transactions.

          (b) —(1)  (i) A System institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures any exposure.

          (ii) To qualify for the simple approach, the financial collateral must meet the following requirements:

          (A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;

          (B) The collateral must be revalued at least every 6 months; and

          (C) The collateral (other than gold) and the exposure must be denominated in the same currency.

          (2)  (i) A System institution may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral under § 628.32. For repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions, the collateral is the instruments, gold, and cash the System institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent.

          (ii) A System institution must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight assigned to the exposure under this subpart.

          (3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section:

          (i) A System institution may assign a 0-percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-fair on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contract is collateralized by cash on deposit.

          (ii) A System institution may assign a 10-percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-fair value daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a 0-percent risk weight under § 628.32.

          (iii) A System institution may assign a 0-percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:

          (A) The financial collateral is cash on deposit; or

          (B) The financial collateral is an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a 0-percent risk weight under § 628.32, and the System institution has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.

          (c) —(1)  A System institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or single-product netting set of such transactions by using the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

          (2)  A System institution must determine the exposure amount for an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or a single-product netting set of such transactions by setting the exposure amount equal to max:

          (3)  (i) A System institution must use the haircuts for fair value price volatility (Hs) provided in Table 1 to § 628.37, as adjusted in certain circumstances in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section:

          (ii) For currency mismatches, a System institution must use a haircut for foreign exchange rate volatility (H) of 8 percent, as adjusted in certain circumstances under paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section.

          (iii) For repo-style transactions, a System institution may multiply the standard supervisory haircuts provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section by the square root of   (which equals 0.707107).

          (iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a System institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section upward on the basis of a holding period of 20 business days for the following quarter except in the calculation of the exposure amount for purposes of § 628.35. If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a System institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of 20 business days. If over the 2 previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the System institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set. A System institution must adjust the standard supervisory haircuts upward using the following formula:

          (v) If the instrument a *S*ystem institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral does not meet the definition of financial collateral in § 628.2, the System institution must use a 25-percent haircut for fair value price volatility ().

          (4) [Reserved]

        Risk-Weighted Assets for Unsettled Transactions

          § 628.38   Unsettled transactions.

#### § § 628.38

          (a)  For purposes of this section:

          (1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.

          (2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.

          (3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the fair value standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than 5 business days.

          (4) Positive current exposure of a System institution for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current fair value price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the System institution to the counterparty.

          (b)  This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:

          (1) Cleared transactions that are marked-to-fair value daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;

          (2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions;

          (3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or

          (4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts as provided in § 628.34).

          (c)  In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the FCA may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.

          (d)  A System institution must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the System institution's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within 5 business days after the settlement date. The System institution must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the System institution by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 628.38.

          (e)  (1) A System institution must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the System institution has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The System institution must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the System institution has received its corresponding deliverables.

          (2) From the business day after the System institution has made its delivery until 5 business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the System institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the System institution as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under § 628.32.

          (3) If the System institution has not received its deliverables by the 5th business day after counterparty delivery was due, the System institution must assign a 1,250-percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the System institution.

          (f)  Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.

          §§ 628.39-628.40   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 628.39-628.40

        Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures

          § 628.41   Operational requirements for securitization exposures.

#### § § 628.41

          (a)  A System institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. A System institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. A System institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from CET1 capital, pursuant to § 628.22, any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:

          (1) The exposures are not reported on the System institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;

          (2) The System institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;

          (3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and

          (4) The securitization does not:

          (i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and

          (ii) Contain an early amortization provision.

          (b)  For synthetic securitizations, a System institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph is satisfied. A System institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A System institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:

          (1) The credit risk mitigant is:

          (i) Financial collateral;

          (ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 628.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or

          (iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible credit derivative” in § 628.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 628.2.

          (2) The System institution transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:

          (i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

          (ii) Require the System institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the pool of underlying exposures;

          (iii) Increase the System institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

          (iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the System institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or

          (v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the System institution after the inception of the securitization;

          (3) The System institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and

          (4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.

          (c)  (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from CET1 capital (pursuant to § 628.22) and exposures subject to § 628.42(h), if a System institution is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FCA a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the System institution must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The System institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.

          (2) A System institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure by:

          (i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within 3 business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:

          (A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;

          (B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);

          (C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and

          (D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures; and

          (ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.

          § 628.42   Risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.

#### § § 628.42

          (a)  Except as provided in this section or in § 628.41:

          (1) A System institution must deduct from CET1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization (as provided in § 628.22) and must apply a 1,250-percent risk weight to the portion of a credit-enhancing interest-only strip (CEIO) that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.

          (2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a System institution may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with § 628.43(a) through (d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, a System institution may assign a risk weight to the purchased securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 628.43(e), provided however, that such System institution must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (3), and (4) of this section.

          (3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the System institution cannot or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the System institution must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 628.44.

          (4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by a System institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), a System institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (b)  A System institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the System institution risk weights under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, §§ 628.41(c), and 628.43, 628.44, or § 628.45, except as provided in paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.

          (c)  (1) [Reserved]

          (2)  The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security is the System institution's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.

          (3)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization that is not a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, a cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure.

          (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]

          (4)  The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, or a derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 628.34 or § 628.37 as applicable.

          (d)  If a System institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization, the System institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the System institution may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.

          (e)  If a System institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the System institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):

          (1) The System institution must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from CET1 capital (pursuant to § 628.22) any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and

          (2) The System institution must disclose publicly:

          (i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and

          (ii) The risk-based capital impact to the System institution of providing such implicit support.

          (f)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a System institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.

          (2) For a System institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash payments that the System institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12-month period under the governing facility.

          (g)  Regardless of any other provisions of this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.

          (h)  (1) Regardless of any other provisions of this subpart, a System institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:

          (i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.

          (ii) The System institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the System institution's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.

          (iii) The small business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act.

          (iv) [Reserved]

          (2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by a System institution on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the System institution's total capital.

          (3) If a System institution exceeds the 15-percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the System institution did not exceed the capital limit.

          (4) [Reserved]

          (i)-(ii) [Reserved]

          (i) —(1)  A System institution must assign a risk weight to an n*th*-to-default credit derivative in accordance with FCA guidance.

          (2)-(3) [Reserved]

          (4) —(i)  A System institution that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 628.36(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the System institution synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A System institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 628.34 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 628.36(b).

          (ii)  (A) A System institution that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a nth-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 628.36(b) (other than a first-to-default credit derivative) may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of the derivative only if:

          () The System institution also has obtained credit protection on the same underlying exposures in the form of first-through-(n-_1_)-to-default credit derivatives; or

          () If n-1 of the underlying exposures have already defaulted.

          (B) If a System institution satisfies the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the System institution must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the System institution had only synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the nth smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the underlying exposures.

          (C) A System institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 628.34 for a nth-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 628.36(b).

          (j) —(1)  For a guarantee or credit derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative) provided by a System institution that covers the full amount or a pro rata share of a securitization exposure's principal and interest, the System institution must risk weight the guarantee or credit derivative in accordance with FCA guidance.

          (2)  (i) A System institution that purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 628.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral recognized under § 628.37) is not required to compute a separate credit risk capital requirement under § 628.31, in accordance with § 628.34(c).

          (ii) If a System institution cannot, or chooses not to, recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under § 628.45, the System institution must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative under § 628.34.

          (A) If the System institution purchases credit protection from a counterparty that is not a securitization special purpose entity (SPE), the System institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to general risk weights under § 628.32.

          (B) If the System institution purchases the credit protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the System institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to this section, including paragraph (a)(4) of this section for a credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments).

          § 628.43   Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.

#### § § 628.43

          (a)  To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a System institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contract governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payment on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A System institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.

          (b)  To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a System institution must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:

          (1)  is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using this subpart.  is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1 (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of  equal to .08).

          (2) Parameter  is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1. Parameter  is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures within the securitized pool that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:

          (i) Ninety (90) days or more past due;

          (ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

          (iii) In the process of foreclosure;

          (iv) Held as real estate owned;

          (v) Has contractually deferred interest payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:

          (A) Federally guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or

          (B) Consumer loans, including non-federally guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for periods(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or

          (vi) Is in default.

          (3) Parameter  is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 628.42(i) for nth-to-default credit derivatives, parameter  equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the System institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. ____A____ny reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the System institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter  to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter  is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1.

          (4) Parameter  is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 628.42(i) for nth-to-default credit derivatives, parameter  equals parameter  plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are  with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter  is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1.

          (5) A supervisory calibration parameter,  is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.

          (c) .  and  are used to calculate , the augmented value of , which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying pool of exposures.  is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters  and , relative to  determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (d) of this section and a risk weight of 20 percent.

          (1) When the detachment point, parameter , for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to , the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.

          (2) When the attachment point, parameter , for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to , the System institution must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

          (3) When  is less than  and  is greater than , the risk weight is a weighted average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times  calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. For the purpose of this weighted-average calculation:

          (i) The weight assigned to 1,250 percent equals:

          (ii) The weight assigned to 1,250 percent times  equals:

          (iii) The risk weight will be set equal to:

          (d)  (1) The System institution must define the following parameters:

          (2) Then the System institution must calculate  according to the following equation:

          (3) The risk weight for the exposure (expressed as a percent) is equal to

          (e) —(1)  A System institution may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 628.44 and 628.45.

          (2) To use the gross-up approach, a System institution must calculate the following four inputs:

          (i) Pro rata share , which is the par value of the System institution's securitization exposure  as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides :

          (ii) Enhanced amount , which is the value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the System institution's securitization resides;

          (iii) Exposure amount (carrying value)  of the System institution's securitization exposure calculated under § 628.42(c); and

          (iv) Risk weight (), which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures in the securitization pool as calculated under this subpart. For example,  for an asset-backed security with underlying car loans would be 100 percent.

          (3)  The CEA of a securitization exposure under this section equals the sum of:

          (i) The exposure amount  of the System institution's securitization exposure; plus

          (ii) The pro rata share  multiplied by the enhanced amount , each calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section:

          (4) . To calculate  for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, a System institution must apply the  calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the  calculated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section:

          (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a System institution must assign a risk weight of not less than 20 percent to a securitization exposure.

#### § § 628.44

          (a)  A System institution must assign a 1,250-percent risk weight to all securitization exposures to which the System institution does not apply the SSFA or the gross up approach under § 628.43.

          (b) [Reserved]

          § 628.45   Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures.

#### § § 628.45

          (a)  (1) An originating System institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge its exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization that satisfies the operational criteria provided in § 628.41 may recognize the credit risk mitigant under § 628.36 or § 628.37, but only as provided in this section.

          (2) An investing System institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize the credit risk mitigant under § 628.36 or § 628.37, but only as provided in this section.

          (b)  A System institution must make any applicable adjustment to the protection amount of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative as required in § 628.36(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure. In the context of a synthetic securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the System institution must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all hedged exposures.

          §§ 628.46-628.50   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 628.46-628.50

        Risk-Weighted Assets for Equity Exposures

          § 628.51   Introduction and exposure measurement.

#### § § 628.51

          (a)  (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, a System institution must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in § 628.52. A System institution must use the look-through approaches provided in § 628.53 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds. Equity investments (including preferred stock investments) in other System institutions, service corporations, and the Funding Corporation do not receive a risk weight, because they are deducted from capital in accordance with § 628.22.

          (2)-(3) [Reserved]

          (b)  For purposes of §§ 628.51 through 628.53, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is:

          (1) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure (other than an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale), the System institution's carrying value of the exposure;

          (2) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale, the System institution's carrying value of the exposure less any net unrealized gains on the exposure that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the System institution's regulatory capital components;

          (3) For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is not an equity commitment, the effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

          (4) For a commitment to acquire an equity exposure (an equity commitment), the effective notional principal amount of the exposure is multiplied by the following conversion factors (CFs):

          (i) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of 14 months or less receive a CF of 20 percent.

          (ii) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of over 14 months receive a CF of 50 percent.

          (iii) Unconditional equity commitments receive a CF of 100 percent.

          § 628.52   Simple risk-weight approach (SRWA).

#### § § 628.52

          (a)  Under the SRWA, a System institution's total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the System institution's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined under this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the System institution's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined under § 628.53.

          (b)  A System institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest applicable risk weight in this paragraph.

          (1)  An equity exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, an MDB, and any other entity whose credit exposures receive a 0-percent risk weight under § 628.32 may be assigned a 0-percent risk weight.

          (2)  An equity exposure to a PSE or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) must be assigned a 20-percent risk weight.

          (3)  The equity exposures set forth in this paragraph (b)(3) must be assigned a 100-percent risk weight:

          (i) [Reserved]

          (ii)  The effective portion of a hedge pair.

          (iii)  Equity exposures, excluding exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization in § 628.2 were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the System institution's total capital.

          (A) Equity exposures subject to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section include:

          () Equity exposures to unconsolidated unincorporated business entities and equity exposures held through consolidated unincorporated business entities, as authorized by subpart J of part 6_1_1 of this chapter; and

          () [Reserved]

          () Equity exposures to an unconsolidated rural business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated rural business investment company described in 7 U.S.C. 2009cc

          (B) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a System institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the System institution may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a System institution does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the System institution may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the System institution must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.

          (C) When determining which of a System institution's equity exposures qualify for a 100-percent risk weight under this paragraph, a System institution first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated rural business investment companies or held through consolidated rural business investment companies described in 7 U.S.C. 2009cc  then must include equity exposures to unconsolidated unincorporated business entities and equity exposures held through consolidated unincorporated business entities, as authorized by subpart J of part 611 of this chapter; then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds); and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).

          (4)  The risk weight for any equity exposure that does not qualify for a risk weight under paragraph (b)(1), (2), (3), or (7) of this section will be determined by the FCA.

          (5)-(6) [Reserved]

          (7)  An equity exposure to an investment firm must be assigned a 600-percent risk weight, provided that the investment firm:

          (i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization in § 628.2 were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition; and

          (ii) Has greater than immaterial leverage.

          (c) —(1)  A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.

          (2)  Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least 3 months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the System institution acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the System institution will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A System institution must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E as set forth in this paragraph (c):

          (i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the System institution must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, less than 0 and greater than or equal to −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.

          (ii) Under the variability-reduction method of measuring effectiveness:

          (iii) Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then E equals 0.

          (3) The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

          (4) The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.

          § 628.53   Equity exposures to investment funds.

#### § § 628.53

          (a)  (1) A System institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach described in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alterative modified look-through approach described paragraph (d) of this section, provided, however, that the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an equity exposure under this section is 20 percent.

          (2) [Reserved]

          (3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the System institution does not use the full look-through approach, the System institution must use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 628.52(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.

          (b)  A System institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the System institution) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the System institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:

          (1) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the System institution; and

          (2) The System institution's proportional ownership share of the fund.

          (c)  Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a System institution's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).

          (d)  Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a System institution may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under this subpart based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the System institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under this subpart. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the System institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under this subpart and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under this subpart until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the System institution must use the highest applicable risk weight. A System institution may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.

        Disclosures

          § 628.61   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 628.61

          Sections 628.62 and 628.63 establish public disclosure requirements for each System bank related to the capital requirements contained in this part.

          § 628.62   Disclosure requirements.

#### § § 628.62

          (a) A System bank must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 628.63. The System bank must make these disclosures in its quarterly and annual reports to shareholders required in part 620 of this chapter. The System bank need not make these disclosures in the format set out in the applicable tables or all in the same location in a report, as long as a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures is provided. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the System bank's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. This disclosure requirement may be satisfied by providing a notice under § 620.15 of this chapter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the System bank's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the 4th calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim.

          (b) A System bank must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. The chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and a designated board member must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.

          (c) If a System bank concludes that disclosure of specific proprietary or confidential commercial or financial information that it would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would compromise its position, then the System bank is not required to disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.

          § 628.63   Disclosures.

#### § § 628.63

          (a) Except as provided in § 628.62, a System bank must make the disclosures described in Tables 1 through 10 of this section. The System bank must make these disclosures publicly available for each of the last 3 years (that is, 12 quarters) or such shorter period beginning on January 1, 2017.

          (b) A System bank must publicly disclose each quarter the following:

          (1) CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios, including all the regulatory capital elements and all the regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate the numerator of such ratios;

          (2) Total risk-weighted assets, including the different regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate total risk-weighted assets;

          (3) [Reserved]

          (4) A reconciliation of regulatory capital elements using month-end balances as they relate to its balance sheet in any applicable audited consolidated financial statements. The reconciliation must include a statement that compliance with the regulatory capital requirements outlined in subpart B of this part is determined using average daily balances for the most recent 3 months.

          (c)  For each separate risk area described in tables 5 through 10 of this section, the System bank must describe its risk management objectives and policies, including: Strategies and processes; the structure and organization of the relevant risk management function; the scope and nature of risk reporting and/or measurement systems; policies for hedging and/or mitigating risk and strategies and processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants.

      Subpart C—Quarterly Reports to Investors

        § 630.40   Contents of the quarterly report to investors.

#### § § 630.40

        (a)  The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.

        (b)  For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.

        (1)  When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

        (2)  When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.

        (3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices) and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year may be omitted.

        (4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred.

        (5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it.

        (6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included. If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made.

        (7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.

        (8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material, it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.

        (c)  Discuss any material changes to the information disclosed to investors pursuant to § 630.20(g) that have occurred during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provide any additional information needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

        (1)  Discuss any material changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided.

        (2)  Discuss any material changes in the combined results of operations of the System with respect to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year. Such discussion shall also cover material changes with respect to the most recent fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year.

        (d)  Interim combined financial statements must be provided in the quarterly report to investors as set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4). Indicate that the financial statements were prepared under the oversight of the System Audit Committee.

        (1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.

        (2) Interim statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable periods for the previous fiscal year.

        (3) Interim statements of changes in capital stock and surplus (or, if applicable, interim statements of changes in protected borrower capital and capital stock and surplus) for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.

        (4) Interim statements of cash flows for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the comparable period for the preceding fiscal year.

        (e)  The interim report shall present supplemental information in accordance with the requirements of § 630.20 (m)(2), (m)(3), and (m)(4), as well as other requirements and instructions of the FCA, and shall include, at a minimum, the following:

        (1) Supplemental balance sheet information as of the end of the most recent quarter; and

        (2) Supplemental income statement information for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter.

        (f)  Unless otherwise ordered by the FCA as a result of a supervisory action, the interim financial statements and supplemental information need not be audited or reviewed by an independent public accountant prior to filing. If, however, a review of the report is made in accordance with the established professional standards and procedures for such a review, a statement that the independent accountant has performed such a review may be included. If such a statement is made, the report of the independent accountant on such review shall accompany the interim financial information.

#### § § 652.10

At least annually, your board, or a designated committee of the board, must review the sufficiency of these investment policies. Any changes to the policies must be adopted by the board. You must report any changes to these policies to the OSMO within 10 business days of adoption.

        (b)  Your investment policies must address the purposes and objectives of investments, risk tolerance, delegations of authority, internal controls, due diligence, and reporting requirements.

Risk limits must be based on all relevant factors, including the Corporation's objectives, capital position, earnings, and quality and reliability of risk management systems. Your policies must identify the types and quantity of investments that you will hold to achieve your objectives and control credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. Your policies must establish risk limits for the following types of risk:

        (1)  Your investment policies must establish:

        (i) Credit quality standards, limits on counterparty risk, and risk diversification standards that limit concentrations in a single or related counterparty(ies), industry sectors, and asset classes or obligations with similar characteristics.

As part of your review of your investment policies required under paragraph (a) of this section, your board of directors, or a designated committee of the board, must review the criteria for selecting securities firms. Any changes to the criteria must be approved by the board.

        (iii) Collateral margin requirements on repurchase agreements. You must regularly mark the collateral to market and ensure appropriate controls are maintained over collateral held.

        (2)  Your investment policies must set market risk limits for specific types of investments and for the investment portfolio.

        (3)  Your investment policies must describe the liquidity characteristics of eligible investments that you will hold to meet your liquidity needs and the Corporation's other objectives.

        (5)  Your investment policies must set risk diversification standards. Diversification parameters must be based on the carrying value of investments.

        (d)  All delegations of authority to specified personnel or committees must state the extent of management's authority and responsibilities for investments.

        (e)  You must:

        (1) Establish appropriate internal controls to detect and prevent loss, fraud, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized investments.

        (2) Establish and maintain a separation of duties between personnel who supervise or execute investment transactions and personnel who supervise or engage in all other investment-related functions.

        (3) Maintain records and management information systems that are appropriate for the level and complexity of your investment activities.

        (4) Implement an effective internal audit program to review, at least annually, your investment management functions, controls, processes, and compliance with FCA regulations. The scope of the annual review must be appropriate for the size, risk, and complexity of the investment portfolio.

        (f) —(1) —(i)  Before you purchase an investment, you must conduct sufficient due diligence to determine whether the investment is eligible under § 652.20, is for an authorized purpose under § 652.15(a), and complies with your board-approved investment policies. You must document its eligibility, purpose, and investment policy compliance and your investment objective. Your investment policies must fully address the extent of pre-purchase analysis that management must perform for various types, classes, and structure of investments. Your board must approve your decision to hold an investment that does not comply with your written investment policy requirements.

        (ii)  Prior to purchase, you must verify the value of the investment (unless it is a new issue) with a source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty or other intermediary to the transaction.

        (iii)  Your risk assessment must be documented and, at a minimum, include an evaluation of credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk and the underlying collateral of the investment. You must conduct stress testing before you purchase any investment that is structured or that has uncertain cash flows, including all mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed securities. The stress testing must be commensurate with the risk and complexity of the investments and must comply with the requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

        (2)  At least monthly, you must determine the fair market value of each investment in your portfolio and the fair market value of your whole investment portfolio.

        (3)  You must establish and maintain processes to monitor and evaluate changes in the credit quality of each security and the whole investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.

        (4)  (i) You must stress test your entire investment portfolio, including stress tests of all investments individually and stress tests of the portfolio as a whole, at the end of each quarter. The stress tests must enable you to determine that your investment securities, both individually and on a portfolio-wide basis, do not expose your capital, earnings, or liquidity to risks that exceed the risk tolerance specified in your investment policies. If your portfolio risk exceeds your investment policy limits, you must develop a plan to reduce risk and comply with your investment policy limits.

        (ii) Your stress tests must be comprehensive and appropriate for the risk profile of your investment portfolio and the Corporation. At a minimum, the stress tests must be able to measure the price sensitivity of investments over a range of possible interest rate/yield curve scenarios. The methodology that you use to analyze investment securities must be appropriate for the complexity, structure, and cash flows of the investments in your portfolio. You must rely to the maximum extent practicable on verifiable information to support all your assumptions, including prepayment and interest rate volatility assumptions, when you apply your stress tests. Your assumptions must be prudent and based on sound judgment, and you must document the basis for all assumptions that you use to evaluate the security and its underlying collateral. You must also document all subsequent changes in your assumptions.

        (5)  Before you sell an investment, you must verify its value with a source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty, or other intermediary to the transaction.

        (g)  At least quarterly, executive management must report on the following to the board of directors or a designated committee of the board:

        (1) Plans and strategies for achieving the board's objectives for the investment portfolio;

        (2) Whether the investment portfolio effectively achieves the board's objectives;

        (3) The current composition, quality, and liquidity profile of the investment portfolio;

        (4) The performance of each class of investments and the entire investment portfolio, including all gains and losses that you incurred during the quarter on individual securities that you sold before maturity and why they were liquidated;

        (5) Potential risk exposure to changes in market interest rates as identified through quarterly stress testing and any other factors that may affect the value of your investment holdings;

        (6) How investments affect your capital, earnings, and overall financial condition;

        (7) Any deviations from the board's policies. These deviations must be formally approved by the board of directors.

        § 652.25   Ineligible investments.

#### § § 652.25

        (a)  Non-program investments that do not satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in § 652.20(a) or have not been approved by the FCA pursuant to § 652.23 at the time of purchase are ineligible. You must not purchase ineligible investments. If you determine that you have purchased an ineligible investment, you must notify us within 15 calendar days after such determination. You must divest of the investment no later than 60 calendar days after you determine that the investment is ineligible unless we approve, in writing, a plan that authorizes you to divest the investment over a longer period of time. Until you divest of the investment, it may not be used to satisfy your liquidity requirement(s) under § 652.40, but must continue to be included in the § 652.15(b) investment portfolio limit calculation.

        (b)  If you determine that a non-program investment no longer satisfies the criteria set forth in § 652.20 or no longer satisfies the conditions of approval issued under § 652.23, you must notify us within 15 calendar days after such determination.

#### § § 652.27

        FCA retains the authority to require you to divest of any investment at any time for failure to comply with applicable regulations, for safety and soundness reasons, or failure to comply with written conditions of approval. The timeframe set by FCA for such required divestiture will consider the expected loss on the transaction (or transactions) and the effect on your financial condition and performance. FCA may also, on a case-by-case basis, determine that a particular non-program investment poses inappropriate risk, notwithstanding that it satisfies investment eligibility criteria or received prior approval from us. If so, we will notify you as to the proper treatment of the investment.

        (b) The board of directors of Farmer Mac must adopt an interest rate risk management policy that establishes appropriate interest rate risk exposure limits based on the Corporation's risk-bearing capacity and reporting requirements in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. At least annually, the board of directors, or a designated committee of the board, must review the policy. Any changes to the policy must be approved by the board of directors.

Your stress tests must gauge how interest rate fluctuations affect the Corporation's capital, earnings, and liquidity position. The methodology that you use must be appropriate for the complexity of the structure and cash flows of your on- and off-balance sheet positions, including the nature and purpose of derivative contracts, and establish counterparty risk thresholds and limits for derivatives. It must also ensure an appropriate level of consistency with the stress-test scenarios considered under § 652.10(f)(4). Assumptions applied in stress tests must, to the maximum extent practicable, rely on verifiable information. You must document the basis for all assumptions that you use.

        (4) Describe and authorize management to implement actions needed to achieve Farmer Mac's desired risk management objectives;

        § 652.35   Liquidity management.

#### § § 652.35

        (2)  Farmer Mac must report, in writing, to the OSMO no later than the next business day following the discovery of any breach of the minimum liquidity reserve requirement in § 652.40 of this subpart.

        (d)  Farmer Mac must have a liability maturity management plan (LMMP) that its board of directors reviews and approves at least once each year. The LMMP must establish a funding strategy that provides for effective diversification of the sources and tenors of funding, and considers Farmer Mac's risk profile and current market conditions. The LMMP must include targets of acceptable ranges of the proportion of debt maturing within specific time periods.

        (e)  (1)  Farmer Mac must have a CFP to ensure sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund normal operations under a variety of stress events. Such stress events include, but are not limited to market disruptions, rapid increase in contractually required loan purchases, unexpected requirements to fund commitments or revolving lines of credit or to fulfill guarantee obligations, difficulties in renewing or replacing funding with desired terms and structures, requirements to pledge collateral with counterparties, and reduced market access.

The board of directors must review and approve the CFP at least once each year and must make adjustments to reflect changes in the results of stress tests, Farmer Mac's risk profile, and market conditions.

        (3) The CFP must:

        (i) Be customized to the financial condition and liquidity risk profile of Farmer Mac, the board's liquidity risk tolerance, and Farmer Mac's business model;

        (ii) Identify funding alternatives that can be implemented as access to funding is impeded;

        (iii) Establish a process for managing events that imperil Farmer Mac's liquidity. The process must assign appropriate personnel and executable action plans to implement the CFP;

        (iv) Require periodic stress testing that analyzes the possible impacts on Farmer Mac's cash flows, liquidity position, profitability, and solvency for a wide variety of stress scenarios.

#### § § 652.40

        (a)  All investments that Farmer Mac holds in its liquidity reserve and as supplemental liquidity in accordance with this section must be unencumbered. For the purposes of this section, an investment is unencumbered if it is free of lien, and it is not explicitly or implicitly pledged to secure, collateralize, or enhance the credit of any transaction. Additionally, an unencumbered investment held in the liquidity reserve cannot be used as a hedge against interest rate risk if liquidation of that particular investment would expose Farmer Mac to a material risk of loss.

        (c)  Farmer Mac must maintain at all times a liquidity reserve sufficient to fund at least 90 days of the principal portion of maturing obligations and other borrowings. Farmer Mac must also hold supplemental liquid assets sufficient to fund obligations and other borrowings maturing after 90 calendar days to meet board liquidity policy in accordance with § 652.35. At a minimum, Farmer Mac must hold instruments in the liquidity reserve, and as supplemental liquidity, that are listed and discounted in accordance with the following table, and are sufficient to cover:

        (1) Days 1 through 15 only with Level 1 instruments;

        (2) Days 16 through 30 only with Level 1 and Level 2 instruments; and,

        (3) Days 31 through 90 with Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 instruments.

        § 652.65   Risk-based capital stress test.

#### § § 652.65

        You will perform the risk-based capital stress test as described in summary form below and as described in detail in appendix A to this subpart. The risk-based capital stress test spreadsheet is also available electronically at  The risk-based capital stress test has five components:

        (a) . You will use the following data to implement the risk-based capital stress test.

        (1) You will use Corporation loan-level data to implement the credit risk component of the risk-based capital stress test.

        (2) You will use Call Report data as the basis for Corporation data over the 10-year stress period supplemented with your interest rate risk measurements and tax data.

        (3) You will use other data, including the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate and the applicable Internal Revenue Service corporate income tax schedule, as further described in appendix A to this subpart.

        (b)  The credit risk part estimates loan losses during a period of sustained economic stress.

        (1) For each loan in the Farmer Mac I portfolio, you will determine a default probability by using the logit functions specified in appendix A to this subpart with each of the following variables:

        (i) Borrower's debt-to-asset ratio at loan origination;

        (ii) Loan-to-value ratio at origination, which is the loan amount divided by the value of the property;

        (iii) Debt-service-coverage ratio at origination, which is the borrower's net income (on- and off-farm) plus depreciation, capital lease payments, and interest, less living expenses and income taxes, divided by the total term debt payments;

        (iv) The origination loan balance stated in 1997 dollars based on the consumer price index; and,

        (v) The worst-case percentage change in farmland values (23.52 percent).

        (2) You will then calculate the loss rate by multiplying the default probability for each loan by the estimated loss-severity rate, which is the average loss of the defaulted loans in the data set (20.9 percent).

        (3) You will calculate losses by multiplying the loss rate by the origination loan balances stated in 1997 dollars.

        (4) You will adjust the losses for loan seasoning, based on the number of years since loan origination, according to the functions in appendix A to this subpart.

        (5) You will calculate loss rates on rural utility loans as further described in appendix A.

        (6) You will further adjust losses for loans that collateralize the general obligation of AgVantage Plus volume, and for loans where the program loan counterparty retains a subordinated interest in accordance with appendix A to this subpart.

        (7) The losses must be applied in the risk-based capital stress test as specified in appendix A to this subpart.

        (c)  (1) During the first year of the stress period, you will adjust interest rates for two scenarios, an increase in rates and a decrease in rates. You must determine your risk-based capital level based on whichever scenario would require more capital.

        (2) You will calculate the interest rate stress based on changes to the quarterly average of the 10-year CMT. The starting rate is the 3-month average of the most recent CMT monthly rate series. To calculate the change in the starting rate, determine the average yield of the preceding 12 monthly 10-year CMT rates. Then increase and decrease the starting rate by:

        (i) 50 percent of the 12-month average if the average rate is less than 12 percent; or

        (ii) 600 basis points if the 12-month average rate is equal to or higher than 12 percent.

        (3) Following the first year of the stress period, interest rates remain at the new level for the remainder of the stress period.

        (4) You will apply the interest rate changes scenario as indicated in appendix A to this subpart.

        (5) You may use other interest rate indices in addition to the 10-year CMT subject to our concurrence, but in no event can your risk-based capital level be less than that determined by using only the 10-year CMT.

        (d)  (1) You must adjust your financial statements based on the credit risk inputs and interest rate risk inputs described above to generate pro forma financial statements for each year of the 10-year stress test. The cashflow generator produces these financial statements. You may use the cashflow generator spreadsheet that is described in appendix A to this subpart and available electronically at  You may also use any reliable cashflow program that can develop or produce pro forma financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles and widely recognized financial modeling methods, subject to our concurrence. You may disaggregate financial data to any greater degree than that specified in appendix A to this subpart, subject to our concurrence.

        (2) You must use model assumptions to generate financial statements over the 10-year stress period. The major assumption is that cashflows generated by the risk-based capital stress test are based on a steady-state scenario. To implement a steady-state scenario, when on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities amortize or are paid down, you must replace them with similar assets and liabilities (AgVantage Plus volume is not replaced when it matures). Replace amortized assets from discontinued loan programs with current loan programs. In general, keep assets with small balances in constant proportions to key program assets.

        (3) You must simulate annual pro forma balance sheets and income statements in the risk-based capital stress test using Farmer Mac's starting position, the credit risk and interest rate risk components, resulting cashflow outputs, current operating strategies and policies, and other inputs as shown in appendix A to this subpart and the electronic spreadsheet available at

        (e)  The calculations that you must use to solve for the starting regulatory capital amount are shown in appendix A to this subpart and in the electronic spreadsheet available at
