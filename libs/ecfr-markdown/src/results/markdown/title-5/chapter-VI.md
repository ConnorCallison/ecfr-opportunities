      (b) Uniformed services members may elect to contribute from basic pay and, if they elect to contribute from basic pay, special or incentive pay (including bonus pay) subject to the limits described in § 1600.22.

    Subpart D—Rollovers From Other Qualified Retirement Plans

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 31672, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1600.30   Accounts eligible for rollover.

#### § § 1600.30

      (a) A participant who has an open TSP account and is entitled to receive (or receives) an eligible rollover distribution from an eligible employer plan within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 402(c)), or from a traditional IRA may roll over that distribution into his or her existing TSP account in accordance with § 1600.31.

      (b) The only balances that the TSP record keeper will accept are balances that would otherwise be includible in gross income if the distribution were paid to the participant. The TSP record keeper will not accept any balances that have already been subjected to Federal income tax (after-tax monies) or balances from a uniformed services TSP account that will not be subject to Federal income tax (tax-exempt monies).

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the TSP record keeper will accept Roth funds that are transferred via direct rollover from an eligible employer plan that maintains a qualified Roth contribution program described in section 402A of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (d) The TSP record keeper will accept a rollover only to the extent the rollover is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

      § 1600.31   Methods for rolling over eligible rollover distribution to the TSP.

#### § § 1600.31

      (a)  (1) A participant may request that the administrator or trustee of an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA roll over any or all of his or her account directly to the TSP in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. The administrator or trustee must provide to the TSP record keeper the distribution, information about the type of money included in the distribution ( tax-deferred and/or Roth amounts), and sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution (as defined by 26 CFR 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-14). By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan administrator or trustee indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, a payment confirmation, distribution statement or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.

      (2) If the distribution is from a Roth account maintained by an eligible employer plan, the plan administrator must also provide to the TSP record keeper a statement indicating the first year of the participant's Roth 5 year non-exclusion period under the distributing plan and either:

      (i) The portion of the direct rollover amount that represents Roth contributions ( basis); or

      (ii) A statement that the entire amount of the direct rollover is a qualified Roth distribution (as defined by Internal Revenue Code section 402A(d)(2)).

      (b)  A participant who has already received a distribution from an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA may request to roll over all or part of the distribution into the TSP in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. However, the TSP record keeper will not accept a rollover by the participant of Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan. A distribution of Roth funds from an eligible employer plan may be rolled into the TSP by direct rollover only. The TSP record keeper will accept a rollover by the participant of tax-deferred amounts if the following requirements and conditions are satisfied:

      (1) The participant must request to roll over the amounts in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.

      (2) The administrator or trustee must provide to the TSP record keeper information about the type of money included in the distribution ( tax-deferred and/or Roth) and sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution. By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, a payment confirmation, distribution statement or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.

      (3) The participant must submit a certified check, cashier's check, cashier's draft, money order, treasurer's check from a credit union, or personal check, made out to the “Thrift Savings Plan,” for the entire amount of the rollover, along with any other information required by the TSP record keeper. A participant may roll over the full amount of the distribution by making up, from his or her own funds, the amount that was withheld from the distribution for the payment of Federal taxes.

      (4) The transaction must be completed within 60 days of the participant's receipt of the distribution from his or her eligible employer plan or traditional IRA. The transaction is not complete until the TSP record keeper receives the guaranteed funds for the amount to be rolled over, information sufficient to conclude that the amount is a valid rollover contribution, and any other information required by the TSP record keeper.

      (c)  When rolling over a distribution to the TSP by either a direct or indirect rollover, the participant must certify that the distribution is eligible for roll over into the TSP, as follows:

      (1)  The participant must certify that the distribution:

      (i) Is not one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives of the participant and designated beneficiary, if applicable) or for a period of 10 years or more;

      (ii) Is not a minimum distribution required by I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9));

      (iii) Is not a hardship distribution;

      (iv) Is not a plan loan that is deemed to be a taxed loan because of default;

      (v) Is not a return of excess elective deferrals; and

      (vi) If not rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid. This paragraph (c)(1)(vi) shall not apply to Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan.

      (2)  The participant must certify that the distribution:

      (i) Is not a minimum distribution required under I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9)); and

      (ii) If not rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid.

      § 1600.32   Treatment accorded rollover funds.

#### § § 1600.32

      (a) All funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 will be treated as employee contributions.

      (b) All funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 will be invested in accordance with the participant's investment election on file at the time the rollover is completed.

      (c) Funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 are not subject to the limits on contributions described in § 1600.22.

      § 1600.33   Combining uniformed services accounts and civilian accounts.

#### § § 1600.33

      Uniformed services TSP account balances and civilian TSP account balances may be combined (thus producing one account), subject to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section:

      (a) An account balance can be combined with another once the TSP record keeper is informed (by the participant's employing agency) that the participant has separated from Government service.

      (b) Tax-exempt contributions may not be transferred from a uniformed services TSP account to a civilian TSP account.

      (c) A traditional balance and a Roth balance cannot be combined.

      (d) Funds transferred to the gaining account will be allocated among the TSP core funds according to the investment election in effect for the account into which the funds are transferred.

      (e) Funds transferred to the gaining account will be treated as employee contributions and otherwise invested as described at 5 CFR part 1600.

      (f) A uniformed service member must obtain the consent of his or her spouse before combining a uniformed services TSP account balance with his or her civilian account, even if the civilian account is not subject to FERS spousal rights. A request for an exception to the spousal consent requirement will be evaluated under the rules explained in 5 CFR part 1650.

      (g) A loan cannot be transferred between accounts. Before the accounts can be combined, any outstanding loans from the losing account must be closed as described in 5 CFR part 1655.

      § 1600.34   Automatic enrollment program.

#### § § 1600.34

      (a) All newly hired civilian employees who are eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan and those civilian employees who are rehired after a separation in service of 31 or more calendar days and who are eligible to participate in the TSP will automatically have 5% of their basic pay contributed to the employee's traditional TSP balance (default employee contribution) unless, by the end of the employee's first pay period (subject to the agency's processing time frames), they elect:

      (1) To not contribute;

      (2) To contribute at some other level; or

      (3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.

      (b) All uniformed service members who either enter service on or after January 1, 2018 or re-enter service after a separation in service of 31 or more calendar days after having been covered by BRS at the time of separation will automatically have 5% of their basic pay contributed to the member's traditional TSP balance (default employee contribution) beginning the first full pay period following the date that is 60 days after the member's PEBD unless they elect by the end of that 60 day period:

      (1) To not contribute;

      (2) To contribute at some other level; or

      (3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.

      (c) If, for any calendar year, a uniformed service member described in paragraph (b) of this section does not make a contribution in the final full pay period of such calendar year due to the member's election to terminate contributions prior to the final full pay period, then that member will automatically have 5% of his or her basic pay contributed to his or her traditional TSP balance beginning the first full pay period of the following calendar year unless he or she makes a subsequent election by December 31st:

      (1) To not contribute;

      (2) To contribute at some other level;

      (3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.

      § 1600.35   Refunds of default employee contributions.

#### § § 1600.35

      (a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (f) of this section, a participant may request a refund of any default employee contributions made on his or her behalf ( the contributions made while under the automatic enrollment program) provided the request is received within 90 days after the date that the first default employee contribution was processed. The election may be made on the TSP website or by completing the TSP's refund request form and must be received by the TSP's record keeper prior to the expiration of the 90-day period.

      (1) The distribution of a refund will be reported as income to the participant on IRS Form 1099-R, but it will not be subject to the additional tax under 26 U.S.C. 72(t) (the early withdrawal penalty tax).

      (2) A participant who requests a refund will receive the amount of any default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).

      (3) Processing of refunds will be subject to the rules set out at 5 CFR part 1650.

      (b) A participant will no longer be considered to be covered by the automatic enrollment program if the participant files a contribution election. Consequently, if a participant makes a contribution election during the 90-day period, the participant will only be eligible to receive as a refund an amount equal to his or her default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).

      (c) After the expiration of the period allowed for the refund, any withdrawal must be made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8433 and 5 CFR part 1650.

      (d) A married participant may request a refund of default employee contributions without obtaining the consent of his or her spouse or having the TSP record keeper notify the spouse of the request.

      (e) The rules applicable to frozen accounts (5 CFR 1650.3) and applicable to deceased participants (5 CFR 1650.6) also apply to refunds of the default employee contributions.

      (f) A participant may not receive a refund of default employee contributions made pursuant to § 1600.34(c).

#### § § 1600.36

      (b) The matching contributions and associated earnings attributable to refunded default employee contributions shall be forfeited to the TSP and used to offset administrative expenses.

      § 1600.37   Notice.

#### § § 1600.37

      The TSP record keeper shall furnish all new employees and all rehired employees covered by the automatic enrollment program, and all employees described in paragraph (c) of § 1600.34, covered by the automatic enrollment program a notice that accurately describes:

      (a) That default employee contributions equal to 5 percent of the employee's basic pay will be deducted from the employee's pay and contributed to the employee's traditional TSP balance on the employee's behalf if the employee does not make an affirmative contribution election;

      (b) The employee's right to elect to not have default employee contributions made to the TSP on the employee's behalf, to elect to have a different percentage or amount of basic pay contributed to the TSP, or to make Roth contributions;

      (c) The TSP core fund in which the default employee and agency contributions will be invested unless the employee makes an investment election;

      (d) The employee's ability (or inability) to request a refund of any default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses) and the procedure to request such a refund; and

      (e) That an investment in any fund other than the G Fund is made at the employee's risk, that the employee is not protected by the United States Government or the Board against any loss on the investment, and that neither the United States Government nor the Board guarantees any return on the investment.

      § 1601.11   Applicability.

#### § § 1601.11

      This subpart applies only to the investment of future deposits to the TSP core funds, including contributions, loan payments, and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans; it does not apply to fund reallocations or fund transfers within the TSP core funds, which is covered in subpart C of this part, or fund transfers to and from the mutual fund window, which is covered in subpart F of this part.

      § 1601.12   Investing future deposits in the TSP core funds.

#### § § 1601.12

      (a)  Future deposits in the TSP, including contributions, loan payments, and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans, will be allocated among the TSP core funds based on the most recent investment election on file for the participant.

      (b)  All participants may elect to invest all or any portion of their deposits in any of the TSP core funds.

      § 1601.13   Elections.

#### § § 1601.13

      (a)  Each participant may indicate his or her choice of TSP core funds for the allocation of future deposits in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section apply to investment elections:

      (1) Investment elections must be made in one percent increments. The sum of the percentages elected for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.

      (2) The percentage elected by a participant for investment of future deposits in a TSP core fund will be applied to all sources of contributions and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans. A participant may not make different percentage elections for different sources of contributions.

      (3) The following default investment rules shall apply to civilian participants:

      (i) All deposits made on behalf of a civilian participant enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the G Fund. A civilian participant who is enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, and subsequently rehired on or after September 5, 2015, and has a positive account balance will be considered enrolled prior to September 5, 2015 for purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(i); and

      (ii) All deposits made on behalf of a civilian participant first enrolled on or after September 5, 2015, who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund.

      (iii) A civilian participant enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, who elects for the first time to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund must execute an acknowledgement of risk in accordance with § 1601.33.

      (4) The default investment rule in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to uniformed services participants:

      (i) All deposits made on behalf of a uniformed services participant who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, has not elected to be covered by BRS, and does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the G Fund.

      (ii) All deposits made on behalf of a uniformed services participant who first entered service on or after January 1, 2018, and who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund.

      (iii) If a uniformed services participant makes an election to be covered by BRS as described in 5 CFR 1600.14 and does not have an investment election in effect at the time of the election, then all deposits made after the date of such election will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund. Deposits made prior to the date of the election will remain invested in the G Fund.

      (iv) A uniformed services participant who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, and has not made an election to be covered by the BRS who elects for the first time to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund must execute an acknowledgement of risk in accordance with § 1601.33.

      (5) Once an investment election becomes effective, it remains in effect until it is superseded by a subsequent investment election or the participant's account balance is reduced to zero. If a rehired participant has a positive account balance and an investment election in effect, then the participant's investment election will remain in effect until a new election is made. If, however, the participant (other than a participant described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) has a zero account balance, then the participant's contributions will be allocated to the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund until a new investment election is made.

      (b)  If a participant does not correctly complete an investment election, the attempted investment election will have no effect. The TSP record keeper will provide the participant with a written statement of the reason the transaction was rejected.

      (c)  A participant may designate the amount or type of employee contributions he or she wishes to make to the TSP or may stop contributions only in accordance with 5 CFR part 1600.

    Subpart C—Fund Reallocations and Fund Transfers

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 31674, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1601.21   Applicability.

#### § § 1601.21

      This subpart applies only to fund reallocations and fund transfers involving the movement of money from TSP core fund to one (or more) TSP core fund(s); it does not apply to the investment of future deposits, which is covered in subpart B of this part, nor does it apply to fund transfers involving the movement of money from the TSP core funds to the mutual fund window (and vice versa), which is covered in subpart F of this part.

      § 1601.22   Methods of requesting a fund reallocation.

#### § § 1601.22

      (a) Participants may make a fund reallocation in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to a fund reallocation request:

      (1) Fund reallocation requests must be made in whole percentages (one percent increments). The sum of the percentages elected for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.

      (2) The percentages elected by the participant will be applied to the balances in each source of contributions and to both traditional and Roth balances and tax-deferred and tax-exempt balances on the effective date of the fund reallocation.

      (b) A fund reallocation request has no effect on deposits made after the effective date of the fund reallocation request; subsequent deposits will continue to be allocated among the TSP core funds in accordance with the participant's investment election made under subpart B of this part.

      (c) If a fund reallocation is found to be invalid pursuant to § 1601.34, the purported fund reallocation will not be made.

      § 1601.23   Methods of requesting a fund transfer.

#### § § 1601.23

      (a) Participants may make a fund transfer from one or more TSP core fund to a different TSP core fund(s) in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to a fund transfer request:

      (1) Fund transfer requests when selecting the TSP core funds to transfer out of, may be made in whole percentages or in dollars. When selecting the TSP core funds to transfer into, elections must be made in whole percentages (one percent increments). The sum of the percentages elected to transfer into for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.

      (2) The percentages elected by the participant will be applied to the balances in each source of contributions and to both traditional and Roth balances and tax-deferred and tax-exempt balances on the effective date of the fund transfer.

      (b) A fund transfer request has no effect on deposits made after the effective date of the fund transfer request; subsequent deposits will continue to be allocated among the TSP core funds in accordance with the participant's investment election made under subpart B of this part.

      (c) If a fund transfer is found to be invalid pursuant to § 1601.34, the purported fund transfer will not be made.

    Subpart D—Investment Elections and Fund Reallocation and Fund Transfer Requests

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 31675, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1601.31   Applicability.

#### § § 1601.31

      This subpart applies to investment elections made under subpart B of this part, fund reallocations and fund transfers made under subpart C of this part, and fund transfers made under subpart F of this part.

      § 1601.32   Timing and posting dates.

#### § § 1601.32

      (a)  The date on which an investment election or fund reallocation or fund transfer request (transaction request) is processed is subject to a number of factors, including some that are outside of the control of the TSP, such as power outages, the failure of telephone service, unusually heavy transaction volume, and acts of God. These factors also could affect the availability of the TSP website and the ThriftLine. Therefore, the TSP cannot guarantee that a transaction request will be processed on a particular day. However, the TSP will process transaction requests under ordinary circumstances described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:

      (1) A transaction request other than an investment election request entered into the TSP record keeping system by a participant who uses the TSP website or the ThriftLine, before 12 noon eastern time of any business day, will ordinarily be posted that business day. A transaction request other than an investment election request entered into the system at or after 12 noon eastern time of any business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day. A transaction request that is an investment election request will ordinarily be posted immediately and be effective the next business day.

      (2) A transaction request made on the TSP website or the ThriftLine on a non-business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day.

      (3) A transaction request made on a paper TSP form will ordinarily be posted under the rules in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, based on when the TSP record keeper enters the form into the TSP system. The TSP record keeper ordinarily enters such forms into the system within 48 hours of their receipt.

      (4) In most cases, the share price(s) applied to a fund reallocation or fund transfer request is the value of the shares on the date the relevant transaction is posted. In some circumstances, such as error correction, the share price(s) for an earlier date will be used.

      (b)  There is no limit on the number of investment election requests. A participant may make a total of two unrestricted fund reallocations and/or fund transfers per account (e.g., civilian or uniformed services), per calendar month. A fund reallocation or fund transfer will count toward the monthly total on the date posted by the TSP record keeper and not on the date requested by a participant. After a participant has made a total of two fund reallocations and/or fund transfers in a calendar month, the participant may make additional fund reallocations or fund transfers only into the G Fund until the first day of the next calendar month.

      § 1601.33   Acknowledgment of risk.

#### § § 1601.33

      (a) Uniformed services participants who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, and who have not elected to be covered by BRS and civilian participants who enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, must execute an acknowledgement of risk in order to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund. If a required acknowledgment of risk has not been executed, no transactions involving the fund(s) for which the acknowledgment is required will be accepted.

      (b) The acknowledgment of risk may be executed in association with an investment election, a fund reallocation, or a fund transfer in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.

      § 1601.34   Error correction.

#### § § 1601.34

      Errors in processing investment elections and fund reallocation or fund transfer requests, or errors that otherwise cause money to be invested in the wrong investment fund, will be corrected in accordance with the error correction regulations found at 5 CFR part 1605.

    Subpart E—Lifecycle Funds

      § 1601.40   Lifecycle Funds.

#### § § 1601.40

      The Executive Director will establish TSP Lifecycle Funds, which are target date asset allocation portfolios. The TSP Lifecycle Funds will invest solely in the funds established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8438(b)(1)(A)-(E).

      § 1601.51   Applicability.

#### § § 1601.51

      § 1601.52   Fund transfers.

#### § § 1601.52

      (a)  A participant may elect to make one or more fund transfers to the mutual fund window from the portion of his or her TSP balance invested in the TSP core funds, subject to the following rules:

      (1) The participant must establish a mutual fund window account that is separate from his or her TSP account. A participant with more than one TSP account may establish a separate mutual fund window account for each TSP account, and the limitations and fees described in subpart will apply separately to each account;

      (2) If the participant does not have an acknowledgment of risk on file as of the date of his or her initial fund transfer request to the mutual fund window, the participant must complete an acknowledgment of risk for the fund transfer to be processed;

      (3) Fund transfers must be made in whole dollar increments (percentages are not permitted);

      (4) The following limitations must be satisfied:

      (i) A participant's initial fund transfer into his or her mutual fund window account must be at least $10,000 and may not exceed 25 percent of the participant's TSP account balance, as of the date of such transfer; and

      (ii) Subsequent fund transfers into a participant's mutual fund window account may not cause the balance in the participant's mutual fund window account to exceed 25 percent of the participant's total TSP balance, as of the date of any such transfer;

      (5) Each fund transfer into the mutual fund window counts toward the monthly limit set forth in § 1601.32(b);

      (6) Amounts transferred to a participant's mutual fund window account will initially be invested in a sweep money market fund. Subsequently, the participant may direct the investment of the transferred amounts into any mutual fund(s) that are available through the mutual fund window;

      (7) Fund transfers are subject to the fees set forth in § 1601.53; and

      (8) A participant may not withdraw funds directly from his or her mutual fund window account. To make a withdrawal, the participant must elect a fund transfer back to the TSP core funds as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Upon completion of such fund transfer, the participant may make a withdrawal in accordance with 5 CFR part 1650.

      (b)  A participant may elect to make a fund transfer to the TSP core funds from amounts invested in his or her mutual fund window account, subject to the following rules:

      (1) Fund transfers must be made in whole dollar increments (percentages are not permitted);

      (2) Amounts to be transferred from a participant's mutual fund window account to the TSP core funds must first be transferred to the sweep money market fund. Subsequently, the participant may direct the investment of the transferred amounts into the TSP core funds;

      (3) Each fund transfer back to the TSP core funds from the mutual fund window account counts toward the monthly limit set forth in § 1601.32(b); except, however, that a participant may always elect a fund transfer from the mutual fund window account to the G Fund; and

      (4) Fund transfers are subject to the fees set forth in § 1601.53.

      (c)  The TSP record keeper will force a transfer from the participant's mutual fund window account to the TSP core funds in the following situations, and subject to the following rules:

      (1) A forced transfer may occur if the balance invested in the TSP core funds is insufficient to cover:

      (i) Amounts necessary to comply with a court order, legal process, or levy described in 5 CFR part 1653;

      (ii) A beneficiary asset transfer;

      (iii) A required minimum distribution;

      (iv) An automatic cash out distribution; or

      (v) Any other payment or transfer that the Board is required by law to make from the participant's TSP account balance;

      (2) The amount of the forced transfer shall be equal to the amount of the insufficiency described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, plus $1,000; except, however, that if the participant's mutual fund window account balance is less than $25,000, the entire mutual fund window account balance shall be transferred to the TSP core funds;

      (3) Forced transfers shall be liquidated from the participant's mutual fund window account first from amounts held in the sweep money market fund; and then from amounts invested in mutual funds, beginning with the position with the highest balance;

      (4) Forced transfers from a participant's mutual fund window account to the TSP core funds shall be invested according to the participant's existing contribution allocation; and

      (5) The participant shall be responsible for any fees incurred as a result of the forced transfer.

      § 1601.53   Fees.

#### § § 1601.53

      (a) The Board will allocate a portion of the TSP's administrative expenses to mutual fund users by charging an administrative fee of $55.00 annually. The amount of this fee will be redetermined once every three years by multiplying the average mutual fund window account balance by the TSP administrative expense ratio, as of the date of redetermination.

      (b) The fee described in paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to any mutual fund window account maintenance fees, trading fees, and fees and expenses associated with the specific mutual fund(s) in which the participant chooses to invest.

      (iv) Delayed agency automatic (1%) contributions.

      are employee contributions that should have been deducted from a participant's basic pay or employer contributions that should have been charged to an employing agency on an earlier date, but were not deducted or charged and, consequently, are being deducted or charged currently.

      § 1605.2   Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on late contributions and loan payments.

#### § § 1605.2

      (a)  The TSP will calculate breakage on late contributions, makeup agency contributions, and loan payments as described by § 1605.15(b). This breakage calculation is subject to the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:

      (1) The TSP record keeper will not calculate breakage if contributions or loan payments are posted within 30 days of the “as of” date, or if the total amount on a late payment record or the total agency contributions on a current payment record is less than $1.00; and

      (2) The TSP record keeper will not take the participant's fund reallocations and fund transfers into account when determining breakage.

      (b)  The TSP record keeper will calculate breakage for all contributions or loan payment corrections as follows:

      (1) Use the participant's investment election on file for the “as of” date to determine how the funds would have been invested, going back to the earliest daily share prices available. If there is no investment election on file, or one cannot be derived based on the investment of contributions, the TSP record keeper will consider the funds to have been invested in the default investment fund in effect for the participant on the “as of” date;

      (2) Determine the number of shares of the applicable investment funds the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the “as of” date is before TSP account balances were converted to shares, this determination will be the number of shares the participant would have received on the conversion date, and will include the daily earnings the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on the “as of” date;

      (3) Determine the dollar value on the posting date of the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the contributions or loan payments would have been invested in a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the posting date, the share price of the L Income Fund will be used. The dollar value shall be the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time multiplied by the share price; and

      (4) The difference between the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the posting date and the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the “as of” date is the breakage.

      (c)  Makeup and late contributions, late loan payments, and breakage, will be posted to the participant's account according to his or her investment election on file for the posting date. If there is no investment election on file for the posting date, they will be posted to the default investment fund in effect for the participant.

      (d)  If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is greater than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution or late loan payment, the TSP record keeper will charge the agency the additional amount. If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is less than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution, or late loan payment, the difference between the amount of the contribution and the amount posted will be forfeited to the TSP.

      (e)  If the TSP record keeper posts multiple makeup or late contributions or late loan payments with different “as of” dates for a participant on the same business day, the amount of breakage charged to the employing agency or forfeited to the TSP will be determined separately for each transaction, without netting any gains or losses attributable to different “as of” dates. In addition, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP core funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, breakage will be determined separately for each as-of date, TSP core fund, and source of contributions.

      § 1605.3   Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on errors involving investment in the wrong fund.

#### § § 1605.3

      (a) The TSP record keeper will calculate and post breakage on date of birth errors that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund, investment election errors, and fund reallocation and fund transfer errors.

      (b) The TSP record keeper will charge the employing agency for positive breakage on incorrect dates of birth caused by employing agency error that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund. A date of birth change received from an employing agency will not trigger corrective action other than to update the date of birth. To initiate a breakage calculation for an employee, the employing agency must notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.

      (c) If a uniformed services participant's retirement system is misclassified and the error results in default investment in the wrong fund, when the error is corrected pursuant to § 1605.14(f)-(g), the TSP record keeper will charge the employing agency for any positive breakage that results from the incorrect default investment. The retirement misclassification correction received from an employing agency will not trigger corrective action other than to update the participant's retirement system coverage. To initiate a breakage calculation for the uniformed service member, the employing agency must notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.

    Subpart B—Employing Agency Errors

      § 1605.11   Makeup of missed or insufficient contributions.

#### § § 1605.11

      (a)  This section applies whenever, as the result of an employing agency error, a participant does not receive all of the TSP contributions to which he or she is entitled. This includes situations in which an employing agency error prevents a participant from making an election to contribute to his or her TSP account, in which an employing agency fails to implement a contribution election properly submitted by a participant, in which an employing agency fails to make agency automatic (1%) contributions or agency matching contributions that it is required to make, or in which an employing agency otherwise erroneously contributes less to the TSP for a participant's account than it should have. The corrections required by this section must be made in accordance with this part and the procedures provided to employing agencies by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper in bulletins or other guidance. It is the responsibility of the employing agency to determine whether it has made an error that entitles a participant to error correction under this section.

      (b)  If an employing agency has failed to make agency automatic contributions that are required under 5 U.S.C. 8432(c)(1)(A) and 5 U.S.C. 8440e(e)(3)(A), or agency matching contributions that are required under section 8432(c)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 8440e(e)(3)(B), the following rules apply:

      (1) The employing agency must promptly submit all missed contributions to the TSP record keeper on behalf of the affected participant. For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate payment record showing the “as of” date for the contributions.

      (2) The TSP record keeper will calculate the breakage due to the participant and post both the contributions and the associated breakage to the participant's account in accordance with § 1605.2.

      (c)  Within 30 days of receiving information from his or her employing agency indicating that the employing agency acknowledges that an error has occurred which has caused a smaller amount of employee contributions to be made to the participant's account than should have been made, a participant may elect to establish a schedule to make up the deficient contributions through future payroll deductions. Employee makeup contributions can be made in addition to any TSP contributions that the participant is otherwise entitled to make. The following rules apply to employee makeup contributions:

      (1) The schedule of makeup contributions elected by the participant must establish the dollar amount of the contributions and the type of employee contributions (traditional or Roth) to be made each pay period over the duration of the schedule. The contribution amount per pay period may vary during the course of the schedule, but the total amount to be contributed must be established when the schedule is created. After the schedule is created, a participant may, with the agreement of his or heremploying agency, elect to change his or her payment amount (e.g., to accelerate payment) or elect to change the type of employee contributions (traditional or Roth). The length of the schedule may not exceed four times the number of pay periods over which the error occurred.

      (2) At its discretion, an employing agency may set a ceiling on the length of a schedule of employee makeup contributions which is less than four times the number of pay periods over which the error occurred. The ceiling may not, however, be less than twice the number of pay periods over which the error occurred.

      (3) The employing agency must implement the participant's schedule of makeup contributions as soon as practicable.

      (4) For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate payment record showing the “as of” date for which the employee contribution should have been made.

      (5) Employee makeup contributions will be invested in accordance with the participant's currentinvestment election. The number of shares of each TSP core fund which will be purchased will be determined by dividing the amount of the makeup contributions by the share price of the applicable fund(s) on the posting date.

      (6) Employee makeup contributions will be included for purposes of applying the annual limit contained in Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) section 402(g) (26 U.S.C. 402(g)(1)). For purposes of applying that limit, employee makeup contributions will be applied against the limit for the year of the “as of” date.

      (i) Before establishing a schedule of employee makeup contributions, the employing agency must review any schedule proposed by the affected participant, as well as the participant's prior TSP contributions, if any, to determine whether the makeup contributions, when combined with prior contributions for the same year, would exceed the annual contribution limit(s) contained in I.R.C. section 402(g) for the year(s) with respect to which the contributions are being made.

      (ii) The employing agency must not permit contributions that, when combined with prior contributions, would exceed the applicable annual contribution limit contained in I.R.C. section 402(g).

      (7) A schedule of employee makeup contributions may be suspended if a participant has insufficient net pay to permit the makeup contributions. If this happens, the period of suspension should not be counted against the maximum number of pay periods to which the participant is entitled in order to complete the schedule of makeup contributions.

      (8) A participant may elect to terminate a schedule of employee makeup contributions at any time, but a termination is irrevocable. If a participant separates from Government service, the participant may elect to accelerate the payment schedule by a lump sum contribution from his or her final paycheck.

      (9) At the same time that a participant makes up missed employee contributions, the employing agency must make any agency matching contributions that would have been made had the error not occurred. Agency matching contributions must be submitted pursuant to the rules set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A participant may not receive agency matching contributions associated with any employee contributions that are not actually made up. If employee makeup contributions are suspended in accordance with paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the payment of agency matching contributions must also be suspended.

      (10) If a participant transfers to an employing agency different from the one by which the participant was employed at the time of the missed contributions, it remains the responsibility of the former employing agency to determine whether employing agency error was responsible for the missed contributions. If it is determined that such an error has occurred, the current agency must take any necessary steps to correct the error. The current agency may seek reimbursement from the former agency of any amount that would have been paid by the former agency had the error not occurred.

      (11) Employee makeup contributions may be made only by payroll deduction from basic pay or, for uniformed services participants, from basic pay, incentive pay, or special pay, including bonus pay. Contributions by check, money order, cash, or other form of payment directly from the participant to the TSP, or from the participant to the employing agency for deposit to the TSP, are not permitted.

      (12) A participant is not eligible to contribute makeup contributions with an “as of” date occurring prior to May 5, 2012 to his or her Roth balance.

      (13) If the “as of” date of a Roth contribution that is submitted as a makeup contribution is earlier than the participant's existing Roth initiation date, the TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's Roth initiation date.

      (d)  This paragraph (d) applies when an employing agency fails to implement a contribution election that was properly submitted by a uniformed service member requesting that a TSP contribution be deducted from bonus pay. Within 30 days of receiving the employing agency's acknowledgment of the error, a uniformed service member may establish a schedule of makeup contributions with his or her employing agency to replace the missed contribution through future payroll deductions. These makeup contributions can be made in addition to any TSP contributions that the uniformed service member is otherwise entitled to make.

      (1) The schedule of makeup contributions may not exceed four times the number of months it would take for the uniformed service member to earn basic pay equal to the dollar amount of the missed contribution. For example, a uniformed service member who earns $29,000 yearly in basic pay and who missed a $2,500 bonus contribution to the TSP can establish a schedule of makeup contributions with a maximum duration of 8 months. This is because it takes the uniformed service member 2 months to earn $2,500 in basic pay (at $2,416.67 per month).

      (2) At its discretion, an employing agency may set a ceiling on the length of a schedule of employee makeup contributions. The ceiling may not, however, be less than twice the number of months it would take for the uniformed service member to earn basic pay equal to the dollar amount of the missed contribution.

      § 1605.12   Removal of erroneous contributions.

#### § § 1605.12

      (a)  This section applies to the removal of funds erroneously contributed to the TSP. This action is called a negative adjustment, and agencies may only request negative adjustments of erroneous contributions made on or after January 1, 2000. Excess contributions addressed by this section include, for example, excess employee contributions that result from employing agency error and excess employer contributions. This section does not address excess contributions resulting from a FERCCA correction; those contributions are addressed in § 1605.14.

      (b)  Negative adjustment records must be submitted by employing agencies in accordance with this part and any other procedures provided by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper.

      (1) To remove money from a participant's account, the employing agency must submit, for each attributable pay date involved, a negative adjustment record stating the attributable pay date and the amount, by source, of the erroneous contribution.

      (2) A negative adjustment record may be for any part of the contributions made for the attributable pay date. However, for each source of contributions, the negative adjustment may not exceed the amount of the contributions made for that date, minus any prior negative adjustments for the same date.

      (c)  To determine current value, a negative adjustment will be allocated among the TSP core funds as it would have been allocated on the attributable pay period (as reported by the employing agency). The TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and TSP core fund:

      (1) If the attributable pay date for the erroneous contribution is on or before the date TSP accounts were converted to shares (and on or after January 1, 2000), the TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and investment fund:

      (i) Determine the dollar value of the amount to be removed by using the daily returns for the applicable TSP core fund;

      (ii) Determine the number of shares that the dollar value determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section would have purchased on the conversion date; and

      (iii) Multiply the price per share for the date the adjustment is posted by the number of shares calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (2) If the attributable pay date of the negative adjustment is after the date TSP accounts were converted to shares, the TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and TSP core fund:

      (i) Determine the number of shares that represent the amount of the contribution to be removed using the share price on the attributable pay date; and

      (ii) Multiply the price per share on the date the adjustment is posted by the number of shares calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. If the contribution was erroneously contributed to a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the date the adjustment is posted, the share price of the L Income Fund will be used.

      (d)  The following rules apply to negative adjustments involving employee contributions:

      (1) If, on the posting date, the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the proposed negative adjustment, the full amount of the adjustment will be removed from the participant's account and returned to the employing agency. Earnings on the erroneous contribution will remain in the participant's account. However, positive earnings on an erroneous contribution to the participant's Roth balance will be moved to the participant's traditional balance;

      (2) If, on the posting date, the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is less than the amount of the proposed negative adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, reduced by the investment loss, will be removed from the participant's account and returned to the employing agency. However, the employing agency must refund to the participant the full amount of the erroneous contribution;

      (3) If an employing agency requests the removal of erroneous employee contributions from a participant's account, it must also request the removal, under paragraph (e) of this section, of any attributable agency matching contributions; and

      (4) If all employee contributions are removed from a participant's account under the rules set forth in this section, the earnings attributable to those contributions will remain in the account until the participant removes them with a TSP withdrawal. If the participant is not eligible to maintain a TSP account, the employing agency must submit an employee data record to the TSP record keeper indicating that the participant has separated from Government service (this will allow the TSP-ineligible participant to make a post-employment distribution election).

      (e)  The following rules apply to negative adjustments involving erroneous employer contributions:

      (1) The amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account.

      (2) Erroneous employer contributions will be returned to the employing agency only if the negative adjustment record is posted by the TSP record keeper within one year of the date the erroneous contribution was posted. If one year or more has elapsed when the negative adjustment record is posted, the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;

      (3) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the full amount of the erroneous contribution. Any earnings attributable to the erroneous contribution will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;

      (4) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted, and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is less than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the amount of the erroneous contribution reduced by the investment loss; and

      (5) An employing agency's obligation to submit negative adjustment records to remove erroneous contributions from a participant's account is not affected by the length of time the contributions have been in the account.

      (f) (1) If multiple negative adjustments for the same attributable pay date for a participant are posted on the same business day, the amount removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses, or returned to the employing agency, will be determined separately for each adjustment. Earnings and losses for erroneous contributions made on different dates will not be netted against each other. In addition, for a negative adjustment for any attributable pay date, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP core funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, for each attributable pay date each source of contributions and each TSP core fund will be treated separately for purposes of these calculations. The amount computed by applying the rules in this section will be removed from the participant's account pro rata from all funds, by source, based on the allocation of the participant's account among the TSP core funds when the transaction is posted; and

      (2) If there is insufficient money in the same source of contributions to cover the amount to be removed or the amount of the requested adjustment, the negative adjustment record will be rejected.

      § 1605.13   Back pay awards and other retroactive pay adjustments.

#### § § 1605.13

      (a)  The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was separated from Government service or was not appointed to a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:

      (1) If the participant is reinstated or retroactively appointed to a hich TSP participation is authorized, immediately upon reinstatement or retroactive appointment the employing agency must give the participant the opportunity to submit a contribution election to make current contributions. The contribution election will be effective as soon as administratively feasible, but no later than the first day of the first full pay period after it is received.

      (2) The employing agency must give a reinstated or retroactively appointed participant the following options for electing makeup contributions:

      (i) The reinstated or retroactively appointed participant may submit a new contribution election for purposes of makeup contributions if he or she would have been eligible to make such an election but for the erroneous separation or erroneous failure to appoint; or

      (ii) If a reinstated participant had a contribution election on file when he or she separated, the contribution election the participant had on file when he or she separated may be reinstated for purposes of makeup contributions.

      (3) All contributions made under this paragraph (a) and associated breakage will be invested according to the participant's investment election on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated using the share prices for the default investment fund in effect for the participant in accordance with § 1605.2 unless otherwise required by the employing agency or the court or other tribunal with jurisdiction over the back pay case.

      (b)  The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was employed in a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:

      (1) The participant will be entitled to make up contributions for the period covered by the back pay award or retroactive pay adjustment only if for that period—

      (i) The participant had designated a percentage of basic pay to be contributed to the TSP; or

      (ii) The participant had designated a dollar amount of contributions each pay period which equaled the applicable ceiling (FERS or CSRS) on contributions per pay period, and which, therefore, was limited as a result of the reduction in pay that is made up by the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment;

      (2) The employing agency must compute the amount of additional employee contributions, agency matching contributions, and agency automatic (1%) contributions that would have been contributed to the participant's account had the reduction in pay leading to the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment not occurred; and

      (3) All contributions under this paragraph (b) and associated breakage will be posted to the participant's account based on the participant's investment election on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated in accordance with § 1605.2.

      (c)  Employee makeup contributions required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

      (1) Must be computed before the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment is paid, deducted from the back pay or other retroactive pay adjustment, and submitted to the TSP record keeper;

      (2) Must not cause the participant to exceed the annual contribution limit(s) contained in sections 402(g), 415(c), or 414(v) of the I.R.C. (26 U.S.C. 402(g), 415(c), 414(v)) for the year(s) with respect to which the contributions are being made, taking into consideration the TSP contributions already made in (or with respect to) that year; and

      (3) Must be accompanied by attributable agency matching contributions. In any event, regardless of whether a participant elects to make up employee contributions, the employing agency must make all appropriate agency automatic (1%) contributions associated with the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment.

      (d)  If a participant has received a post-employment distribution in any form other than an annuity, and the separation from Government service upon which the post-employment distribution was based is reversed, resulting in reinstatement of the participant without a break in service, the participant will have the option to restore the amount distributed to his or her TSP account. The right to restore the distributed funds will expire if the participant does not notify the TSP record keeper within 90 days of reinstatement. If the participant returns the funds that were distributed, the number of shares purchased will be determined by using the share price of the applicable investment fund on the posting date. Restored funds will not incur breakage.

      (e)  Participants who are covered by paragraph (d) of this section and who elect to return funds that were distributed may also elect to reinstate a loan which was previously declared to be a loan foreclosure.

      § 1605.14   Misclassified retirement system coverage.

#### § § 1605.14

      (a) If a CSRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a FERS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:

      (1) Employee contributions that exceed the applicable contribution percentage for the pay period(s) involved may remain in the participant's account. The participant may request the return of excess employee contributions made on or after January 1, 2000; those contributed before January 1, 2000, must remain in the participant's account. If the participant requests a refund of employee contributions, the employing agency must submit a negative adjustment record to remove these funds under the procedure described in § 1605.12.

      (2) All agency contributions that were made to a CSRS participant's account will be forfeited. An employing agency may submit a negative adjustment record to request the return of an erroneous contribution that has been in the participant's account for less than one year.

      (b) If a FERS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a CSRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:

      (1) The participant may not elect to have the contributions made while classified as CSRS removed from his or her account;

      (2) The participant may, under the rules of § 1605.11, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a FERS participant during the period of misclassification;

      (3) The employing agency must, under the rules of § 1605.11, make agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions on employee contributions that were made while the participant was misclassified;

      (4) If the retirement coverage correction is a FERCCA correction, the employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on late payment records. The participant is entitled to breakage on contributions from all sources. Breakage will be calculated pursuant to § 1605.2. If the retirement coverage correction is not a FERCCA correction, the employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on current payment records; in such cases, the employee is not entitled to breakage. Agency makeup contributions may be submitted on either current or late payment records; and

      (5) If employee contributions were made up before the Office of Personnel Management implemented its regulations on FERCCA correction, and the correction is considered to be a FERCCA correction, an amount to replicate TSP lost earnings will be calculated by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to its regulations and provided to the employing agency for transmission to the TSP record keeper.

      (c) If a participant was misclassified as either FERS or CSRS and the retirement coverage is corrected to FICA only, the participant is no longer eligible to participate in the TSP.

      (1) Employee contributions in the account are subject to the rules in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (2) Employer contributions in the account are subject to the rules in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (3) The TSP record keeper will consider a participant to be separated from Government service for all TSP purposes and the employing agency must submit an employee data record to reflect separation from Government service. If the participant has an outstanding loan, it will be subject to the provisions of part 1655 of this chapter. The participant may make a TSP post-employment distribution election pursuant to 5 CFR part 1650, subpart B, and the distribution will be subject to the provisions of 5 CFR 1650.60(b).

      (d) If a FERS or CSRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as FICA only, when the misclassification is corrected the participant may, pursuant to § 1605.11 of this part, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a FERS or CSRS participant during the period of misclassification. If the participant makes up employee contributions, the rules in paragraph (b)(5) of this section apply. If the participant is corrected to FERS, the rules in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section also apply.

      (e) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply to any TSP contributions relating to a period for which an employee elects retroactive Nonappropriated Fund retirement coverage.

      (f) If a BRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a non-BRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:

      (1) The participant may not elect to have the contributions made while classified as non-BRS removed from his or her account;

      (2) The participant may, under the rules of § 1605.11, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a BRS participant during the period of misclassification;

      (3) The employing agency must, under the rules of § 1605.11, make agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions on employee contributions that were made while the participant was misclassified; and

      (4) The employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on current payment records and service makeup contributions may be submitted on either current or late payment records.

      (g) If a non-BRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a BRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:

      (1) Employee contributions may remain in the participant's account. If the participant requests a refund of employee contributions, the employing agency must submit a negative adjustment record to remove these funds under the procedure described in § 1605.12.

      (2) All agency contributions that were made to a non-BRS participant's account will be forfeited. An employing service may submit a negative adjustment record to request the return of an erroneous contribution that has been in the participant's account for less than one year.

#### § § 1605.15

      (a) The employing agency must promptly submit late contributions to the TSP record keeper on behalf of the affected participant on late payment records as soon as the error is discovered. For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate record showing the “as of” date for the contributions. Breakage for both employee and agency contributions will be calculated, posted, and charged to the agency or forfeited to the TSP in accordance with § 1605.2.

      (b) If an employing agency deducts loan payments from a participant's pay, but fails to submit those payments to the TSP record keeper for the pay date for which they were deducted (or submits them in a manner that prevents them from being timely credited to the participant's account), the employing agency will be responsible for paying breakage using the procedure described in § 1605.2. The loan payment record must contain the “as of” date for which the loan payment was deducted.

      (c) All contributions or loan payments on payment records contained in a payroll submission that was received from an employing agency more than 30 days after the pay date associated with the payroll submission (as reported on the appropriate journal voucher), will be subject to breakage calculated, posted, and charged to the employing agency (or forfeited to the TSP) in accordance with § 1605.2. The employing agency will be apprised of the breakage due for each record reported on the late submission.

      (d) If the “as of” date of a late Roth contribution is earlier than the participant's existing Roth initiation date, the TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's Roth initiation date.

      § 1605.16   Claims for correction of employing agency errors; time limitations.

#### § § 1605.16

      (a)

      (1) Upon discovery of an error made within the past six months involving the correct or timely remittance of payments to the TSP record keeper (other than a retirement system misclassification error, as covered in paragraph (c) of this section), an employing agency must promptly correct the error on its own initiative. If the error was made more than six months before it was discovered, the agency may exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct it, but, in any event, the agency must act promptly in doing so.

      (2) For errors involving incorrect dates of birth caused by employing agency error that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund, the employing agency must promptly notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage if the error is discovered within 30 days of either the date the TSP record keeper provides the participant with a notice reflecting the error or the date the TSP or its record keeper makes available on its website a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. If it is discovered after that time, the employing agency may use its sound discretion in deciding whether to pay breakage, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.

      (b)  (1) If an agency fails to discover an error of which a participant has knowledge involving the correct or timely remittance of a payment to the TSP record keeper (other than a retirement system misclassification error as covered by paragraph (c) of this section), the participant may file a claim with his or her employing agency to have the error corrected without a time limit. The agency must promptly correct any such error for which the participant files a claim within six months of its occurrence; if the participant files a claim to correct any such error after that time, the agency may do so at its sound discretion.

      (2) For errors involving incorrect dates of birth that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge, he or she may file a claim for breakage with the employing agency no later than 30 days after either the date the TSP record keeper provides the participant with a notice reflecting the error or the date the TSP or its record keeper makes available on its website a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. The employing agency must promptly notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.

      (3) If a participant or beneficiary fails to file a claim for breakage for errors involving incorrect dates of birth in a timely manner, the employing agency may nevertheless, in its sound discretion, pay breakage on any such error that is brought to its attention.

      (c)  Errors arising from retirement system misclassification must be corrected no matter when they are discovered, whether by an agency or a participant.

      (d)  Each employing agency must establish procedures for participants to submit claims for correction under this subpart. Each employing agency's procedures must include the following:

      (1) The employing agency must provide the participant with a decision on any claim within 30 days of its receipt, unless the employing agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring a longer period to decide the claim. A decision to deny a claim in whole or in part must be in writing and must include the reasons for the denial, citations to any applicable statutes, regulations, or procedures, a description of any additional material that would enable the participant to perfect the claim, and a statement of the steps necessary to appeal the denial;

      (2) The employing agency must permit a participant at least 30 days to appeal the employing agency's denial of all or any part of a claim for correction under this subpart. The appeal must be in writing and addressed to the agency official designated in the initial decision or in procedures promulgated by the agency. The participant may include with his or her appeal any documentation or comments that the participant deems relevant to the claim;

      (3) The employing agency must issue a written decision on a timely appeal within 30 days of receipt of the appeal, unless the employing agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring a longer period to decide the appeal. The employing agency decision must include the reasons for the decision, as well as citations to any applicable statutes, regulations, or procedures; and

      (4) If the agency decision on the appeal is not issued in a timely manner, or if the appeal is denied in whole or in part, the participant will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies and will be eligible to file suit against the employing agency under 5 U.S.C. 8477. There is no administrative appeal to the Board of a final agency decision.

      § 1605.17   Redesignation and recharacterization.

#### § § 1605.17

      (a)  This section applies to the redesignation of contributions which, due to employing agency error, were contributed to the participant's traditional balance when they should have been contributed to the participant's Roth balance or were contributed to the participant's Roth balance when they should have been contributed to the participant's traditional balance. This section also applies to the recharacterization of contributions which, due to employing agency error, were contributed as tax-deferred contributions when they should have been contributed as tax-exempt contributions (or vice versa). It is the responsibility of the employing agency to determine whether it has made an error that entitles a participant to error correction under this section.

      (b)  The employing agency must promptly submit a redesignation record or a recharacterization record in accordance with this part and the procedures provided to employing agencies by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper in bulletins or other guidance.

      (c)  (1) Upon receipt of a properly submitted redesignation record, the TSP record keeper shall treat the erroneously submitted contribution (and associated positive earnings) as if the contribution had been made to the correct balance on the date that it was contributed to the wrong balance. The TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's traditional balance and the participant's Roth balance accordingly. The TSP record keeper will also adjust the participant's Roth initiation date as necessary.

      (2) Upon receipt of a properly submitted recharacterization record or recharacterization request, the TSP record keeper will update the tax characterization of the erroneously characterized contribution.

      (3) Agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions cannot be redesignated as Roth contributions or recharacterized as tax-exempt contributions.

      (4) There is no breakage associated with redesignation or recharacterization actions.

    Subpart C—Board or TSP Record Keeper Errors

      § 1605.21   Plan-paid breakage and other corrections.

#### § § 1605.21

      (a)  (1) Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if, because of an error committed by the Board or the TSP record keeper, a participant's account is not credited or charged with the investment gains or losses the account would have received had the error not occurred, the account will be credited accordingly.

      (2) Errors that warrant the crediting of breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to:

      (i) Delay in crediting contributions or other money to a participant's account;

      (ii) Improper issuance of a loan or TSP withdrawal payment to a participant or beneficiary which requires the money to be restored to the participant's account; and

      (iii) Investment of all or part of a participant's account in the wrong investment fund(s).

      (3) A participant will not be entitled to breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the participant had the use of the money on which the investment gains would have accrued.

      (4) If the participant continued to have a TSP account, or would have continued to have a TSP account but for the Board or TSP record keeper's error, the TSP record keeper will compute gains or losses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the relevant period based upon the investment funds in which the affected money would have been invested had the error not occurred. If the participant did not have, and should not have had, a TSP account during this period, then the TSP will use the rate of return set forth in § 1605.2(b) for the relevant period and return the money to the participant.

      (b)  The Executive Director may, in his or her discretion and consistent with the requirements of applicable law, correct any other errors not specifically addressed in this section, including payment of breakage, if the Executive Director determines that the correction would serve the interests of justice and fairness and equity among all participants of the TSP.

      § 1605.22   Claims for correction of Board or TSP record keeper errors; time limitations.

#### § § 1605.22

      (a)  Claims for correction of Board or TSP record keeper errors under this subpart may be submitted initially either to the TSP record keeper or the Board. The claim must be in writing and may be from the affected participant or beneficiary.

      (b)  (1) Upon discovery of an error made within the past six months involving a receipt or a disbursement, the Board or TSP record keeper must promptly correct the error on its own initiative. If the error was made more than six months before its discovery, the Board or the TSP record keeper may exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct the error, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.

      (2) For errors involving an investment in the wrong fund caused by Board or TSP record keeper error, the Board or the TSP record keeper must promptly pay breakage if it is discovered within 30 days of the issuance of the most recent TSP participant (or loan) statement, transaction confirmation, or other notice that reflected the error, whichever is earlier. If it is discovered after that time, the Board or TSP record keeper may use its sound discretion in deciding whether to pay breakage, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.

      (c)  (1) If the Board or TSP record keeper fails to discover an error of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge involving a receipt or a disbursement, the participant or beneficiary may file a claim for correction of the error with the Board or the TSP record keeper without time limit. The Board or the TSP record keeper must promptly correct any such error for which the participant or beneficiary filed a claim within six months of its occurrence; the correction of any such error for which the participant or beneficiary filed a claim after that time is in the sound discretion of the Board or TSP record keeper.

      (2) For errors involving an investment in the wrong fund of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge, he or she may file a claim for breakage with the Board or TSP record keeper no later than 30 days after the TSP provides the participant with a transaction confirmation or other notice reflecting the error, or makes available on its Web site a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. The Board or TSP record keeper must promptly pay breakage for such errors.

      (3) If a participant or beneficiary fails to file a claim for breakage concerning an error involving an investment in the wrong fund in a timely manner, the Board or TSP record keeper may nevertheless, in its sound discretion, pay breakage for any such error that is brought to its attention.

      (d)  (1) If the initial claim is submitted to the TSP record keeper, the TSP record keeper may either respond directly to the claimant, or may forward the claim to the Board for response. If the TSP record keeper responds to a claim, and all or any part of the claim is denied, the claimant may request review by the Board within 90 days of the date of the TSP record keeper's response.

      (2) If the Board denies all or any part of a claim (whether upon review of a TSP record keeper denial or upon an initial review by the Board), the claimant will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedy and may file suit under 5 U.S.C. 8477. If the claimant does not submit a request to the Board for review of a claim denial by the TSP record keeper within the 90 days permitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the claimant will be deemed to have accepted the TSP record keeper's decision.

      (a)  This section applies to employees who meet the conditions specified at 5 CFR 1620.40 and who are eligible to make up employee contributions or to receive employing agency contributions missed as a result of military service.

      (b)  An employee who separates or enters nonpay status to perform military service may be eligible to make up TSP contributions when he or she is reemployed or restored to pay status in the civilian service. Eligibility for making up missed employee contributions will be determined in accordance with the rules specified at 5 CFR part 1620, subpart E. Missed employee contributions must be made up in accordance with the rules set out in § 1605.11(c) and 5 CFR 1620.42.

      (c)  This paragraph (c) applies only to an employee who would have been eligible to receive agency contributions had he or she remained in civilian service or pay status. A FERS employee who separates or enters nonpay status to perform military service is eligible to receive agency makeup contributions when he or she is reemployed or restored to pay status in the civilian service, as follows:

      (1) The employee is entitled to receive the agency automatic (1%) contributions that he or she would have received had he or she remained in civilian service or pay status. Within 60 days of the employee's reemployment or restoration to pay status, the employing agency must calculate the makeup agency automatic (1%) contributions and report those contributions to the record keeper, subject to any reduction in agency automatic (1%) contributions required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

      (2) An employee who contributed to a uniformed services TSP account during the period of military service is also immediately entitled to receive makeup agency matching contributions to his or her civilian account for the employee contributions to the uniformed services account that were deducted from his or her basic pay, subject to any reduction in agency matching contributions required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section. However, an employee is not entitled to receive makeup agency matching makeup contributions on contributions that were deducted from his or her incentive pay or special pay, including bonus pay, while performing military service.

      (3) An employee who makes up missed contributions is entitled to receive attributable makeup agency matching contributions (unless the employee has already received the maximum amount of matching contributions, as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (4) of this section).

      (4) If the employee received uniformed services agency matching contributions, the makeup agency matching contributions will be reduced by the amount of the uniformed services agency matching contributions.

      (5) If the employee received uniformed services agency automatic (1%) contributions, the agency automatic (1%) contributions will be reduced by the amount of the uniformed services agency automatic (1%) contributions.

      (d)  The employee is entitled to breakage on agency contributions made under paragraph (c) of this section. Breakage will be calculated based on the investment election(s) on file for the participant during the period of military service.

On various occasions, Congress has since expanded TSP eligibility to other groups. Depending on the circumstances, that subsequent legislation requires retroactive contributions or provides other special features. Where necessary, this part describes those special features. The employees and employing agencies covered by this part are also governed by the other regulations in 5 CFR chapter VI to the extent that they do not conflict with the regulations of this part.

#### § § 1620.44

      If an employee's agency automatic (1%) contributions were forfeited because the employee was not vested when he or she separated to perform military service, the employee must notify the employing agency that a forfeiture occurred.

      § 1620.45   Suspending TSP loans, restoring post-employment distributions, and reversing loan foreclosures..

#### § § 1620.45

      (a)  If the TSP record keeper is notified that an employee entered into a nonpay status to perform military service, any outstanding TSP loan from a civilian TSP account will be suspended, that is, it will not be declared a loan foreclosure while the employee is performing military service.

      (1) Interest will accrue on the loan balance during the period of suspension. When the employee returns to civilian pay status, the employing agency will resume deducting loan payments from the participant's basic pay and the TSP record keeper will reamortize the loan (which will include interest accrued during the period of military service). The maximum loan repayment term will be extended by the employee's period of military service. Consequently, when the employee returns to pay status, the TSP record keeper must receive documentation to show the beginning and ending dates of military service.

      (2) The TSP record keeper may close the loan account and declare it to be a loan foreclosure if the TSP record keeper does not receive documentation that the employee entered into nonpay status. However, this can be reversed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (b)  An employee who separates from civilian service to perform military service and who receives an automatic payment pursuant to § 1650.11 may return to the TSP an amount equal to the amount of the payment. The employee must notify the TSP record keeper of his or her intent to return the distributed funds within 90 days of the date the employee returns to civilian service or pay status; if the employee is eligible to return a distribution, the TSP record keeper will then inform the employee of the actions that must be taken to return the funds.

      (c)  An employee may request that a loan foreclosure be reversed it resulted from the employee's separation or placement in nonpay status to perform military service. The TSP record keeper will reverse the loan foreclosure under the process described as follows:

      (1) An employee who received a post-employment distribution when he or she separated to perform military service can have a loan foreclosure reversed only if the distributed amount is returned as described in paragraph (b) of this section;

      (2) A loan foreclosure can be reversed either by reinstating the loan or by repaying it in full. The TSP loan can be reinstated only if the employee agrees to repay the loan within the maximum loan repayment term plus the length of military service, and if, after reinstatement of the loan, the employee will have no more than two outstanding loans, only one of which is a residential loan; and

      (3) The employee must notify the TSP record keeper of his or her intent to reverse a loan foreclosure within 90 days of the date the employee returns to civilian service or pay status; if the employee is eligible to reverse a loan foreclosure, the TSP record keeper will then inform the employee of the actions that must be taken to reverse the distribution.

      (d)  Employees will not receive breakage on amounts returned to their accounts under this section.

> [87 FR 31679, May 24, 2022]

      § 1620.46   Agency responsibilities.

#### § § 1620.46

      (a)  Each employing agency must establish procedures for implementing these regulations. These procedures must at a minimum require agency personnel to identify eligible employees and notify them of their options under these regulations and the time period within which these options must be exercised.

      (b)  The agency making payments to the record keeper for all contributions and attributable breakage will obtain from prior employing agencies whatever information is necessary to make accurate payments. If a prior employing agency is ultimately chargeable under § 1620.43(b) for all or part of this expense, the agency making the payments to the TSP record keeper will determine the procedure to follow in order to collect amounts owed to it by the agency ultimately chargeable with the expense.

      (c)  Agencies will, with the employee's consent, prepare a payment schedule for making retroactive employee contributions which will be consistent with the procedures established at 5 CFR part 1605 for the correction of employing agency errors.

      (d)  Employing agencies must calculate the agency automatic (1%) contributions for all reemployed (or restored) FERS employees and report those contributions to the TSP record keeper within 60 days of reemployment.

      (e)  When notified by an employee that a forfeiture of the agency automatic (1%) contributions occurred after the employee separated to perform military service, the employing agency must complete and file the appropriate paper TSP form with the TSP record keeper in accordance with the form's instructions to have those funds restored.

      (f)  The agencies must include the period of military service in the Thrift Savings Plan Service Computation Date (TSP-SCD) of all reemployed FERS employees. If the period of military service has not been credited, the agencies must submit an employee data record to the TSP record keeper containing the correct TSP Service Computation Date.

    (4) Corrections to TSP account records which are made by the Board, its recordkeeper or the employing agency or the former employing agency on its own motion because of a detected administrative error will be effected without reference to Privacy Act procedures.

    (5) A participant in the TSP who is currently employed by a Federal agency should be aware that the employing agency provides to the Board personal and payroll records on the participant, such as his or her date of birth, Social Security number, retirement code, address, loan repayments, the amount of participant's contribution, amount of the Government's contribution, if the participant is covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA, 5 U.S.C. Chapter 84), and adjustments to contributions. Requests submitted to the Board, or its recordkeeper, to correct information provided by the employing Federal agency will be referred to the employing agency. The reason for this referral is that the Board receives information periodically for the TSP accounts; if the employing agency does not resolve the alleged error, the Board will continue to receive the uncorrected information periodically regardless of a one-time Board correction. The employing agency also has custody of the election form (which is maintained in the Official Personnel Folder). Requests for amendment or correction of records described in this paragraph should be made to the employing agency.

    (b)  (1) Any other individual who wants to correct or amend a record pertaining to him or her shall submit a written request to the Board's Privacy Act Officer whose address is listed in § 1630.4. The words “Privacy Act—Request to Amend Record” should be written on the letter and the envelope.

    (2) The request for amendment or correction of the record should, if possible, state the exact name of the system of records as published in the ; a precise description of the record proposed for amendment; a brief statement describing the information the requester believes to be inaccurate or incomplete, and why; and the amendment or correction desired. If the request to amend the record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record in accordance with §§ 1630.4, 1630.5, 1630.6 or § 1630.7, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and the Board should be attached, if possible.

    (3) If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, the Board may require documentation of identification as described in § 1630.7.

A copy of the transmittal letter will be sent to the requester.

    (b) For non-TSP records, the Privacy Act Officer will acknowledge a request for amendment of a record within 10 work days of the date the Board receives it.

#### § § 1630.13

    (a) Individuals who disagree with the refusal to grant them access to or to amend a record about them should submit a written request for review to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The words “PRIVACY ACT—APPEAL” should be written on the letter and the envelope. Individuals who need assistance preparing their appeal should contact the Board's Privacy Act Officer.

    (b) The appeal letter must be received by the Board within 30 calendar days from the date the requester received the notice of denial. At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:

    (1) The records involved;

    (2) The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of the record;

    (3) The date of the Board's denial of that request; and

    (4) The reasons supporting the request for reversal of the Board's decision.

    (c) The Board reserves the right to dispose of correspondence concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review of the Board's decision is received within 180 days of the decision date. Therefore, a request for review received after 180 days may, at the discretion of the Privacy Act Officer, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.

If a final decision cannot be made in 20 work days, the Privacy Act Officer will inform the requester of the reasons for the delay and the date on which a final decision can be expected. Such extensions are unusual, and should not exceed an additional 30 work days.

    (b) If the original request was for access and the initial determination is reversed, the procedures in § 1630.7 will be followed. If the initial determination is upheld, the requester will be so informed and advised of the right to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).

    (c) If the initial denial of a request to amend a record is reversed, the Board or the record keeper will correct the record as requested and inform the individual of the correction. If the original decision is upheld, the requester will be informed and notified in writing of the right to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) and the right to file a concise statement of disagreement with the Executive Director. The statement of disagreement should include an explanation of why the requester believes the record is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The Executive Director shall maintain the statement of disagreement with the disputed record, and shall include a copy of the statement of disagreement to any person or agency to whom the record has been disclosed, if the disclosure was made pursuant to § 1630.9.

      (c) When a request is not considered reasonably descriptive, or requires the production of voluminous records, or places an extraordinary burden on the Board, seriously interfering with its normal functioning to the detriment of the Thrift Savings Plan, the Board may require the person or agent making the FOIA request to confer with a Board representative in order to attempt to verify, and, if possible, narrow the scope of the request.

      (d) Upon initial receipt of the FOIA request, the FOIA Officer will determine which official or officials within the Board shall have the primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing the requested information and drafting a proposed response.

      (e) Any Board employee or official who receives a FOIA request shall promptly forward it to the FOIA Officer, at the above address.

      (g) To demonstrate compelling need in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the requester must submit a written statement that contains a certification that the information provided therein is true and accurate to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The statement must demonstrate that:

      (1) The failure to obtain the record on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (2) The requester is a person primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, and there is an urgent need to inform the public concerning an actual or alleged Federal Government activity that is the subject of the request.

Whenever the Board cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Board extends the time limit on that basis, the Board must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Board estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Board must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request through the Board's FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA Officer.

      (c) When additional time is required for one of the reasons stated in paragraph (b) of this section, the FOIA Officer will extend this time period for an additional 10 work days by written notice to the requester.

(A Federal court does not have jurisdiction to review a denial of a request for expedited processing after the Board has provided a complete response to the request.) The denial will also inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the FOIA Officer's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requestor will be notified of that determination in writing.

      (f) No personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing will ordinarily be permitted in connection with an appeal of a request for expedited processing or an appeal for records.

      (g) On appeal of a request concerning records, the Executive Director may reduce any fees previously assessed.

      (h) Seeking mediation and dispute resolution services through OGIS is a voluntary process. If the requestor chooses to use these services, the Board will work with OGIS to resolve disputes between requestors and the Board as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

      (i) Before seeking review by a court of the FOIA Officer's adverse determination, a requestor generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal to the Executive Director.

      § 1631.11   Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.

#### § § 1631.11

      (a) In general, the Board will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees there are three categories of FOIA requestors—commercial use requestors, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requestors.

      (1) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are requested for commercial use. Commercial users are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The full allowable direct cost of searching for, and reviewing records will be charged even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records. A commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Board's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Board will notify requesters of their placement in this category.

      (2) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by a representative of the news media. A representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The Board will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (3) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research. A noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. The Board will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (4) For any request which does not meet the criteria contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. If computer search time is required, the first two hours of computer search time will be based on the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 23.5 percent. When the cost of the computer search, including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process the request, equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search,  the operator, the Board shall begin assessing charges for computer search. Requests from individuals requesting records about themselves filed in the Board's systems of records shall continue to be treated under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for reproduction. The Board's fee schedule is set out in § 1631.14 of this part.

      (b) Except for requests that are for a commercial use, the Board may not charge for the first two hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction. However, a requestor may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Board believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Board may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. For example, it would be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period had been made to avoid fees. For requests made over a long period, however, the Board must have a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in such cases. Before aggregating requests from more than one requester, the Board must have a reasonable basis on which to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees. In no case may the Board aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.

      (c) In accordance with the prohibition of section (4)(A)(iv) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, the Board shall not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.

      (1) For commercial use requesters, if the direct cost of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.

      (2) For requests from representatives of news media or educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, excluding the first 100 pages which are provided at no charge, if the duplication cost would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.

      (3) For all other requests not falling within the category of commercial use requests, representatives of news media, or educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, if the direct cost of searching for and duplicating the records sought, excluding the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages which are free of charge, would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.

      (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, the Board will not assess any search fees (or duplication fees for requesters under (a)(2) or (3) of this section) if the Board fails to comply with the time limits set forth in § 1631.8.

      (1) If the Board determines that “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, apply and the Board provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1631.8, the Board is excused for an additional 10 days from the restrictions of this section.

      (2) If the Board has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Board may charge search fees (or duplication fees for requesters under (a)(2) or (3) of this section) if the Board provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1631.8 and the Board has discussed with the requester, or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so, how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.

      (3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined in the FOIA, the Agency's delay shall be excused in accordance with the court order.

> [55 FR 41052, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 41708, Aug. 5, 1998; 82 FR 24827, May 31, 2017]

      § 1631.12   Waiver or reduction of fees.

#### § § 1631.12

      (a) The Board may waive all fees or levy a reduced fee when disclosure of the information requested is deemed to be in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Board or Federal Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making its decision on waiving or reducing fees, the Board will consider the following factors:

      (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Board or the Government,

      (2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Government operations or activities (including those of the Board),

      (3) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of TSP or Government operations or activities,

      (4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and

      (5) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (b) A fee waiver request must indicate the existence and magnitude of any commercial interest that the requester has in the records that are the subject of the request.

      § 1631.13   Prepayment of fees over $250.

#### § § 1631.13

      (a) When the Board estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the Board may require a requester to make an advance payment of the entire fee before continuing to process the request.

      (b) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion ( within 30 calendar days of the date of the billing), the Board may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in § 1631.14(d), and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.

      (c) When the Board acts under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA ( 20 working days from the receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Board has received fee payments under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

> [55 FR 41052, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 41709, Aug. 5, 1998]

      § 1631.14   Fee schedule.

#### § § 1631.14

      (a)  The Board will charge at the salary rate(s) plus 23.5 percent (to cover benefits) of the employee(s) conducting the search. The Board may assess charges for time spend searching, even if the Board fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.

      (b)  The Board will charge the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary, plus 23.5 percent, apportionable to the search. The Board may assess charges for time spent searching, even if the Board fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.

      (c)  (1) For copies of documents reproduced on a standard office copying machine in sizes up to 8  × 14 inches, the charge will be $.15 per page.

      (2) The fee for reproducing copies of records over 8  × 14 inches, or whose physical characteristics do not permit reproduction by routine electrostatic copying, shall be the direct cost of reproducing the records through Government or commercial sources. If the Board estimates that the allowable duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester had indicated in advance his/her willingness to pay fees as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the objective of reformulating the request to meet his/her needs at a lower cost.

      (3) For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes, printouts, or CD's the Board shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of producing the tapes, printouts, or CD's. If the Board estimates that the allowable duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his/her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the objective of reformulating the request to meet his/her needs at a lower cost.

      (4) For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the Board shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s). If the Board estimates that the allowable duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his/her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the objective of reformulating the request to meet his/her needs at a lower cost.

      (d) Interest may be charged to those requesters who fail to pay fees charged. The Board may begin assessing interest charges on the amount billed starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code, and it will accrue from the date of the billing.

      (e) The Board shall use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA. The Board may choose to contract with private sector services to locate, reproduce, and disseminate records in response to FOIA requests when that is the most efficient and least costly method. When documents responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, such as, but not limited to, the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service, the Board will inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from those sources.

      § 1631.15   Information to be disclosed.

#### § § 1631.15

      (a) In general, all records of the Board are available to the public, as required by the Freedom of Information Act. However, the Board claims the right, where it is applicable, to withhold material under the provisions specified in the Freedom of Information Act as amended (5 U.S.C. 552(b)). Nevertheless, the Board will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever full disclosure of the record is not and take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information.

      (b)  (1)(i) Board personnel will generally consider two of the nine exemptions in the FOIA in deciding whether to withhold from disclosure material from a non-U.S. Government source.

      (ii) Exemption 4 permits withholding of “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person as privileged or confidential.” The term “person” refers to individuals as well as to a wide range of entities, including corporations, banks, state governments, agencies of foreign governments, and Native American tribes or nations, who provide information to the government. Exemption 6 permits withholding certain information, the disclosure of which ”would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”

      (2)(i)  Commencing January 1, 1988, the submitter of confidential commercial information must, at the time the information is submitted to the Board or within 30 calendar days of such submission, designate any information the disclosure of which the submitter claims could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm. The submitter as part of its submission, must explain the rationale for the designation of the information as commercial and confidential.

      (ii) Confidential commercial information means records provided to the Board by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

      (iii) After January 1, 1988, a submitter who does not designate portions of a submission as confidential commercial information waives that basis for nondisclosure unless the Board determines that it has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the requested records would result in substantial harm to the competitive position of the submitter.

      (3) When the Board determines that it has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the requested records would result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter, and has no designation from the submitter, it shall notify the submitter of the following:

      (i) That a FOIA request has been received seeking the record,

      (ii) That disclosure of the record may be required,

      (iii) That disclosure of the record could result in competitive harm to the submitter,

      (iv) That the submitter has a period of seven workdays from date of notice within which it or a designee may object to the disclosure its records, and

      (v) That a detailed explanation should be submitted setting forth all grounds as to why the disclosure would result in substantial competitive harm, such as, the general custom or usage in the business of the information in the record, the number and situation of the persons who have access to the record, the type and degree of risk of financial injury that release would cause, and the length of time the record needs to be kept confidential.

      (4) In exceptional circumstances, the Board may extend by seven workdays the time for a submitter's response for good cause.

      (5) The Board shall give careful consideration to all specified grounds for nondisclosure prior to making an administrative determination on the issue of competitive harm.

      (6) Should the Board determine to disclose the requested records, it shall provide written notice to the submitter, explaining briefly why the submitter's objections were not sustained and setting forth the date for disclosure, which date may be less than 10 calendar days after the date of the letter to the submitter.

      (7) A submitter who provided records to the Board prior to January 1, 1988, and did not designate which records contain confidential commercial information, shall be notified as provided in § 1631.15(b)(3). After making such notification, the Board will follow the procedures set forth in § 1631.15(b)(4)-(6).

      (8) The Board will, as a general rule, look favorably upon recommendations for withholding information about ideas, methods, and processes that are unique; about equipment, materials, or systems that are potentially patentable; or about a unique use of equipment which is specifically outlined.

      (9) The Board will not withhold information that is known through custom or usage in the relevant trade, business, or profession, or information that is generally known to any reasonably educated person. Self-evident statements or reviews of the general state of the art will not ordinarily be withheld.

      (10) The Board will withhold all cost data submitted, except the total estimated costs from each year of a contract. It will release these total estimated costs and ordinarily release explanatory material and headings associated with the cost data, withholding only the figures themselves. If a contractor believes that some of the explanatory material should be withheld, that material must be identified and a justification be presented as to why it should not be released.

      (11)  This exemption is not a blanket exemption for all personal information submitted by a non-U.S. Government source. The Board will balance the need to keep a person's private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny with the public's right to information on Board records. As a general practice, the Board will release information about any person named in a contract itself or about any person who signed a contract as well as information given in a proposal about any officer of a corporation submitting that proposal. Depending upon the circumstances, the Board may release most information in resumes concerning employees, including education and experience. Efforts will be made to identify information that should be deleted and offerors are urged to point out such material for guidance. Any information in the proposal, such as the names of staff persons, which might, if released, constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if released should be identified and a justification for non-release provided in order to receive proper consideration.

      § 1631.16   Exemptions.

#### § § 1631.16

      The Freedom of Information Act exempts from all of its publication and disclosure requirements nine categories of records which are described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b). These categories include such matters as national defense and foreign policy information, investigatory files, internal procedures and communications, materials exempted from disclosure by other statutes, information given in confidence and matters involving personal privacy.

#### § § 1631.17

      Where requested records contain matters which are exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) but which matters are reasonably segregable from the remainder of the records, they shall be disclosed by the Board with deletions. To each such record, the Board shall indicate, if technically feasible, the precise amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made, at the place in the records where the deletion is made, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.

      (b) Materials that are identified as responsive to a FOIA request will not be disposed of or destroyed while the request or a related appeal of lawsuit is pending. This is true even if they would otherwise be authorized for disposition under the Board's General Records Schedule of NARA or other NARA-approved records schedule.

#### § § 1631.33

      (a) The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to an appropriate demand or request. Among the relevant factors that the General Counsel may consider in making this decision are whether:

      (2) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of Thrift Savings Plan participants and beneficiaries;

      (3) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;

      (4) The Board has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;

      (5) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Board employee to serve as an expert witness for a private interest;

      (6) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Board employee to testify as to a matter of law;

      (7) Disclosure would result in the Board appearing to favor one private litigant over another private litigant;

      (8) Disclosure relates to documents that were produced by another government agency; and

      (9) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose.

      (b) The factors listed in paragraph (a) of this section are illustrative and not exhaustive.

      § 1631.34   Filing requirements for demands or requests for testimony.

#### § § 1631.34

      You must comply with the following requirements whenever you send a demand or request for testimony to the Board or a Board employee. If you serve a subpoena on the Board or a Board employee that is not accompanied by a written request that complies with the requirements in this section, the General Counsel may oppose the subpoena on grounds that your request was not submitted in accordance with this subpart.

      (a) Your request must be in writing and must contain the following information:

      (1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved.

      (2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show relevance;

      (3) A specific description of the substance of the testimony sought;

      (4) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than a Board employee, such as a retained expert;

      (5) An explanation as to why no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;

      (6) If oral testimony is sought, an explanation as to why a written declaration or affidavit cannot be used in lieu of oral testimony;

      (7) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested testimony;

      (8) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case; and

      (9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties will require with each Board employee for time spent by the employee to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.

      (b) The Board reserves the right to require additional information to complete your request where appropriate.

      (c) Your request should be submitted at least 45 days before the date that the testimony is required. Requests submitted in less than 45 days before testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for requesting expedited processing.

      (d) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with your request.

      § 1631.35   Certification (authentication) of copies of records.

#### § § 1631.35

      The Board may certify that copies of records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. The records custodian or other qualified individual shall certify copies of books, records, papers, writings, and documents by attaching a written declaration that complies with current Federal Rules of Evidence. No seal or notarization shall be required.

      § 1631.36   Fees.

#### § § 1631.36

    § 1636.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1636.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1636.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1636.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1636.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1636.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1636.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1636.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 1636.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1636.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

#### § § 1636.160

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1636.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.

    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.

    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—

    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;

    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and

    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.

    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by § 1636.170(g). The agency may extend this time for good cause.

The Board will assess an annual rate of interest that is equal to the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury ( the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the  and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins, unless a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of the Board. The Board will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the Board's interests.

Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Board.

      (d)  A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding administrative costs, second to penalty assessments, third to accrued interest, and then to the outstanding debt principal.

      (e)  (1) The Executive Director may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty, or administrative costs, if he determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the Board.

      (2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Executive Director's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.

      § 1639.9   Charges pending waiver or review.

#### § § 1639.9

      Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will continue to accrue on a debt during administrative appeal, either formal or informal, and during waiver consideration by the Board, unless specifically prohibited by a statute or a regulation.

#### § § 1639.10

      The Executive Director will refer to the Department of Justice for litigation all claims on which aggressive collection actions have been taken but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended, or terminated. Referrals will be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive Board collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor.

      § 1639.12   Deposit of funds collected.

#### § § 1639.12

      All funds owed to the Board and collected under this part will be deposited in the Thrift Savings Fund. Funds owed to other agencies and collected under this part will be credited to the account designated by the creditor agency for the receipt of the funds.

      § 1639.13   Antialienation of funds in Thrift Savings Plan participant accounts.

#### § § 1639.13

      In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8437, net assets available for Thrift Savings Plan benefits will not be used to satisfy a debt owed by a participant to an agency under the regulations of this part or under the debt collection regulations of any agency.

      (f) The right to a hearing conducted by an administrative law judge or other impartial hearing official ( a hearing official not under the supervision or control of the Executive Director), with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed or the repayment schedule ( the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period), so long as a request is filed by the employee as prescribed in § 1639.23;

      (g) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Board) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the Executive Director;

      (h) The name, address, and telephone number of an officer or employee of the Board who may be contacted concerning procedures for requesting a hearing;

      (i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;

      (j) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following receipt of the notice of intent will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

      (k) The name and address of the officer or employee of the Board to whom the request for a hearing should be sent;

      (l) That the Board will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset, as appropriate, (which may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay) not less than 30 days from the date the employee receives the notice of debt, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;

      (m) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

      (n) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

      (1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statute or regulations;

      (2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, or any other applicable statutory authority; and

      (q) That proceedings with respect to the debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.

      § 1639.23   Hearing.

#### § § 1639.23

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee who desires a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed offset schedule must send such a request to the Board office designated in the notice of intent. See § 1639.22(k).

      (1) The request for hearing must be signed by the employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that support his or her position.

      (2) The request for hearing must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th calendar day following the employee's receipt of the notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures.

      (3) The employee must also specify whether an oral or written hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.

      (b)  (1) If the employee files a request for a hearing after the expiration of the 15th calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of a failure to receive notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee had actual notice of the filing deadline).

      (2) An employee waives the right to a hearing, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the Board's offset schedule, if the employee:

      (i) Fails to file a request for a hearing and the failure is not excused; or

      (ii) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified and the hearing official does not determine that failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

      (c)  The creditor agency may be represented by legal counsel. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her own expense.

      (d)  (1) In accordance with § 1639.22(e), an employee who intends to inspect or copy Board records related to the debt must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be received within 15 calendar days after the employee's receipt of the notice.

      (2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.

      (3) If personal inspection is impractical, arrangements will be made to send copies of those records to the employee.

      (e)  The Board may request an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing or the Board may obtain a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Executive Director.

      (f) —(1)  After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official will notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be written, the employee will be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record will be closed. This date will give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.

      (2)  An employee who requests an oral hearing will be provided an oral hearing, if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:

      (i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument;

      (ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee; or

      (iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.

      (3)  If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record.

      (4)  The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart.

      (g)  The hearing official will issue a written decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practical after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the petition was received by the creditor agency, unless the employee requests a delay in the proceedings. In that case, the 60 day decision period will be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.

      (h)  The written decision will include:

      (1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

      (2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and

      (3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.

      (i)  (1) In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing will be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent.

      (2) If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official will proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented by the representative(s) of the employee and the documentary documentation submitted by both parties.

      (3) At the request of both parties, the hearing official will schedule a new hearing date. Both parties will be given reasonable notice of the time and place of this new hearing.

      § 1639.24   Certification.

#### § § 1639.24

      (a) The Board will provide a certification to the paying agency in all cases in which:

      (1) The hearing official determines that a debt exists;

      (2) The employee admits the existence and amount of the debt by failing to request a hearing; or

      (3) The employee admits the existence of the debt by failing to appear at a hearing.

      (b) The certification must be in writing and must include:

      (1) A statement that the employee owes the debt;

      (2) The amount and basis of the debt;

      (3) The date the Board's right to collect the debt first accrued;

      (4) A statement that the Board's regulations have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K;

      (5) The amount and date of the collection, if only a one-time offset is required;

      (6) If the collection is to be made in installments, the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required; and

      (7) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the dates of notices and hearings provided to the employee, or, if applicable, the employee's signed consent to salary offset or a signed statement acknowledging receipt of required procedures.

      § 1639.25   Voluntary repayment agreements as alternative to salary offset.

#### § § 1639.25

      (a) In response to a notice of intent to offset against an employee's salary to recover a debt owed to the Board, an employee may propose to the Board that he or she be allowed to repay the debt through direct payments as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset must submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal must admit the existence of the debt and set forth a proposed repayment schedule. The employee's proposal must be received by the official designated in the notice of intent within 15 calendar days after the employee received the notice.

      (b) In response to a timely proposal by the debtor, the Executive Director will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the Executive Director's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by salary offset.

      (c) If the Executive Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 days from the date he or she received notice of the decision to file a petition for a hearing.

      (d) If the Executive Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrange ment must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the Executive Director.

      § 1639.26   Special review.

#### § § 1639.26

      (a) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement in connection with a debt owed to the Board may, at any time, request that the Board conduct a special review of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances, such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.

      (b) To assist the Board in determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee will submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:

      (1) Income from all sources;

      (2) Assets;

      (3) Liabilities;

      (4) Number of dependents;

      (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;

      (6) Medical expenses; and

      (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.

      (c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee must file an alternative proposed salary offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.

      (d) The Executive Director will evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Executive Director will notify the employee in writing of his determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.

      (e) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Board will provide a new certification to the paying agency.

      § 1639.27   Procedures for salary offset.

#### § § 1639.27

      (a) The Board will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart.

      (b) The Board's payroll office will determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.

      (c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by the Board's payroll office of certification for the creditor agency.

      (d) Types of collection—

      (1)  If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.

      (2)  Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.

      (3)  A deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR chapter II, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.

      (4)  If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Board, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Board may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR chapter II.

      (e) Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Board's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.

      (f) Precedence of debts owed to the Board. For Board employees, debts owed to the Board generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event that a debt to the Board is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the Board may decide whether to have the first debt repaid in full before collecting the claim or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Board can be collected in one pay period, the Board payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the debt to the Board. When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Board will be the primary con sideration in the payroll office's determination of the order in which the debts should be collected.

      § 1639.28   Coordinating salary offset with other agencies.

#### § § 1639.28

      (a)  (1) The Board will coordinate debt collections with other agencies and will, as appropriate:

      (i) Arrange for a hearing or special review upon proper petitioning by the debtor; and

      (ii) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, the additional practices and procedures that may be necessary to carry out the intent of this subpart.

      (2) The Board will ensure:

      (i) That each notice of intent to offset is consistent with the requirements of § 1639.22;

      (ii) That each certification of debt that is sent to a paying agency is consistent with the requirements of § 1639.24; and

      (iii) That hearings are properly scheduled.

      (3)  Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Board will provide the paying agency with a certification as provided in § 1639.24.

      (4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, the Board must submit a debt claim to the paying agency for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and the Board. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal Government sources, the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Board must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making the payments before the collection can be made.

      (5)  If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Board may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR part 831, subpart R, or 5 CFR part 845, subpart D) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt.

      (6)  When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, the Board will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. The Board will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

      (b) —(1)  When the Board receives a certified claim from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, the employee will receive a written notice from the Board including:

      (i) A statement that the Board has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency;

      (ii) The amount of the debt claim;

      (iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin, and

      (iv) The amount of such deductions.

      (2)  When the Board receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Board will return the debt claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, must be followed and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.

      (3)  The Board is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.

      (4)  If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Board, the employee transfers from the Board to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Board will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.

      § 1639.29   Refunds.

#### § § 1639.29

      (a) If the Board is the creditor agency, it will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:

      (1) The debt is waived or all or part of the funds deducted are otherwise found not to be owed; or

      (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Board to make a refund.

      (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section will not bear interest.

      § 1639.30   Non-waiver of rights by payments.

#### § § 1639.30

      An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under this subpart must not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provisions of a written contract or law, unless there are statutory or con tractual provisions to the contrary.

    Subpart C—Tax Refund Offset

      § 1639.40   Applicability and scope.

#### § § 1639.40

      (a) The regulations in this subpart implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the Department of the Treasury to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency.

      (4) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Board against amounts payable to the debtor by the Board;

      (5) With respect to which the Board has given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by the debtor, and has determined that an amount of the debt is past due and legally enforceable;

      (6) Which has been disclosed by the Board to a credit reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), unless the credit reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c;

      (7) With respect to which the Board has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor that:

      (i) The debt is past due, and

      (ii) Unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the Department of the Treasury for offset against any overpayment of tax; and

      (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of Treasury regulations relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.

      § 1639.41   Procedures for tax refund offset.

#### § § 1639.41

      (a) The Board will be the point of contact with the Department of the Treasury for administrative matters regarding the offset program.

      (b) The Board will ensure that the procedures prescribed by the Department of the Treasury are followed in developing information about past-due debts and submitting the debts to the IRS.

      (c) The Board will submit a notification of a taxpayer's liability for past-due legally enforceable debt to the Department of the Treasury which will contain:

      (1) The name and taxpayer identifying number (as defined in section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6109) of the person who is responsible for the debt;

      (2) The dollar amount of the past-due and legally enforceable debt;

      (3) The date on which the original debt became past due;

      (4) A statement certifying that, with respect to each debt reported, all of the requirements of eligibility of the debt for referral for the refund offset have been satisfied. See § 1639.40(b).

      (d) The Board shall promptly notify the Department of the Treasury to correct Board data submitted when it:

      (1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to a debt that has been referred;

      (2) Receives or credits a payment on the debt; or

      (3) Receives notice that the person owing the debt has filed for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.

      (e) When advising debtors of an intent to refer a debt to the Department of the Treasury for offset, the Board will also advise the debtors of all remedial actions available to defer or prevent the offset from taking place.

      § 1639.42   Notice requirements before tax refund offset.

#### § § 1639.42

      (a) The Board must notify, or make a reasonable attempt to notify, the person:

      (1) The amount of the debt and that the debt is past due; and

      (c) The Board will give the individual debtor at least 60 days from the date of the notice to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable. The Board will consider the evidence presented by the individual and will make a determination whether any amount of the debt is past due and legally enforceable. For purposes of this section, evidence that collection of the debt is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving the individual will bar referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury.

      (d) Notice given to a debtor under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall advise the debtor of how he or she may present evidence to the Board that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable. Such evidence may not be referred to, or considered by, individuals who are not officials, employees, or agents of the United States in making the determination required under paragraph (c) of this section. Unless such evidence is directly considered by an official or employee of the Board, and the determination required under paragraph (c) of this section has been made by an official or employee of the Board, any unresolved dispute with the debtor regarding whether all or part of the debt is past due or legally enforceable must be referred to the Board for ultimate administrative disposition, and the Board must directly notify the debtor of its determination.

    Subpart D—Administrative Offset

      § 1639.50   Applicability and scope.

#### § § 1639.50

      (a) The regulations in this subpart apply to the collection of debts owed to the Board, or from a request for an offset received by the Board from a Federal agency. Administrative offset is authorized under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716). The regulations in this subpart are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on administrative offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3.

      (b) The Executive Director, after attempting to collect a debt owed to the Board under section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset, subject to the following:

      (1) The debt is certain in amount; and

      (2) It is in the best interest of the Board to collect the debt by administrative offset because of the decreased costs of collection and acceleration in the payment of the debt.

      (c) The Executive Director may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to a Federal agency, so long as the funds to be offset are not payable from net assets available for Thrift Savings Plan benefits. The head of the creditor agency, or his or her designee, must submit a written request for the offset with a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.

      (d) The Executive Director may request another agency that holds funds payable to a Fund debtor to pay the funds to the Board in settlement of the debt. The Board will provide certification that:

      (1) The debt exists; and

      (2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.

      (e) If the six-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such an action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt.

      (f) No collection by administrative offset will be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Board or a Federal agency's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting the debt.

      (g) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to:

      (1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute; or

      (2) Debts owed to the Board by Federal agencies or by any State or local government.

      § 1639.51   Notice procedures.

#### § § 1639.51

      Before collecting any debt through administrative offset, the Board will send a notice of intent to offset to the debtor by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the most current address that is available to the Board. The notice will provide:

      (a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of the Board to collect the debt through administrative offset;

      (b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Board with respect to the debt;

      (c) An opportunity for review within the Board of the determination of the Board with respect to the debt; and

      (d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for repaying the amount of the debt.

      § 1639.52   Board review.

#### § § 1639.52

      (a) A debtor may dispute the existence of the debt, the amount of debt, or the terms of repayment. A request to review a disputed debt must be submitted to the Board official who provided the notice of intent to offset within 30 calendar days of the debtor's receipt of the written notice described in § 1639.51.

      (b) If the debtor requests an opportunity to inspect or copy the Board's records concerning the disputed claim, the Board will grant 10 business days for the review. The time period will be measured from the time the request for inspection is granted or from the time the debtor receives a copy of the records.

      (c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions in any of the debtor's account(s) maintained in the Board may be temporarily suspended to the extent of the debt that is owed. Depending on the type of transaction, the suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the payment of interest or discount due on the transaction. Should the dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be immediately lifted.

      (d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue.

      (e) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review within the time specified in this section or if, as a result of the review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement is executed, then administrative offset will be ordered in accordance with the regulations in this subpart without further notice.

      § 1639.53   Written agreement for repayment.

#### § § 1639.53

      A debtor who admits liability but elects not to have the debt collected by administrative offset will be afforded an opportunity to negotiate a written agreement for repaying the debt. If the financial condition of the debtor does not support the ability to pay in one lump sum, the Board may consider reasonable installments. No installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business days of the Board's request for the statement. At the Board's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be required for installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 31 U.S.C. 3711.

      § 1639.54   Requests for offset to Federal agencies.

#### § § 1639.54

      The Executive Director may request that funds due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency be paid to the Board in payment of a debt owed to the Board by that debtor. In requesting administrative offset, the Board, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor:

      (a) That the debtor owes the debt;

      (b) The amount and basis of the debt; and

      (c) That the Board has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations in this subpart, and the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the debtor with due process.

      § 1639.55   Requests for offset from Federal agencies.

#### § § 1639.55

      Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Board be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to that agency by the debtor, so long as the funds are not payable from net assets available for Thrift Savings Plan benefits. The Board will initiate the requested offset only:

      (a) Upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:

      (1) That the debtor owes the debt;

      (2) The amount and basis of the debt;

      (3) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and

      (4) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102, including providing any required hearing or review; and

      (b) Upon a determination by the Board that collection by offset against funds payable by the Board would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.

      § 1639.56   Expedited procedure.

#### § § 1639.56

      The Board may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor before completion of the procedures required by §§ 1639.51 and 1639.52 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize the Board's ability to collect the debt and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. An expedited offset will be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset, but later found not to be owed to the Board, will be promptly refunded.

      (a)  The Board may use administrative wage garnishment to collect debts from non-Federal employees in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This subpart adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f).

#### § § 1645.5

    (a)  The share price for each TSP core fund for each business day will apply to all sources of contributions for that fund. The total net earnings (as computed under § 1645.3) for each fund will be divided by the total fund basis (as computed under § 1645.6) for that fund. The resulting number, computed to ten decimal places, represents the incremental change in the value of that fund from the last business day to the current business day. The share price for that fund for the current business day is the sum of the incremental change in the share price for the current business day plus the share price for the prior business day, truncated to four decimal places.

    (b)  When the total net earnings for each business day for each TSP Fund are divided by the total fund basis in that fund, there will be residual net earnings attributable to the truncation described in paragraph (a) of this section which will not be included in the incremental change in the share price of the fund for that business day. The residual net earnings that are not included in the incremental share price for the fund may be added to the earnings for that fund on the next business day.

      § 1650.2   Eligibility and general rules for a TSP withdrawal.

#### § § 1650.2

      (a) A participant who is separated from Government service can elect a distribution of all or a portion of his or her account balance by one or a combination of the distribution methods described in subpart B of this part.

      (b) A post-employment distribution will not be paid unless TSP records indicate that the participant is separated from Government service. The TSP record keeper will, when possible, cancel a pending post-employment distribution election upon receiving information from an employing agency that a participant is no longer separated.

      (c) A participant cannot make a full post-employment distribution of his or her account until any outstanding TSP loan has either been repaid in full or declared to be a loan foreclosure. An outstanding TSP loan will not affect a participant's eligibility for a partial post-employment distribution or an in-service withdrawal.

      (d) A separated participant who is reemployed in a position in which he or she is eligible to participate in the TSP is subject to the following rules:

      (1) A participant who is reemployed in a TSP-eligible position on or before the 31st full calendar day after separation is not eligible to withdraw his or her TSP account in accordance with subpart B of this part.

      (2) A participant who is reemployed in a TSP-eligible position more than 31 full calendar days after separation and who made a post-employment withdrawal while separated may not withdraw any remaining portion of his or her account balance in accordance with subpart B of this part until he or she again separates from Government service.

      (e) A participant who has not separated from Government service may be eligible to withdraw all or a portion of his or her account in accordance with subparts D and E of this part.

      (f) A participant can elect to have any portion of a single or installment payment that is not rolled over to an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA deposited directly, by electronic funds transfer (EFT), into a savings or checking account at a financial institution in the United States.

      (g) If a participant has a civilian TSP account and a uniformed services TSP account, the rules in this part apply to each account separately. For example, the participant is eligible to make four age-based in-service withdrawals from the civilian account and four age-based in-service withdrawals from the uniformed services account per calendar year. A separate withdrawal request must be made for each account.

      (h) A participant may elect to have his or her TSP withdrawal distributed from the participant's traditional balance only, Roth balance only, or pro rata from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. Any distribution from the traditional balance will be prorated between the tax-deferred balance and any tax-exempt balance. Any distribution from the Roth balance will be prorated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, all TSP withdrawals will be distributed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the participant's account is invested. All prorated amounts will be based on the balances in each TSP core fund or source of contributions on the day the TSP withdrawal is processed.

      (b) A participant may not take a distribution of any portion of his or her account balance if the account is frozen due to a pending retirement benefits court order, an alimony or child support enforcement order, or a child abuse enforcement order, or because a freeze has been placed on the account by the TSP record keeper for another reason.

#### § § 1650.5

      If a TSP withdrawal is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 90 days, the returned funds will be forfeited to the TSP. The participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.

#### § § 1650.6

      (a) The TSP record keeper will cancel a pending TSP withdrawal request if it receives notice, in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper, that a participant is deceased. The TSP record keeper will also cancel an annuity purchase made on or after the participant's date of death but before annuity payments have begun, and the annuity vendor will return the funds to the TSP.

      (b) If the TSP record keeper processes a TSP withdrawal request before being notified that a participant is deceased, the funds cannot be returned to the TSP.

#### § § 1650.11

      (a) Subject to the restrictions in this subpart, participants may elect a distribution of all or a portion of their TSP accounts in a single payment, a series of installment payments, a life annuity, or any combination of these options.

      (b) If a participant's account balance is less than $5.00 when he or she separates from Government service, the balance will automatically be forfeited to the TSP. The participant can reclaim the money by contacting the TSP record keeper and requesting the amount that was forfeited; however, TSP investment earnings will not be credited to the account after the date of the forfeiture.

      (c) Provided that the participant has not submitted a post-employment distribution election prior to the date the automatic payment is processed, if a participant's vested account balance is less than $200 when he or she separates from Government service, the TSP record keeper will automatically pay the balance in a single payment to the participant at his or her TSP address of record. The participant will not be eligible for any other payment option or be allowed to remain in the TSP.

#### § § 1650.12

      § 1650.13   Installment payments.

#### § § 1650.13

      (a) A participant can elect a distribution of all or a portion of the account balance in a series of substantially equal installment payments, to be paid on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis in one of the following manners:

      (1)  The amount elected must be at least $25 per installment; if the amount elected is less than $25 per installment, the request will be rejected. Payments will be made in the amount requested each installment period.

      (2) An installment payment amount calculated based on life expectancy. Payments based on life expectancy are determined using the factors set forth in the Internal Revenue Service life expectancy tables codified at 26 CFR 1.401(a)(9)-9(b) and (c). The installment payment amount is calculated by dividing the account balance by the factor from the IRS life expectancy tables based upon the participant's age as of his or her birthday in the year payments are to begin. This amount is then divided by the number of installment payments to be made per calendar year to yield the installment payment amount. In subsequent years, the installment payment amount is recalculated in January by dividing the prior December 31 account balance by the factor in the IRS life expectancy tables based upon the participant's age as of his or her birthday in the year payments will be made. There is no minimum amount for an installment payment calculated based on this method.

      (b) A participant can make the following changes at any time as described in § 1650.17(c):

      (1) A participant receiving installment payments calculated based on life expectancy can elect to change to fixed dollar installment payments;

      (2) A participant receiving installment payments based on a fixed dollar amount can elect to stop these payments and make a new election to receive installment payments calculated based on life expectancy;

      (3) A participant receiving installment payments based on a fixed dollar amount can elect to change the amount of his or her fixed payments; and

      (4) A participant receiving fixed dollar installment payments can elect to change the frequency of his or her installment payments.

      (c) If a participant elects to receive installments pro rata from his or her traditional and Roth balances, installment payments will be made until the participant's entire account balance is expended, unless the participant elects to change or stop installment payments as described in in § 1650.17(c). If a participant elects to receive installment payments from his or her traditional balance only or Roth balance only, installment payments will automatically continue from the non-elected balance once the elected balance has been expended, unless the participant elects to change or stop installment payments as described in § 1650.17(c).

      (d) A participant receiving installment payments, regardless of the calculation method, can elect at any time to receive the remainder or part of his or her account balance in a single payment.

      (e) A participant may only have one installment payment series in place at a time.

      (f) A participant receiving installment payments may change the investment of his or her account balance among the TSP core funds and may invest through the mutual fund window as provided in 5 CFR part 1601.

      (g) Upon receiving information from an employing agency that a participant receiving installment payments is no longer separated, the TSP record keeper will cancel all pending and future installment payments.

      § 1650.14   Annuities.

#### § § 1650.14

      (a) A participant electing a post-employment distribution can use all or a portion of his or her total account balance, traditional balance only, or Roth balance only to purchase a life annuity.

      (b) If a participant has a traditional balance and a Roth balance and elects to use all or a portion of his or her total account balance to purchase a life annuity, the TSP record keeper must purchase two separate annuity contracts for the participant: One from the portion of the withdrawal distributed from his or her traditional balance and one from the portion of the withdrawal distributed from his or her Roth balance.

      (c) A participant cannot elect to purchase an annuity contract with less than $3,500.

      (d) Unless an amount must be paid directly to the participant to satisfy any applicable minimum distribution requirement of the Internal Revenue Code, the TSP record keeper will purchase the annuity contract(s) from the TSP's annuity vendor using the participant's entire account balance or the portion specified. In the event that a minimum distribution is required by section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code before the date of the first annuity payment, the TSP record keeper will compute that amount prior to purchasing the annuity contract(s) and pay it directly to the participant.

      (e) An annuity will provide a payment for life to the participant and, if applicable, to the participant's survivor, in accordance with the type of annuity chosen. The TSP annuity vendor will make the first annuity payment approximately 30 days after the TSP record keeper purchases the annuity.

      (f) The amount of an annuity payment will depend on the type of annuity chosen, the participant's age when the annuity is purchased (and the age of the joint annuitant, if applicable), the amount used to purchase the annuity, and the interest rate available when the annuity is purchased.

      (g) Participants may choose among the following types of annuities:

      (1)  This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant as long as the participant lives. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant.

      (2)  This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant, as long as both the participant and spouse are alive, and monthly payments to the survivor, as long as the survivor is alive. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant, although the amount received will depend on the type of survivor benefit elected.

      (3)  This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant as long as both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive, and monthly payments to the survivor as long as the survivor is alive. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant. The joint annuitant must be either a former spouse or a person who has an insurable interest in the participant.

      (i) A person has an “insurable interest in the participant” if the person is financially dependent on the participant and could reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the participant's continued life.

      (ii) A relative (either blood or adopted, but not by marriage) who is closer than a first cousin is presumed to have an insurable interest in the participant.

      (iii) A participant can establish that a person not described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section has an insurable interest in him or her by submitting, with the annuity request, an affidavit from a person other than the participant or the joint annuitant that demonstrates that the designated joint annuitant has an insurable interest in the participant (as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section).

      (4)  This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant only, or to the participant and spouse, as applicable. The monthly payments are increased once each year on the anniversary of the first payment by a fixed rate of 2 percent. If the participant chooses a joint life annuity, the annual 2 percent increase also applies to benefits received by the survivor.

      (h) For each distribution election in which the participant elects to purchase an annuity with some or all of the amount distributed, if the TSP record keeper must purchase two annuity contracts, the type of annuity, the annuity features, and the joint annuitant (if applicable) selected by the participant will apply to both annuities purchased. For each distribution election, a participant cannot elect more than one type of annuity by which to receive a distribution, or portion thereof, from any one account.

      (i) A participant who chooses a joint life annuity (with a spouse, a former spouse, or a person with an insurable interest) must choose either a 50 percent or a 100 percent survivor benefit. The survivor benefit applies when either the participant or the joint annuitant dies.

      (1) A 50 percent survivor benefit provides a monthly payment to the survivor which is 50 percent of the amount of the payment that is made when both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive.

      (2) A 100 percent survivor benefit provides a monthly payment to the survivor, which is equal to the amount of the payment that is made when both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive.

      (3) Either the 50 percent or the 100 percent survivor benefit may be combined with any joint life annuity option. However, the 100 percent survivor benefit can only be combined with a joint annuity with a person other than the spouse (or a former spouse, if required by a retirement benefits court order) if the joint annuitant is not more than 10 years younger than the participant.

      (j) The following features are mutually exclusive, but can be combined with certain types of annuities, as indicated:

      (1)  This feature provides that, if the participant (and joint annuitant, where applicable) dies before an amount equal to the balance used to purchase the annuity has been paid out, the difference between the balance used to purchase the annuity and the sum of monthly payments already made will be paid to the beneficiary(ies) designated by the participant (or by the joint annuitant, where applicable). This feature can be combined with any type of annuity.

      (2)  This feature provides that, if the participant dies before annuity payments have been made for 10 years (120 payments), monthly payments will be made to the beneficiary(ies) until 120 payments have been made. This feature can be combined with any single life annuity, but cannot be combined with a joint life annuity.

      (k) Once an annuity has been purchased, the type of annuity, the annuity features, and the identity of the joint annuitant cannot be changed, and the annuity cannot be terminated.

      § 1650.16   Required minimum distributions.

#### § § 1650.16

      (a) A separated participant must receive required minimum distributions from his or her account commencing no later than the required beginning date and, for each year thereafter, no later than December 31.

      (b) A separated participant may elect to withdraw from his or her account or to begin receiving payments before the required beginning date, but is not required to do so.

      (c) In the event that a separated participant does not withdraw from his or her account an amount sufficient to satisfy his or her required minimum distribution for the year, the TSP record keeper will automatically distribute the necessary amount on or before the applicable date described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d) [Reserved]

      (e) The rules set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall apply to a separated participant who reclaims an account balance that was declared abandoned.

      § 1650.17   Changes and cancellation of a post-employment distribution request.

#### § § 1650.17

      (a)  A pending post-employment distribution request can be cancelled if the cancellation is received and can be processed before the TSP record keeper processes the request. However, the TSP record keeper processes post-employment distribution requests each business day and those that are entered into the record keeping system by 12 noon eastern time will ordinarily be processed that night; those entered after 12 noon eastern time will be processed the next business day. Consequently, a cancellation request must be received and entered into the system before the cut-off for the day the request is submitted for processing in order to be effective to cancel the post-employment distribution.

      (b)  A post-employment distribution election cannot be changed or cancelled after the withdrawal request has been processed. Consequently, funds disbursed cannot be returned to the TSP.

      (c)  If a participant is receiving a series of installment payments, with appropriate supporting documentation as required by the TSP record keeper, the participant can change at any time: The payment amount or frequency (including stopping installment payments), the address to which the payments are mailed, the amount of federal tax withholding, whether or not a payment will be rolled over (if permitted) and the portion to be rolled over, the method by which direct payments to the participant are being sent (EFT or check), the identity of the financial institution to which payments are rolled over or sent directly to the participant by EFT, or the identity of the EFT account.

    Subpart C—Procedures for Post-Employment Distributions

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 31683, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1650.21   Information provided by employing agency or service.

#### § § 1650.21

      When a TSP participant separates from Government service, his or her employing agency or service must report the separation and the date of separation to the TSP record keeper. Until the TSP record keeper receives this information from the employing agency or service, it will not pay a post-employment distribution.

      § 1650.22   Accounts of $200 or more.

#### § § 1650.22

      A participant whose account balance is $200 or more must submit a properly completed distribution election to request a post-employment distribution of his or her account balance.

      § 1650.23   Accounts of less than $200.

#### § § 1650.23

      Upon receiving information from the employing agency that a participant has been separated for more than 60 days and that any outstanding loans have been closed, provided the participant has not made a distribution election before the distribution is processed, if the account balance is $5.00 or more but less than $200, the TSP record keeper will automatically distribute the entire amount of his or her account balance. The TSP record keeper will not pay this amount by EFT. The participant may not elect to leave this amount in the TSP, nor will the TSP record keeper roll over any automatically distributed amount to an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA. However, the participant may make an indirect rollover of this payment into an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA to the extent the roll over is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

      § 1650.24   How to obtain a post-employment distribution.

#### § § 1650.24

      To request a post-employment distribution, a participant must initiate a request in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.

      § 1650.25   Rollovers from the TSP.

#### § § 1650.25

      (a) The TSP record keeper will, at the participant's election, roll over all or any portion of an eligible rollover distribution (as defined by section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code) directly to an eligible employer plan or an IRA.

      (b) If a post-employment distribution includes a payment from a participant's traditional balance and a payment from the participant's Roth balance, the TSP record keeper will, at the participant's election, roll over all or a portion of the payment from the traditional balance to a single plan or IRA and all or a portion of the payment from the Roth balance to another plan or IRA. The TSP record keeper will also allow the traditional and Roth portions of a payment to be rolled over to the same plan or IRA but, for each type of balance, the election must be made separately by the participant and each type of balance will be rolled over separately. However, the TSP record keeper will not roll over portions of the participant's traditional balance to two different institutions or portions of the participant's Roth balance to two different institutions.

      (c) If a post-employment distribution includes an amount from a participant's Roth balance and the participant elects to roll over that amount to another eligible employer plan or Roth IRA, the TSP record keeper will inform the plan administrator or trustee of the start date of the participant's Roth 5 year non-exclusion period or the participant's Roth initiation date, and the portion of the distribution that represents Roth contributions. If a post-employment distribution includes an amount from a participant's Roth balance and the participant does not elect to roll over the amount, the TSP record keeper will inform the participant of the portion of the distribution that represents Roth contributions.

      (d) Tax-exempt contributions can be rolled over only if the IRA or plan accepts such funds.

      (e) The TSP record keeper will roll over distributions only to the extent that the rollover is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

    Subpart D—In-Service Withdrawals

      § 1650.31   Age-based withdrawals.

#### § § 1650.31

      (a) A participant who has reached age 59  and who has not separated from Government service is eligible to withdraw all or a portion of his or her vested TSP account balance in a single payment. Unless the withdrawal request is for the entire vested account balance, the entire vested traditional balance, or the entire vested Roth balance, the amount of an age-based withdrawal request must be at least $1,000.

      (b) An age-based withdrawal is an eligible rollover distribution, so a participant may request that the TSP record keeper roll over all or a portion of the withdrawal to a traditional IRA, an eligible employer plan, or a Roth IRA in accordance with § 1650.25.

      (c) A participant is permitted four age-based withdrawals per calendar year for an account. Only one age-based withdrawal election per account will be processed in any 30-calendar-day-period.

      (c) A participant is permitted four age-based withdrawals per calendar year for an account.

      § 1650.32   Financial hardship withdrawals.

#### § § 1650.32

      (a) A participant who has not separated from Government service and who can certify that he or she has a financial hardship is eligible to withdraw all or a portion of his or her own contributions to the TSP (and their attributable earnings) in a single payment to meet certain specified financial obligations. The amount of a financial hardship withdrawal request must be at least $1,000.

      (b) To be eligible for a financial hardship withdrawal, a participant must have a financial need that results from at least one of the following five conditions:

      (1) The participant's monthly cash flow is negative ( the participant's income is less than his or her monthly expenses on a recurring basis);

      (2) The participant has incurred medical expenses as a result of a medical condition, illness, or injury to the participant, the participant's spouse, or the participant's dependents. Generally, eligible expenses are those that would be eligible for deduction as medical expenses for Federal income tax purposes. Eligible medical expenses include the cost of household improvements required as a result of a medical condition, illness or injury. Household improvements are structural improvements to the participant's living quarters or the installation of special equipment that is necessary to accommodate the circumstances of the incapacitated person.

      (3) The participant must have paid the cost of repair or replacement resulting from a personal casualty loss that would be eligible for deduction for Federal income tax purposes, but without regard to the IRS income limitations on deductibility, fair market value of the property, or number of events. Personal casualty loss includes damage, destruction, or loss of property resulting from a sudden, unexpected, or unusual event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, storm, fire, or theft.

      (4) The participant must have paid attorney fees and court costs associated with separation or divorce. Court-ordered payments to a spouse or former spouse and child support payments are not allowed, nor are costs of obtaining prepaid legal services or other coverage for legal services.

      (5) The participant has incurred expenses and losses (including loss of income) on account of a disaster declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 100-707, provided that the participant's principal residence or principal place of employment at the time of the disaster was located in an area designated by FEMA for individual assistance with respect to the disaster.

      (c) When determining financial hardship needs, a participant cannot use any expenses that are already paid or are reimbursable to the participant by insurance or otherwise.

      (d) The amount of a participant's financial hardship withdrawal cannot exceed the smallest of the following:

      (1) The amount requested; or

      (2) The amount in the participant's account that is equal to his or her own contributions and attributable earnings.

      (e) The participant must certify that he or she has a financial hardship as described on the hardship withdrawal request, and that the dollar amount of the withdrawal request does not exceed the actual amount of the financial hardship.

      (f) A participant is not eligible for an in-service hardship withdrawal based solely on monthly negative cash flow (as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) during the time he or she has pending a petition in bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. chapter 13).

    Subpart G—Spousal Rights

      § 1650.61   Spousal rights applicable to post-employment withdrawals.

#### § § 1650.61

      (a) The spousal rights described in this section apply to total post-employment distributions when the married participant's vested TSP account balance exceeds $3,500, to partial post-employment distributions without regard to the amount of the participant's account balance, and to any change in the amount or frequency of an existing installment payment series, including a change from payments calculated based on life expectancy to payments based on a fixed-dollar amount.

      (b) Unless the participant was granted an exception under this subpart to the spousal notification requirement within 90 days of the date the distribution request is processed by the TSP record keeper, the spouse of a CSRS participant is entitled to notice when the participant applies for a post-employment distribution or makes a change to the amount or frequency of an existing installment payment series. The participant must provide the TSP record keeper with the spouse's correct email or physical address to which to send the required notice.

      (c) The spouse of a FERS or uniformed services participant has a right to a joint and survivor annuity with a 50 percent survivor benefit, level payments, and no cash refund based on the participant's entire account balance when the participant elects a total post-employment distribution.

      (1) The participant may make a different total post-employment distribution election only if his or her spouse consents to that election and waives the right to this annuity.

      (2) A participant's spouse must consent to any partial post-employment distribution election (other than an election to purchase this type of an annuity with such amount) and waive his or her right to this annuity with respect the amount distributed.

      (3) A spouse must consent to any change in the amount or frequency of an existing installment payment series and waive his or her right to this annuity with respect to the applicable amount. Spousal consent is not required to stop installment payments.

      (4) Unless the participant was granted an exception under this subpart to the spousal consent requirement within 90 days of the date the distribution request is processed by the TSP record keeper, to show that the spouse has consented to a different total or partial post-employment distribution election or installment payment change and waived the right to this annuity with respect to the applicable amount, the participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a properly completed distribution request, signed by his or her spouse.

      (5) The spouse's consent and waiver is irrevocable for the applicable distribution or installment payment change once the TSP record keeper has received it.

      (a) The spousal rights described in this section apply to all in-service withdrawals and do not depend on the amount of the participant's vested account balance or the amount requested for withdrawal.

      (b) Unless the participant was granted an exception under this subpart to the spousal notification requirement within 90 days of the date on which the withdrawal request is processed by the TSP record keeper, the spouse of a CSRS participant is entitled to notice when the participant applies for an in-service withdrawal. The participant must provide the TSP record keeper with the spouse's correct email or physical address to which to send the required notice.

      (c) Unless the participant was granted an exception under this subpart to the spousal consent requirement within 90 days of the date the withdrawal request is processed by the TSP record keeper, before obtaining an in-service withdrawal, a participant who is covered by FERS or who is a member of the uniformed services must obtain the consent of his or her spouse and waiver of the spouse's right to a joint and survivor annuity described in § 1650.61(c) with respect to the applicable amount. To show the spouse's consent and waiver, a participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a properly completed withdrawal request, signed by his or her spouse. Once a request containing the spouse's consent and waiver has been submitted to the TSP record keeper, the spouse's consent is irrevocable for that withdrawal.

      § 1650.63   Executive Director's exception to the spousal notification requirement.

      (a) Whenever this subpart requires the Executive Director to give notice of an action to the spouse of a CSRS participant, an exception to this requirement may be granted if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for such an exception must be submitted to the TSP record keeper in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper, accompanied by the following:

      (1) A court order stating that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined;

      (2) A police or governmental agency determination, signed by the appropriate department or division head, which states that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or

      (3) Statements by the participant and two other persons, which meet the following requirements:

      (i) The participant's statement must give the full name of the spouse, declare the participant's inability to locate the spouse, state the last time the spouse's location was known, explain why the spouse's location is not known currently, and describe the good faith efforts the participant has made to locate the spouse in the 90 days before the request for an exception was received by the TSP record keeper. Examples of attempting to locate the spouse include, but are not limited to, checking with relatives and mutual friends or using telephone directories and directory assistance for the city of the spouse's last known address. Negative statements, such as, “I have not seen nor heard from him,” or “I have not had contact with her,” are not sufficient.

      (ii) The statements from two other persons must support the participant's statement that he or she does not know the spouse's whereabouts, and substantiate the participant's description of the efforts he or she made to locate the spouse, including the dates the participant made those efforts.

      (iii) All statements must be signed and dated and must include the following certification: “I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable under Federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.”.

      (b) A TSP withdrawal election will be processed within 90 days of an approved exception so long as the spouse named on the TSP withdrawal request is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.

      (c) The TSP and/or its record keeper may require a participant to provide additional information before granting a waiver. The TSP and/or its record keeper may use any of the information provided to conduct its own search for the spouse.

      § 1650.64   Executive Director's exception to the spousal consent requirement.

#### § § 1650.64

      (a) Whenever this subpart requires the consent of a spouse of a FERS or uniformed services participant to a loan or TSP withdrawal or a waiver of the right to a survivor annuity, an exception to this requirement may be granted if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that:

      (1) The spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; or

      (2) Due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the spouse's signature would be inappropriate.

      (i) An exception to the requirement for a spouse's signature may be granted based on exceptional circumstances only when the participant presents a court order or government agency determination that contains a finding or a recitation of exceptional circumstances regarding the spouse which would warrant an exception to the signature requirement.

      (ii) Exceptional circumstances are narrowly construed, but are exemplified by a court order or government agency determination that:

      (A) Indicates that the spouse and the participant have been maintaining separate residences with no financial relationship for three or more years;

      (B) Indicates that the spouse abandoned the participant, but for religious or similarly compelling reasons, the parties chose not to divorce; or

      (C) Expressly states that the participant may obtain a loan from his or her TSP account or make a TSP withdrawal notwithstanding the absence of the spouse's signature.

      (b) A post-employment distribution election or an in-service withdrawal request processed within 90 days of an approved exception will be accepted by the TSP record keeper so long as the spouse named on the request is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.

    (b)  If the TSP record keeper processes a notice that a participant has died, it will cancel any pending request by the participant to withdraw his or her account. The TSP record keeper will also cancel an annuity purchase made on or after the participant's date of death but before annuity payments have begun, and the annuity vendor will return the funds to the TSP. The funds designated by the participant for the withdrawal will be paid as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, unless the participant elected to withdrawal his or her account in the form of an annuity, in which case the funds designated for the purchase of the annuity will be paid as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section:

    (1) If the participant requested a single life annuity with no cash refund or 10-year certain feature, the TSP record keeper will pay the funds as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

    (2) If the participant requested a single life annuity with a cash refund or 10-year certain feature, the TSP record keeper will pay the funds as a death benefit to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the participant on the annuity portion of the TSP post-employment distribution request, or as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section if no beneficiary designated on the withdrawal request survives the participant.

    (3) If the participant requested a joint life annuity without additional features, the TSP record keeper will pay the funds as a death benefit to the joint life annuitant if he or she survives the participant, or as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section if the joint life annuitant does not survive the participant.

    (4) If the participant requested a joint life annuity with a cash refund or 10-year certain feature, the TSP record keeper will pay the funds as a death benefit to the joint life annuitant if he or she survives the participant, or as a death benefit to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the participant on the annuity portion of the TSP post-employment distribution request if the joint life annuitant does not survive the participant, or as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section if neither the joint life annuitant nor any designated beneficiary survives the participant.

    (5) If a participant dies after annuity payments have begun, the annuity vendor will make or stop the payments in accordance with the annuity method selected.

    (c)  If the TSP record keeper processes a notice that a participant has died, any pending loan disbursement will be cancelled and the funds designated for the loan will be distributed as a death benefit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If a TSP loan has been disbursed, but the check has not been negotiated (or an electronic funds transfer (EFT) has been returned), the loan proceeds will be used to pay off the loan. If the loan check has been negotiated (or the EFT has been processed), the funds cannot be returned to the TSP and the TSP record keeper will declare the loan balance as a loan foreclosure in accordance with part 1655 of this chapter.

    (d)  Upon a participant's death, his or her TSP account will remain invested in the same TSP core funds as the account balance was invested on his or her date of death. If any portion of the participant's TSP account is invested through the mutual fund window at the time of his or her death, his or her mutual fund window account will be closed and the balance will be transferred back to the TSP core funds in the participant's TSP account in accordance with his or her most recent investment election until it is paid out or a beneficiary participant account is established under this part.

    § 1651.3   Designation of beneficiary.

#### § § 1651.3

    (a)  A participant may designate one or more beneficiaries for his or her TSP account. A valid TSP designation of beneficiary remains in effect until it is properly changed as described in § 1651.4.

A participant can name up to 20 total (primary and contingent) beneficiaries to share the death benefit. A beneficiary may be designated without the knowledge or consent of that beneficiary or the knowledge or consent of the participant's spouse.

    (c)  To be valid and accepted by the TSP record keeper, a TSP designation of beneficiary must:

    (1) Be received by the TSP record keeper on or before the date of the participant's death;

    (2) Identify the participant in such a manner so that the TSP record keeper can locate his or her TSP account;

    (3) Be signed and properly dated by the participant and signed and properly dated by one witness:

    (i) The participant must either sign the designation of beneficiary in the presence of the witness or acknowledge his or her signature on the designation of beneficiary to the witness;

    (ii) A witness must be age 21 or older; and

    (iii) A witness designated as a beneficiary will not be entitled to receive a death benefit payment; if a witness is the only named beneficiary, the designation of the beneficiary is invalid. If more than one beneficiary is named, the share of the witness beneficiary will be allocated among the remaining beneficiaries pro rata;

    (4) Designate primary beneficiary shares which when summed equal 100%;

    (5) Contain no substantive alterations (e.g., struck-through shares or scratched-out names of beneficiaries);

    (6) Designate each primary and each contingent beneficiary in such a manner so that the TSP record keeper can identify the individual or entity;

    (7) Not attempt to designate beneficiaries for the participant's traditional balance and the participant's Roth balance separately; and

    (8) Be received by the TSP record keeper not more than 365 calendar days after the date of the participant's most recent signature.

    (d)  A participant cannot use a will to designate a TSP beneficiary.

    § 1651.4   How to change a designation of beneficiary.

#### § § 1651.4

    (a)  To change a designation of beneficiary, the participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a new TSP designation of beneficiary meeting the requirements of § 1651.3 to the TSP record keeper. If the TSP record keeper receives more than one valid designation of beneficiary, it will honor the designation with the latest date signed by the participant. A participant may change a TSP beneficiary at any time, without the knowledge or consent of any person, including his or her spouse.

    (b) [Reserved]

    (c)  A participant cannot use a will to change a TSP designation of beneficiary.

#### § § 1651.5

    (a) For purposes of payment under § 1651.2(a)(2) and establishment of beneficiary participant accounts under § 1651.19, the spouse of the participant is the person to whom the participant was married on the date of death. A person is considered to be married even if the parties are separated, unless a court decree of divorce or annulment has been entered. The laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was initially established will be used to determine whether the participant was married on the date of death.

    (b) If a person claims to have a marriage at common law with a deceased participant, the TSP record keeper will pay benefits to the putative spouse under § 1651.2(a)(2) in accordance with the marital status shown on the most recent Federal income tax return filed by the participant. Alternatively, the putative spouse may submit a court order or administrative adjudication determining that the common law marriage is valid.

    (a)  A child includes a natural or adopted child of the deceased participant.

    (b)  “By representation” means that, if a child of the participant dies before the participant, all descendants of the deceased child at the same level will equally divide the deceased child's share of the participant's account.

    (c)  A natural child of a TSP participant who has been adopted by someone other than the participant during the participant's lifetime will not be considered the child of the participant, unless the adopting parent is the spouse of the TSP participant.

    (d)  If the identity of the father or mother of a child is in dispute or otherwise unclear (e.g., only one parent is listed on a birth certificate), the purported child must submit to the TSP record keeper either:

    (1) A court order or other administrative finding establishing parentage; or

    (2) Documentation sufficient for establishing parentage under the law of the state in which the participant was domiciled at the time of death.

    If the account is to be paid to the participant's parent or parents under § 1651.2(a)(4), the following rules apply:

    (a)  If both parents are alive at the time of the participant's death, each parent will be separately paid fifty percent of the account. If only one parent is alive at the time of the participant's death, he or she will receive the entire account balance.

    (b)  A step-parent is not considered a parent unless the step-parent adopted the participant.

    § 1651.8   Participant's estate.

#### § § 1651.8

    If the account is to be paid to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the participant's estate under § 1651.2(a)(5), the following rules apply:

    (a)  The executor or administrator must provide documentation of court appointment.

    (b)  If state law provides procedures for handling small estates, the TSP record keeper will accept the person authorized to dispose of the assets of the deceased participant under those procedures as a duly appointed executor or administrator. Documentation which demonstrates that the person is properly authorized under state law must be submitted to the TSP record keeper.

    If the account is to be paid to the participant's next of kin under § 1651.2(a)(6), the next of kin of the participant will be determined in accordance with the state law of the participant's domicile at the time of death.

    § 1651.10   Deceased and non-existent beneficiaries.

#### § § 1651.10

    (a)  The share of any designated beneficiary who predeceases the participant will be paid pro rata to the participant's other designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. If no designated beneficiary survives the participant, the account will be paid according to the order of precedence set forth in § 1651.2(a).

    (b)  If a participant designated a trust or other entity as a beneficiary and the entity does not exist on the date of the participant's death, or is not created by will or other document that is effective upon the participant's death, the amount designated to the entity will be paid in accordance with the rules of paragraph (a) of this section, as if the trust were a beneficiary that predeceased the participant.

    (c)  If a beneficiary other than a beneficiary designated on a TSP designation of beneficiary dies before the participant, the beneficiary's share will be paid equally to other living beneficiaries bearing the same relationship to the participant as the deceased beneficiary. However, if the deceased beneficiary is a child of the participant, payment will be made to the deceased child's descendants, if any. If there are no other beneficiaries bearing the same relationship or, in the case of children, there are no descendants of deceased children, the deceased beneficiary's share will be paid to the person(s) next in line according to the order of precedence.

    (d)  If a beneficiary dies after the participant, the beneficiary's share will be paid to the beneficiary's estate. A copy of a beneficiary's certified death certificate is required in order to establish that the beneficiary has died, and when.

    § 1651.11   Simultaneous death.

#### § § 1651.11

    If a beneficiary dies at the same time as the participant, the beneficiary will be treated as if he or she predeceased the participant and the account will be paid in accordance with § 1651.10. The same time is considered to be the same hour and minute as indicated on a death certificate. If the participant and beneficiary are killed in the same event, death is presumed to be simultaneous, unless evidence is presented to the contrary.

    § 1651.12   Homicide.

#### § § 1651.12

    If the participant's death is the result of a homicide, a beneficiary will not be paid as long as the beneficiary is under investigation by local, state or Federal law enforcement authorities as a suspect. If the beneficiary is implicated in the death of the participant and the beneficiary would be precluded from inheriting under state law, the beneficiary will not be entitled to receive any portion of the participant's account. The TSP record keeper will follow the state law of the participant's domicile as that law is set forth in a civil court judgment (that, under the law of the state, would protect the TSP record keeper from double liability or payment) or, in the absence of such a judgment, will apply state law to the facts after all criminal appeals are exhausted. The TSP record keeper will treat the beneficiary as if he or she predeceased the participant and the account will be paid in accordance with § 1651.10.

> [87 FR 31686, May 24, 2022]

    § 1651.14   How payment is made.

#### § § 1651.14

    (a)  Each beneficiary's death benefit will be disbursed pro rata from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The payment from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The payment from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, all death benefits will be disbursed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the deceased participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each TSP core fund or source of contributions on the day the disbursement is made. Disbursement will be made separately for each entitled beneficiary.

    (b)  The TSP record keeper will automatically transfer a surviving spouse's death benefit to a beneficiary participant account (described in § 1651.19) established in the spouse's name. The TSP record keeper will not maintain a beneficiary participant account if the balance of the beneficiary participant account is less than $200 on the date the account is established. The TSP record keeper also will not transfer this amount or pay it by electronic funds transfer. Instead, the spouse will receive an immediate distribution in the form of a check.

    (c)  The TSP record keeper will send notice of pending payment to each beneficiary. Payment will be sent to the address that is provided on the participant's TSP designation of beneficiary unless the TSP record keeper receives notice of a more recent address. All individual beneficiaries must provide the TSP record keeper with a Social Security number. The following additional rules apply to payments to nonspouse beneficiaries:

    (1)  Payment will be made in the name of a minor child or incompetent beneficiary. A parent or other guardian may direct where the payment should be sent and may make any permitted tax withholding election. A guardian of a minor child or incompetent beneficiary must submit court documentation showing his or her appointment as guardian.

    (2)  If payment is to the executor or administrator of an estate, the check will be made payable to the estate of the deceased participant, not to the executor or administrator. A taxpayer identification number must be provided for all estates.

    (3)  If payment is to a trust, the payment will be made payable to the trust and mailed in care of the trustee. A taxpayer identification number must be provided for the trust.

    (4)  If payment is to an inherited IRA on behalf of a nonspouse beneficiary, the check will be made payable to the account. Information pertaining to the inherited IRA must be submitted by the IRA trustee. A payment to an inherited IRA will be made only in accordance with the rules set forth in 5 CFR 1650.25.

    (5)  If a death benefit payment is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to contact the beneficiary. If the beneficiary does not respond within 90 days, the death benefit payment will be forfeited to the TSP. The beneficiary can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with investment returns.

    (6)  A properly paid death benefit payment cannot be returned to the TSP.

    § 1651.15   Claims referred to the Board.

#### § § 1651.15

    (a)  Any challenge to a proposed death benefit payment must be filed in writing with the TSP record keeper before payment. All contested claims will be referred to the Board. The Board may also consider issues on its own.

    (b)  No payment will be made until the Board has resolved the claim.

    § 1651.16   Missing and unknown beneficiaries.

#### § § 1651.16

    (a)  (1) The TSP record keeper will attempt to identify and locate all potential beneficiaries.

    (2) If a beneficiary is not identified and located, and at least one year has passed since the date of the participant's death, the beneficiary will be treated as having predeceased the participant and the beneficiary's share will be paid in accordance with § 1651.10

    (b)  If all potential beneficiaries are known but one or more beneficiaries (and not all) appear to be missing, payment of part of the participant's account may be made to the known beneficiaries. The lost or unidentified beneficiary's share may be paid in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section at a later date.

    (c)  If no beneficiaries of the account are located, the account will be considered abandoned and the funds will revert to the TSP. If there are multiple beneficiaries and one or more of them refuses to cooperate in the TSP record keeper's search for the missing beneficiary, the missing beneficiary's share will be considered abandoned. In such circumstances, the account can be reclaimed if the missing beneficiary is found at a later date. However, earnings will not be credited from the date the account is abandoned. The TSP may require the beneficiary to apply for the death benefit in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper and submit proof of identity and relationship to the participant.

    § 1651.17   Disclaimer of benefits.

#### § § 1651.17

    (a)  The beneficiary of a TSP account may disclaim his or her right to receive all or part of a TSP death benefit. If the disclaimant is a minor, the parent or guardian of the minor must sign the disclaimer.

    (b)  The disclaimer must expressly state that the beneficiary is disclaiming his or her right to receive either all or a stated percentage of the death benefit payable from the TSP account of the named participant and must be:

    (1) Submitted in writing;

    (2) Signed or acknowledged, in the presence of a notary, by the person (or legal representative) disclaiming the benefit; and

    (3) Received before the TSP pays the death benefit.

    (c)  A disclaimer is invalid if it:

    (1) Is revocable;

    (2) Directs to whom the disclaimed benefit should be paid; or

    (3) Specifies which balance (traditional, Roth, or tax-exempt) is to be disclaimed.

    (d)  The disclaimed share will be paid as though the beneficiary predeceased the participant, according to the rules set forth in § 1651.10. Any part of the death benefit which is not disclaimed will be paid to the disclaimant pursuant to § 1651.14.

    § 1651.19   Beneficiary participant accounts.

#### § § 1651.19

    (a)  Each beneficiary participant account, once established, will be allocated to the TSP core funds in which the deceased participant's account balance was invested on his or her date of death. A beneficiary participant may redistribute his or her beneficiary participant account balance among the TSP core funds by making a fund reallocation or fund transfer request described in part 1601, subpart C, of this chapter. A beneficiary participant may move a portion of his or her beneficiary account balance from the TSP core funds to the mutual fund window by making a fund transfer request described in part 1601, subpart F.

    (b)  A beneficiary participant may not make contributions or rollovers to his or her beneficiary participant account. The TSP record keeper will not accept an investment election request described in part 1601, subpart B, of this chapter for a beneficiary participant account.

    (c)  (1) A beneficiary participant must receive required minimum distributions from his or her beneficiary participant account commencing no later than the required beginning date and, for each year thereafter, no later than December 31.

    (2) A beneficiary participant may elect to withdraw from his or her account or to begin receiving payments before the required beginning date, but is not required to do so.

    (3) In the event that a beneficiary participant does not withdraw from his or her beneficiary participant account an amount sufficient to satisfy his or her required minimum distribution for the year, the TSP record keeper will automatically distribute the necessary amount on or before the applicable date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    (4) The TSP record keeper will disburse required minimum distributions described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section pro rata from the beneficiary participant's traditional balance and the beneficiary participant's Roth balance.

    (d)  A beneficiary participant may elect any withdrawal option is available to separated participants. The provisions of § 1650.12, § 1650.13, and § 1650.14 shall apply as if all references to a participant are references to a beneficiary participant and all references to an account balance are references to a beneficiary participant account balance.

    (e)  A beneficiary participant is ineligible to request the following types of withdrawals from his or her beneficiary participant account: Age-based withdrawals described in § 1650.31 of this chapter, financial hardship withdrawals described in § 1650.32 of this chapter, or loans described in part 1655 of this chapter.

    (f)  The spousal rights described in 5 U.S.C. 8351, 5 U.S.C. 8435, and § 1650.61 of this chapter do not apply to beneficiary participant accounts.

    (g)  A beneficiary participant may request that the TSP record keeper roll over all or a portion of an eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of I.R.C. section 402(c)) from his or her beneficiary participant account to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA or eligible employer plan (including a civilian or uniformed services TSP account other than a beneficiary participant account) in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.

    (h)  The TSP or its record keeper will furnish beneficiary participants with periodic statements in a manner consistent with part 1640 of this chapter.

    (i)  Part 1630 of this chapter shall apply with respect to a beneficiary participant as if the beneficiary participant is a TSP participant.

    (j)  If, because of an error committed by the Board or the TSP record keeper, a beneficiary participant's account is not credited or charged with the investment gains or losses the account would have received had the error not occurred, the account will be credited subject to and in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in § 1605.21. A beneficiary participant may submit a claim for correction of Board or TSP record keeper error pursuant to the procedures described in § 1605.22.

    (k)  Court orders relating to a civilian beneficiary participant account or uniformed services beneficiary participant account shall be processed pursuant to the procedures set forth in part 1653 of this chapter as if all references to a TSP participant are references to a beneficiary participant and all references to a TSP account or account balance are references to a beneficiary participant account or beneficiary participant account balance. Notwithstanding any provision of part 1653, a payee of a court-ordered distribution from a beneficiary participant account cannot request a rollover of the court-ordered distribution to an

    (l)  To the extent it is not inconsistent with this § 1651.19, a beneficiary participant account shall be disbursed upon the death of the beneficiary participant in accordance with part 1651 as if any reference to a participant is a reference to a beneficiary participant. For example, a beneficiary participant may designate a beneficiary for his or her beneficiary participant account in accordance with §§ 1651.3 and 1651.4. No individual who is entitled to a death benefit from a beneficiary participant account shall be eligible to keep the death benefit in the TSP or request that the TSP record keeper roll over all or a portion of the death benefit to an IRA or eligible employer plan.

    (m)  Uniformed services beneficiary participant accounts are subject to the following additional rules and procedures:

    (1) Uniformed services beneficiary participant accounts are established and maintained separately from civilian beneficiary participant accounts. Beneficiary participants who have a uniformed services beneficiary participant account and a civilian beneficiary participant account will be issued two separate TSP account numbers. A beneficiary participant must submit separate fund allocation, fund transfer, re and/or TSP withdrawal requests for each account and submit separate beneficiary designations for each account;

    (2) A uniformed services beneficiary participant account and a civilian beneficiary participant account cannot be combined;

    (3) If a uniformed services beneficiary participant account contains tax-exempt contributions, any payments or withdrawals from the account will be distributed pro rata from the tax-deferred balance and the tax-exempt balance;

    (4) A beneficiary participant may roll over all or any portion of an eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of I.R.C. section 402(c)) from a uniformed services beneficiary participant account into a civilian or uniformed services TSP participant account. However, tax-exempt money attributable to combat zone contributions cannot be rolled over from a uniformed services beneficiary participant account to a civilian TSP participant account.

    (n)  Each beneficiary participant account is maintained separately from all other beneficiary participant accounts. If an individual has multiple beneficiary participant accounts, each of the individual's beneficiary participant accounts will have a unique account number. A beneficiary participant must submit separate fund reallocation, fund transfer, and/or TSP withdrawal requests and submit separate beneficiary designations for each beneficiary participant account that the TSP maintains for him or her. A beneficiary participant account cannot be combined with another beneficiary participant account.

      (i) The order must expressly refer to the “Thrift Savings Plan” or describe the TSP in such a way that it cannot be confused with other Federal Government retirement benefits or non-Federal retirement benefits;

      (ii) The order must be written in terms appropriate to a defined contribution plan rather than a defined benefit plan. For example, it should generally refer to the participant's TSP account or TSP account balance rather than a benefit formula or the participant's eventual benefits; and

      (iii) If the participant has a civilian TSP account and a uniformed services TSP account, the order must expressly identify the account to which it relates.

      (2) The order must either require the TSP to freeze the participant's account to preserve the  pending final resolution of the parties' rights to the participant's TSP account, or to make a payment from the participant's account to a permissible payee.

      (3) If the order requires a payment from the participant's account, the award must be for:

      (i) A specific dollar amount;

      (ii) A stated percentage of the account; or

      (iii) A survivor annuity as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d).

      (iv) The following examples would qualify to require payment from the TSP, although ambiguous or conflicting language used elsewhere could cause the order to be rejected.

      (A)  ORDERED: [payee's name, Social Security number (SSN), and address] is awarded $____ from the [civilian or uniformed services] Thrift Savings Plan account of [participant's name, account number or SSN, and address].

      (B)  ORDERED: [payee's name, SSN, and address] is awarded ____ % of the [civilian and/or uniformed services] Thrift Savings Plan account[s] of [participant's name, account number or SSN, and address] as of [date].

      (4) A court order can require a payment only to a spouse, former spouse, child or dependent of a participant.

      (b) The following retirement benefits court orders are not qualifying and thus are not enforceable against the TSP:

      (1) An order relating to a TSP account that has been closed;

      (2) An order relating to a TSP account that contains only nonvested money;

      (3) An order requiring the return to the TSP of money that was properly paid pursuant to an earlier court order;

      (4) An order requiring the TSP to make a payment in the future, unless the present value of the payee's entitlement can be calculated, in which case the TSP will make the payment currently;

      (5) An order that does not specify the account to which the order applies, if the participant has both a civilian TSP account and a uniformed services TSP account;

      (6) An order that requires the TSP to calculate the payee's entitlement or earnings in a manner that is inconsistent with § 1653.4 of this part; and

      (7) An order that designates the TSP core fund, source of contributions, or balance (e.g., traditional, Roth, or tax-exempt) from which the payment or portions of the payment shall be made.

      § 1653.3   Processing retirement benefits court orders.

#### § § 1653.3

      (a) The payment of a retirement benefits court order from the TSP is governed solely by FERSA and by the terms of this subpart. The TSP record keeper will honor retirement benefits court orders properly issued and certified by a court (as defined in § 1653.1). However, those courts have no jurisdiction over the TSP and the TSP cannot be made a party to the underlying domestic relations proceedings.

      (b) The TSP record keeper will review a retirement benefits court order to determine whether it is enforceable against the TSP only after the TSP record keeper has received a complete copy of the document. Receipt by an employing agency or any other agency of the Government does not constitute receipt by the TSP record keeper. Retirement benefits court orders should be submitted to the TSP record keeper at the current address as provided at  Receipt by the TSP record keeper is considered receipt by the TSP. To be complete, a court order must be written in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation and contain all pages and attachments; it must also provide (or be accompanied by a document that provides):

      (1) The participant's account number or Social Security number (SSN);

      (2) The name and last known mailing address of each payee covered by the order; and

      (3) The payee's SSN and state of legal residence if he or she is the current or former spouse of the participant.

      (c) As soon as practicable after the TSP record keeper receives a document that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order, whether or not complete, the participant's account will be frozen. After the account is frozen, no withdrawals or loan disbursements (other than a required minimum distribution pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9)) will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. All other account activity will be permitted.

      (d) The following documents do not purport to be qualifying retirement benefits court orders, and accounts of participants to whom such orders relate will not be frozen:

      (1) A court order relating to a TSP account that has been closed;

      (2) A court order dated before June 6, 1986;

      (3) A court order that does not award all or any part of the TSP account to someone other than the participant; and

      (4) A court order that does not mention retirement benefits.

      (e) After the participant's account is frozen, the TSP record keeper will review the document further to determine if it is complete; if the document is not complete, it will be rejected, the account will be unfrozen, all parties will be notified, and no further action will be taken with respect to the document.

      (f) The TSP record keeper will review a complete copy of an order to determine whether it is a qualifying retirement benefits court order as described in § 1653.2. The TSP record keeper will mail a decision letter to all parties containing the following information:

      (1) A determination regarding whether the court order is qualifying;

      (2) A statement of the applicable statutes and regulations;

      (3) An explanation of the effect the court order has on the participant's TSP account; and

      (4) If the qualifying order requires payment, the letter will provide:

      (i) An explanation of how the payment will be calculated and an estimated amount of payment;

      (ii) The anticipated date of payment;

      (iii) Tax and withholding information to the person responsible for paying Federal income tax on the payment;

      (iv) Information on how to roll over the payment to an eligible employer plan within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 402(c)), traditional IRA, or Roth IRA (if the payee is the current or former spouse of the participant); and

      (v) Information on how to receive the payment through an electronic funds transfer (EFT).

      (g)[Reserved]

      (h) An account frozen under this section will be unfrozen as follows:

      (1) If the account was frozen in response to an order issued to preserve the status quo pending final resolution of the parties' rights to the participant's TSP account, the account will be unfrozen if the TSP record keeper receives a court order that vacates or supersedes the previous order (unless the order vacating or superseding the order itself qualifies to place a freeze on the account). A court order that purports to require a payment from the TSP supersedes an order issued to preserve the status quo, even if it does not qualify to require a payment from the TSP;

      (2) If the account was frozen in response to an order purporting to require a payment from the TSP, the freeze will be lifted:

      (i) Once payment is made, if the court order is qualifying; or

      (ii) Eighteen (18) months after the date of the decision letter if the court order is not qualifying. The 18-month period will be terminated, and the account will be unfrozen, if both parties submit to the TSP record keeper a written request for such a termination.

      (i) The TSP record keeper will hold in abeyance the processing of a court-ordered payment if the TSP record keeper is notified in writing that the underlying court order has been appealed, and that the effect of the filing of the appeal is to stay the enforceability of the order.

      (1) In the notification, the TSP record keeper must be provided with proper documentation of the appeal and citations to legal authority, which address the effect of the appeal on the enforceability of the underlying court order.

      (i) If the TSP record keeper receives proper documentation and citations to legal authority which demonstrate that the underlying court order is not enforceable, the TSP record keeper will inform the parties that the payment will not occur until resolution of the appeal, and the account will remain frozen for loans and withdrawals.

      (ii) In the absence of proper documentation and citations to legal authority, the TSP record keeper will presume that the provisions relating to the TSP in the court order remain valid and will proceed with the payment process.

      (2) The TSP record keeper must be notified in writing of the disposition of the appeal before the freeze will be removed from the participant's account or a payment will be made. The notification must include a complete copy of an order from the appellate court explaining the effect of the appeal on the participant's account.

      (j) Multiple qualifying court orders relating to the same TSP account and received by the TSP record keeper will be processed as follows:

      (1) If the orders make awards to the same payee or payees and do not indicate that the awards are cumulative, the TSP record keeper will only honor the order bearing the latest effective date.

      (2) If the orders relate to different former spouses of the participant and award survivor annuities, the TSP record keeper will honor them in the order of their effective dates.

      (3) If the orders relate to different payees and award fixed dollar amounts, percentages of an account, or portions of an account calculated by the application of formulae, the orders will be honored:

      (i) In the order of their receipt by the TSP record keeper, if received by the TSP record keeper on different days; or

      (ii) In the order of their effective dates, if received by the TSP record keeper on the same day.

      (4) In all other cases, the TSP record keeper will honor multiple qualifying court orders relating to the same TSP account in the order of their receipt by the TSP record keeper.

      § 1653.4   Calculating entitlements.

#### § § 1653.4

      (a) For purposes of computing the amount of a payee's entitlement under this section, a participant's TSP account balance will include any loan balance outstanding as of the date used for calculating the payee's entitlement, unless the court order provides otherwise.

      (b) If the court order awards a percentage of an account as of a specific date, the payee's entitlement will be calculated based on the account balance as of that date. If the date specified in the order is not a business day, the TSP record keeper will use the participant's account balance as of the last preceding business day.

      (c) If the court order awards a percentage of an account but does not contain a specific date as of which to apply that percentage, the TSP record keeper will use the liquidation date.

      (d) If the court order awards a specific dollar amount, the payee's entitlement will be the lesser of:

      (1) The dollar amount stated in the court order; or

      (2) The vested account balance on the date of disbursement.

      (e) If a court order describes a payee's entitlement in terms of a fixed dollar amount and a percentage or fraction of the account, the TSP will pay the fixed dollar amount, even if the percentage or fraction, when applied to the account balance, would yield a different result.

      (f) The payee's entitlement will be credited with TSP investment earnings as described:

      (1) The entitlement calculated under this section will not be credited with TSP investment earnings unless the court order specifically provides otherwise. The court order may not specify a rate for earnings.

      (2) If earnings are awarded and a rate is specified, the rate must be expressed as an annual percentage rate or as a  dollar amount added to the payee's entitlement.

      (3) If earnings are awarded, the TSP record keeper will calculate the amount to be awarded by:

      (i) Determining the payee's award amount (e.g., the percentage of the participant's account);

      (ii) Determining, based on the participant's investment allocation as of the date used to calculate the entitlement, the number and composition of shares that the payee's award amount would have purchased as of the date used to calculate the entitlement.

      (iii) Multiplying the price per share as of the payment date by the number and composition of shares calculated in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.

      (g) The TSP record keeper will estimate the amount of a payee's entitlement when it prepares the decision letter and will recalculate the entitlement at the time of payment. The recalculation may differ from the initial estimation because:

      (1) The estimation of the payee's entitlement includes both vested and nonvested amounts in the participant's account. If, at the time of payment, the nonvested portion of the account has not become vested, the recalculated entitlement will apply only to the participant's vested account balance;

      (2) After the estimate of the payee's entitlement is prepared, the TSP record keeper may process account transactions that have an effective date on or before the date used to compute the payee's entitlement. Those transactions will be included when the payee's entitlement is recalculated at the time of payment; and

      (3) The amount available for payment from the account may be reduced due to changes in share price ( investment losses).

      § 1653.5   Payment.

#### § § 1653.5

      (a)  Payment pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order will generally be made:

      (1) As soon as administratively practicable after the date of the decision letter when the payee is the current or former spouse of the participant, but in no event earlier than 30 days after the date of the decision letter.

      (2) As soon as administratively practicable after the date of the decision letter when the payee is someone other than the current or former spouse of the participant.

      (b) In no case will payment exceed the participant's vested account balance, minus any outstanding loan balance.

      (c) The entire amount of a court order payee's entitlement must be disbursed at one time. A series of payments will not be made, even if the court order provides for such a method of payment. A payment pursuant to a court order extinguishes all rights to any further payment under that order, even if the entire amount of the entitlement cannot be paid. Any further award must be contained in a separate court order.

      (d) Payment will be made pro rata from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The distribution from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The payment from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, all payments will be distributed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each fund or source of contributions on the day the disbursement is made. The TSP record keeper will not honor provisions of a court order that require payment to be made from a specific TSP core fund, source of contributions, or balance.

      (e) Payment will be made only to the person or persons specified in the court order. However, if the court order specifies a third-party mailing address for the payment, the TSP record keeper will mail to the address specified any portion of the payment that is not rolled over to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or eligible employer plan within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 402(c)).

      (f) Payment will not be made jointly to two or more persons. If the court order requires payments to more than one person, the order must separately indicate the amount to be paid to each.

      (g) If there are insufficient funds to pay each court order payee, payment will be made as follows:

      (1) If the order specifies an order of precedence for the payments, the TSP record keeper will honor it.

      (2) If the order does not specify an order of precedence for the payments, the TSP record keeper will pay a current or former spouse first and a dependent second.

      (h) If the payee dies before a payment is disbursed, payment will be made to the estate of the payee, unless otherwise specified by the court order. A distribution to the estate of a deceased court order payee will be reported as income to the decedent's estate. If the participant dies before payment is made, the order will be honored so long as it is submitted to the TSP record keeper before the TSP account has been closed.

      (i) If the parties to a divorce or annulment have remarried each other, or a legal separation is terminated, a new court order will be required to prevent payment pursuant to a previously submitted qualifying retirement benefits court order.

      (j) Payment to a person (including the estate of the payee) pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order made in accordance with this subpart bars recovery by any other person claiming entitlement to the payment.

      (k) If a court ordered payment is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the payee by writing to the address provided on the court order. If the payee does not respond within 90 days, the funds will be forfeited to the TSP. The payee can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.

      (m) A payee who is a current or former spouse of the participant may elect to roll over a court-ordered payment to a traditional IRA, eligible employer plan within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 402(c)), or Roth IRA. Any election permitted by this paragraph (m) must be made pursuant to the rules described in 5 CFR 1650.25.

      (n) If a court order payee who is the current or former spouse of the participant has their own TSP account (other than a beneficiary participant account), the payee can request that the TSP record keeper roll over the court-ordered payment to the payee's TSP account in accordance with the rules described in 5 CFR 1650.25. However, any pro rata share attributable to tax-exempt contributions cannot be rolled over; instead, it will be paid directly to the payee.

      § 1653.6   Fees.

#### § § 1653.6

      The TSP record keeper will charge a participant a $600.00 court order processing fee as follows:

      (a) Upon receipt of a complete court order document (whether draft or final) and prior to reviewing the order to determine whether it is a qualifying retirement benefits court order, the fee will be deducted from his or her TSP account balance on a pro rata basis from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The portion of the fee deducted from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The portion of the fee deducted from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, the entire fee will be distributed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each fund or source of contributions on the day the fee is deducted;

      (b) The fee will be charged only once per court order. However, it will not be refunded in the event that the court order is never determined to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order; and

      (c)(1) If the court order:

      (i) Is determined to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order; and

      (ii) Explicitly requires the fee to be split between the participant and the payee;

      (2) The TSP record keeper will deduct the payee's portion of the fee from his or her payment and credit that amount back to the participant's TSP account balance.

      § 1653.12   Qualifying legal processes.

#### § § 1653.12

      (a) The TSP record keeper will only honor the terms of a legal process that is qualifying under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) A legal process must meet each of the following requirements to be considered qualifying:

      § 1653.13   Processing legal processes.

#### § § 1653.13

      (a) The payment of legal processes from the TSP is governed solely by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, and by the terms of this subpart. Although the TSP record keeper will honor legal processes properly issued by a competent authority, those entities have no jurisdiction over the TSP and the TSP cannot be made a party to the underlying proceedings.

      (b) The TSP record keeper will review a legal process to determine whether it is enforceable against the TSP only after the TSP record keeper has received a complete copy of the document. Receipt by an employing agency or any other agency of the Government does not constitute receipt by the TSP. Legal processes should be submitted to the TSP record keeper at the current address as provided at  Receipt by the TSP record keeper is considered receipt by the TSP. To be complete, a legal process must contain all pages and attachments; it must also provide (or be accompanied by a document that provides):

      (1) The participant's account number or Social Security number (SSN);

      (2) The name and last known mailing address of each payee covered under the order; and

      (3) The SSN and state of legal residence of the payee if he or she if the current or former spouse of the participant.

      (c) As soon as practicable after the TSP record keeper receives a document that purports to be a qualifying legal process, whether or not complete, the participant's account will be frozen. After the account is frozen, no TSP withdrawal or loan disbursements will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. All other account activity will be permitted, including contributions, loan repayments, adjustments, investment elections, fund reallocations, and fund transfers.

      (d) The following documents will not be treated as purporting to be a qualifying legal processes, and accounts of participants to whom such orders relate will not be frozen:

      (1) A document that does not indicate on its face (or accompany a document that establishes) that it has been issued by a competent authority;

      (2) A legal process relating to a TSP account that has been closed; and

      (3) A legal process that does not relate either to the TSP or to the participant's retirement benefits.

      (e) After the participant's account is frozen, the TSP record keeper will review the document further to determine if it is complete; if the document is not complete, it will be rejected, the account will be unfrozen, all parties will be notified, and no further action will be taken with respect to the document.

      (f) As soon as practicable after receipt of a complete copy of a legal process, the TSP record keeper will review it to determine whether it is a qualifying legal process as described in § 1653.12. The TSP record keeper will mail a decision letter to all parties containing the same information described at § 1653.3(f).

      (g) [Reserved]

      (h) An account frozen under this section will be unfrozen as follows:

      (1) If the account was frozen pursuant to a legal process requiring the TSP to freeze the participant's account in anticipation of an order to pay from the account, the account will be unfrozen if any one of the following events occurs:

      (i) As soon as practicable after the TSP record keeper receives a complete copy of an order vacating or superseding the preliminary order (unless the order vacating or superseding the preliminary order qualifies to place a freeze on the account);

      (ii) Upon payment pursuant to the order to pay from the account, if the TSP record keeper determines that the order is qualifying; or

      (iii) As soon as practicable after the TSP issues a decision letter informing the parties that the order to pay from the account is not a qualifying legal process;

      (2) If the account was frozen after the TSP record keeper received a document that purports to be a legal process requiring payment from the participant's account, the account will be unfrozen:

      (i) Upon payment pursuant to a qualifying legal process; or

      (ii) As soon as practicable after the TSP record keeper informs the parties that the document is not a qualifying legal process.

      (i) The TSP record keeper will hold in abeyance the processing of a payment required by legal process if the TSP record keeper is notified in writing that the legal process has been appealed, and that the effect of the filing of the appeal is to stay the enforceability of the legal process. The notification must be accompanied by the documentation and citations to legal authority described at § 1653.3(i).

      (j) Multiple qualifying legal processes relating to the same TSP account and received by the TSP record keeper will be processed as follows:

      (1) If the legal processes make awards to the same payee or payees and do not indicate that the awards are cumulative, the TSP record keeper will only honor the legal process bearing the latest effective date.

      (2) If the legal processes relate to different payees, the legal process will be honored:

      (i) In the order of their receipt by the TSP record keeper, if received by the TSP record keeper on different days; or

      (ii) In the order of their effective dates, if received by the TSP record keeper on the same day.

      The TSP record keeper will charge a participant a $600.00 legal process processing fee as follows:

      (a) Upon receipt of a complete legal process document (whether draft or final) and prior to reviewing order to determine whether it is a qualifying legal process, the fee will be deducted from his or her TSP account balance on a pro rata basis from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The portion of the fee deducted from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The portion of the fee deducted from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, the entire fee will be distributed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each fund or source of contributions on the day the fee is deducted; and

      (b) The fee will be charged only once per legal process. However, it will not be refunded in the event that the court order is never determined to be a qualifying legal process.

      § 1653.34   Processing Federal tax levies and criminal restitution orders.

#### § § 1653.34

      (a) The payment of tax levies and criminal restitution orders from the TSP is governed solely by the Federal Employees' Retirement Systems Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, and by the terms of this subpart. Although the TSP record keeper will honor tax levies or criminal restitution orders properly issued, those entities have no jurisdiction over the TSP and the TSP cannot be made a party to the underlying proceedings.

      (b) The TSP record keeper will review a tax levy or criminal restitution order to determine whether it is enforceable against the TSP record keeper only after it has received a complete copy of the document. Receipt by an employing agency or any other agency of the Government does not constitute receipt by the TSP record keeper. Tax levies and criminal restitution orders should be submitted to the TSP record keeper at the current address as provided at  Receipt by the TSP record keeper is considered receipt by the TSP. To be complete, a tax levy or criminal restitution order must meet all the requirements of § 1653.32 or § 1653.33; it must also provide (or be accompanied by a document or enforcement letter that provides):

      (1) The participant's TSP account number or Social Security number (SSN); and

      (2) The name and mailing address of the payee.

      (c) As soon as practicable after the TSP record keeper receives a document that purports to be a qualifying tax levy or criminal restitution order, the participant's account will be frozen. After the participant's account is frozen, no TSP withdrawal or loan disbursements will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. All other account activity will be permitted, including contributions, loan repayments, adjustments, investment elections, fund reallocations, and fund transfers. Once a disbursement from the account is made in accordance with the restitution order or levy, the hold will be removed from the participant's account.

      (d) As soon as practicable after receipt of a complete copy of a tax levy or criminal restitution order, the TSP record keeper will review it to determine whether it is qualifying as described in § 1653.32 or § 1653.33. The TSP record keeper will mail a decision letter to all parties containing the following information:

      (1) A determination regarding whether the restitution order or levy is qualifying;

      (2) A statement of the applicable statutes and regulations;

      (3) An explanation of the effect the restitution order or levy has on the participant's TSP account; and

      (4) If the qualifying restitution order or levy requires payment, the letter will provide:

      (i) An explanation of how the payment will be calculated and an estimated amount of payment;

      (ii) The anticipated date of payment.

> [87 FR 31691, May 24, 2022]

      § 1653.35   Calculating entitlement.

#### § § 1653.35

      A tax levy or criminal restitution order can only require the payment of a stated dollar amount from the TSP. The payee's entitlement will be the lesser of:

      (a) The dollar amount stated in the tax levy or enforcement letter; or

      (b) The vested account balance on the date of disbursement, minus any outstanding loan balance.

      § 1653.36   Payment.

#### § § 1653.36

      (a) Payment pursuant to a qualifying tax levy or criminal restitution order will be made 30 days after the decision letter.

      (b) In no case will payment exceed the participant's calculated entitlement.

      (c) The entire amount of a criminal restitution order or tax levy entitlement must be disbursed at one time. A series of payments will not be made. A payment pursuant to a criminal restitution order or tax levy extinguishes all rights to any further payment under that order or tax levy, even if the entire amount of the entitlement cannot be paid. Any further award must be contained in a separate criminal restitution order or tax levy.

      (d) If a participant has funds in more than one type of account, payment will be made from each account in the following order, until the amount required by the tax levy or stated in the enforcement letter is reached:

      (1) Civilian account;

      (2) Uniformed services account;

      (3) Beneficiary participant account.

      (e) Payment will be made pro rata from the participant's traditional and Roth balances. The distribution from the traditional balance will be further pro rated between the tax-deferred balance and tax-exempt balance. The payment from the Roth balance will be further pro rated between contributions in the Roth balance and earnings in the Roth balance. In addition, all payments will be distributed pro rata from all TSP core funds in which the participant's account is invested. All pro rated amounts will be based on the balances in each fund or source of contributions on the day the disbursement is made.

      (f) The payment is taxable to the participant and is subject to Federal income tax withholding. The tax withholding will be taken from the payee's entitlement and the gross amount of the payment (, the net payment distributed to the payee plus the amount withheld from the payment for taxes) will be reported to the IRS as income to the participant.

      (g) A properly paid tax levy or restitution order cannot be returned to the TSP.

      (h) The TSP will not hold a payment pending appeal of a criminal restitution order or the underlying conviction. The TSP will treat the criminal restitution order as a final judgment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3664(o) and process payment as provided by this subpart.

#### § § 1655.13

    (a) When the completed loan agreement is signed electronically or returned by the participant to the TSP record keeper, together with any documentation required to be submitted, the loan will be initially approved or denied by the TSP record keeper based upon the requirements of this part, including the following conditions:

    (1) The participant has signed the promise to repay the loan, has agreed to repay the loan through payroll deductions, and has certified that the information given is true and complete to the best of the participant's knowledge;

    (2) Processing of the loan would not be prohibited by § 1655.19 relating to court orders;

    (3) The spouse of a FERS or uniformed services participant has consented to the loan or, if the spouse's whereabouts are unknown or exceptional circumstances make it inappropriate to secure the spouse's consent, an exception to the spousal requirement described in § 1655.18 has been granted;

    (d) The loan issue date is considered to be the date the loan was made.

    (e) If a loan disbursement is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 90 days, the TSP record keeper will repay the loan with the returned loan proceeds.

    § 1655.14   Loan payments.

#### § § 1655.14

    (a) In the case of a participant who has not separated from Government service, loan payments must be made through payroll deduction in accordance with the loan agreement. Once loan payments begin, the employing agency cannot terminate the payroll deductions at the employee's request, unless the TSP or its record keeper instructs it to do so.

    (b) The participant may make additional payments by mailing a check or guaranteed funds to the TSP record keeper or by enrolling in loan direct debit repayments from his or her personal savings or checking account. If the TSP record keeper receives a payment that repays the outstanding loan amount and overpays the loan by $10.00 or more, the overpayment will be refunded to the participant. Overpayments of less than $10.00 will be applied to the participant's account and will not be refunded. If a loan overpayment refund is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 90 days, the overpayment refund will be forfeited to the TSP. The participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.

    (c) The initial payment on a loan is due on or before the 60th day following the loan issue date. Interest accrues on the loan from the date of issuance.

    (d) Subsequent payments are due at regular intervals as prescribed in the loan agreement, or most recent amortization, according to the participant's pay cycle.

    (e) In the case of a participant who has not separated from Government service, if a payment is not made when due, the TSP record keeper will notify the participant of the missed payment and the participant must make up the payment in full. The participant's make-up payment must be in the form of a check, guaranteed funds, or a one-time payment via loan direct debit from his or her personal savings or checking account. If the participant does not make up all missed payments by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the first payment was missed, the TSP record keeper will declare the loan to be a deemed distribution in accordance with § 1655.15(a). The declaration of a deemed distribution does not relieve the participant of his or her obligation to repay the amount.

    (f) Interest will accrue on all missed payments and will be included in the calculation of any deemed distribution subsequently declared in accordance with § 1655.15(a). Interest will also accrue on payments missed while a participant is in nonpay status and on any deemed distribution until it is repaid in full.

    (g) A participant who has separated from Government service with an outstanding loan balance may continue making loan repayments via check, guaranteed funds, or loan direct debit repayments. If a separated participant does not begin making post-separation loan repayments or pay off the loan in full by the deadline imposed by the TSP record keeper, the TSP record keeper will declare the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest to be a loan offset in accordance with § 1655.15(b). In the case of a separated participant who commences post-separation loan repayments, if a payment is not made when due, the TSP record keeper will notify the separated participant of the missed payment and he or she must make up the payment in full. The make-up payment must be in the form of a check, guaranteed funds, or a one-time payment via loan direct debit from his or her personal savings or checking account. If the participant does not make up all missed payments by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the first payment was missed, the TSP record keeper will declare the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest to be a loan offset in accordance with § 1655.15(b).

    § 1655.15   Deemed Distributions and Loan Offsets.

#### § § 1655.15

    (a) The TSP record keeper will ensure that all requirements set forth in section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to deemed distributions are satisfied.

    (1) The TSP record keeper will declare the entire unpaid balance of an outstanding loan (including interest) to be a deemed distribution if:

    (i) The participant misses two or more loan payments or the participant's payments are made for less than the required amount, and the delinquency is not cured within the cure period;

    (ii) The loan is not repaid in full by the maximum term limit; or

    (iii) A participant is in a confirmed nonpay status for a period of one year or more, has not advised the TSP record keeper that he or she is serving on active military duty, and payments are not resumed after the participant is notified the loan has been reamortized.

    (2) Loan taxation does not relieve a participant of his or her obligation to repay the taxed loan amount. A participant may repay a taxed loan in full (including accrued interest) via check or money order up until the time he or she separates from Government service. The tax basis in a participant's TSP account will be adjusted to reflect the repayment of a taxed loan.

    (3) If a participant does not repay a taxed loan:

    (i) His or her account balance will be permanently reduced; and

    (ii) The taxed loan will count as one of the two loans the participant is permitted per account and is treated as an outstanding loan balance when calculating the participant's maximum loan amount.

    (b) The TSP record keeper will ensure that all requirements set forth in section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to loan offsets are satisfied.

    (1) The TSP record keeper will declare a loan offset in the following situations:

    (i) A participant separates from Government service and does not begin making loan repayments or repay the outstanding loan principal and interest in full within the period specified by the notice to the participant from the TSP record keeper explaining the participant's repayment options; or

    (ii) The participant dies.

    (2) [Reserved]

    (c) If a deemed distribution or loan offset occurs in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable, the TSP record keeper will notify the participant of the amount and date of the distribution. The TSP record keeper will report the distribution to the Internal Revenue Service as income for the year in which it occurs.

    (d) If a participant dies and a loan offset occurs in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the TSP record keeper will notify the participant's estate of the amount and date of the distribution. Neither the estate nor any other person, including a beneficiary, may repay the loan of a deceased participant, nor can the funds be returned to the TSP.

    (e) If, because of Board or TSP record keeper error, a TSP loan is declared a deemed distribution or loan offset under circumstances that make such a declaration inconsistent with this part, or inconsistent with other procedures established by the Board or TSP record keeper in connection with the TSP loan program, the distribution will be reversed. The participant will be provided an opportunity to reinstate loan payments or repay in full the outstanding balance on the loan.

> [87 FR 31693, May 24, 2022]

    § 1655.16   Reamortization.

#### § § 1655.16

    (a) When a participant's pay cycle changes for any reason, he or she must notify the TSP record keeper of the change in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Upon notification, the participant's loan will be reamortized to adjust the scheduled payment to an equivalent amount in the new pay cycle. If the new pay cycle results in fewer payments per year and the participant does not reamortize the loan, the loan may be declared a deemed distribution pursuant to § 1655.15(a)(1).

    (b) Upon reamortization, the outstanding principal balance remains the same. Any accrued interest is paid off first before payments are applied to principal and current interest.

    (c) The interest rate on a reamortized loan will be the same as the interest rate on the original loan.

> [87 FR 31694, May 24, 2022]

    § 1655.17   Prepayment.

#### § § 1655.17

    (a) A participant may repay a loan in full, without a penalty, at any time before the declaration of a deemed distribution or loan foreclosure under § 1655.15. Repayment in full means receipt by the TSP record keeper of a payment, by check or guaranteed funds made payable to the Thrift Savings Plan or via loan direct debit repayments, of all principal and interest due on the loan.

    (b) If a participant returns a loan check to the TSP record keeper, it will be treated as a repayment; however, additional interest may be owed, which, if not paid, could result in a deemed distribution. The loan, even though repaid, will also be taken into account in determining the maximum amount available for future loans, in accordance with § 1655.6(b).

    (c) The amount outstanding on a loan can be obtained from the TSP website, the ThriftLine, or by a written request to the TSP record keeper.

    (2) A CSRS participant may obtain an exception to the requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Executive Director, that the spouse's whereabouts are unknown as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

    (b)  (1) Before a loan agreement is approved for a FERS or uniformed services participant, the spouse must consent to the loan by signing the loan agreement.

    (2) A FERS or uniformed services participant may obtain an exception to the requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Executive Director, that:

    (i) The spouse's whereabouts are unknown; or

    (ii) Exceptional circumstances prevent the participant from obtaining the spouse's consent.

    (c)  The procedures for obtaining an exception to the spousal requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section are the same as the procedures described in 5 CFR part 1650, subpart G.

    (d)  By completing a loan request, the participant certifies, under penalty of perjury, that all information provided to the TSP record keeper during the loan process is true and complete, including statements concerning the participant's marital status, the spouse's email or physical address at the time the application is filed, or the current spouse's consent to the loan.

    § 1655.19   Effect of court order on loan.

#### § § 1655.19

    Upon receipt of a document that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order, qualifying legal process relating to a participant's legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments, or a qualifying child abuse order, the participant's TSP account will be frozen. After the account is frozen, no loan will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. The Board's procedures for processing court orders and legal processes are explained in 5 CFR part 1653.

    § 1655.20   Residential loans.

#### § § 1655.20

    (a) A residential loan will be made only for the purchase or construction of the primary residence of the participant, or for the participant and his or her spouse, and for the amount required to close on the purchase. The participant must actually bear all or part of the cost of the purchase. If the participant purchases a primary residence with someone other than his or her spouse, only the portion of the purchase costs that is borne by the participant will be considered in making the loan. A residential loan will not be made for the purpose of paying off an existing mortgage or otherwise providing financing for a previously purchased primary residence.

    (b) The participant's primary residence is his or her principal residence. A primary residence may include a house, a townhouse, a condominium, a share in a cooperative housing corporation, or a mobile home; a primary residence does not include a second home or vacation home. A participant cannot have more than one primary residence.

    (c) Purchase of a primary residence means acquisition of the residence through the exchange of cash or other property or through the total construction of a new residence. A residential loan will not be made for a lease-to-buy option, unless the option to buy is being exercised and the documentation states that the funds are being used to purchase the primary residence. Construction of an addition to or the renovation of a residence or the purchase of land only does not constitute the purchase of a primary residence.

    (d) The amount required to close on the purchase of a primary residence does not include points or loan origination fees charged for a loan. In addition, real estate taxes cannot be included.

    (e) The documentation required for a loan under this section is as follows:

      § 1690.13   Guardianship and conservatorship orders.

#### § § 1690.13

      (a) A court order can authorize an agent to conduct business with the TSP on behalf of an incapacitated participant or beneficiary. The agent is called a guardian or conservator and the incapacitated person is called a ward. The TSP record keeper must approve a court order before an agent can conduct business with the TSP; however, the TSP record keeper will accept a document that was signed by the agent before the TSP record keeper approved the court order. The TSP record keeper will approve a court order appointing an agent if the following conditions are met:

      (1) A court of competent jurisdiction (as defined at § 1690.1) must have issued the court order;

      (2) The court order must give the agent either general or specific powers, as explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; and

      (3) The agent must demonstrate that he or she meets any precondition specified in the court order, such as a bonding requirement.

      (b) A general grant of authority gives a guardian or conservator unlimited authority to conduct business with the TSP, including the authority to sign any TSP-related document. By way of example, an order gives a general grant authority by appointing a “guardian of the ward's estate,” by permitting a guardian to “conduct business transactions” for the ward, or by authorizing a guardian to care for the ward's “personal property” or “Federal Government retirement benefits.”

      (c) A specific grant of authority gives a guardian or conservator authority to conduct specific TSP transactions. Such an order must expressly describe the authority it grants. By way of example, an order may authorize an agent to “obtain information about the ward's TSP account” or “borrow or withdraw funds from the ward's TSP account.”

#### § § 1690.14

      (a)  The TSP does not agree to accept less than the total amount due by negotiating an instrument such as a check, share draft or money order with a restrictive legend on it (such as “payment in full” or “submitted in full satisfaction of claims”), or by negotiating an instrument that is conditionally tendered to the TSP with an offer of compromise.

      (b)  The TSP record keeper has established an address for the receipt of specified TSP payments. The TSP record keeper will not answer correspondence mailed to that payment address.

      § 1690.15   Freezing an account—administrative holds.

#### § § 1690.15

      (a) The TSP record keeper may freeze (e.g., place an administrative hold on) a participant's account for any of the following reasons:

      (1) Pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order as set forth in part 1653 of this chapter;

      (2) Pursuant to a request from the Department of Justice under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act;

      (3) Upon the death of a participant;

      (4) Upon suspicion or knowledge of fraudulent account activity or identity theft;

      (5) In response to litigation pertaining to an account;

      (6) For operational reasons (e.g., to correct a processing error or to stop payment on a check when account funds are insufficient);

      (7) Pursuant to a written request from a participant made in the manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper; and

      (8) For any other reason necessary to ensure the integrity of TSP accounts or compliance with law.
