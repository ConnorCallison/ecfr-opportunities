## Subchapter A

    PART 2—CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PATIENT RECORDS

### Part 2

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2; 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2 note.

**Source:** Source: 82 FR 6115, Jan. 18, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Introduction

        § 2.1   Statutory authority for confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records.

#### § § 2.1

        Title 42, United States Code, section 290dd-2(g) authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of section 290dd-2. Such regulations may contain such definitions, and may provide for such safeguards and procedures, including procedures and criteria for the issuance and scope of orders under subsection 290dd-2(b)(2)(C), as in the judgment of the Secretary are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of section 290dd-2, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.

        § 2.2   Purpose and effect.

#### § § 2.2

        (a)  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2(g), the regulations in this part impose restrictions upon the use and disclosure of substance use disorder patient records (“records,” as defined in this part) which are maintained in connection with the performance of any part 2 program. The regulations in this part include the following subparts:

        (1) Subpart B: General Provisions, including definitions, applicability, and general restrictions;

        (2) Subpart C: Uses and Disclosures With Patient Consent, including uses and disclosures that require patient consent and the consent form requirements;

        (3) Subpart D: Uses and Disclosures Without Patient Consent, including uses and disclosures which do not require patient consent or an authorizing court order; and

        (4) Subpart E: Court Orders Authorizing Use and Disclosure, including uses and disclosures of records which may be made with an authorizing court order and the procedures and criteria for the entry and scope of those orders.

        (b)  (1) The regulations in this part prohibit the use and disclosure of records unless certain circumstances exist. If any circumstance exists under which use or disclosure is permitted, that circumstance acts to remove the prohibition on use and disclosure but it does not compel the use or disclosure. Thus, the regulations in this part do not require use or disclosure under any circumstance other than when disclosure is required by the Secretary to investigate or determine a person's compliance with this part pursuant to § 2.3(c).

        (2) The regulations in this part are not intended to direct the manner in which substantive functions such as research, treatment, and evaluation are carried out. They are intended to ensure that a patient receiving treatment for a substance use disorder in a part 2 program is not made more vulnerable by reason of the availability of their record than an individual with a substance use disorder who does not seek treatment.

        (3) The regulations in this part shall not be construed to limit:

        (i) A patient's right, as described in 45 CFR 164.522, to request a restriction on the use or disclosure of a record for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations.

        (ii) A covered entity's choice, as described in 45 CFR 164.506, to obtain the consent of the patient to use or disclose a record to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations.

> [89 FR 12618, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 2.3   Civil and criminal penalties for violations.

#### § § 2.3

        (a)  Any person who violates any provision of 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2(a)-(d), shall be subject to the applicable penalties under sections 1176 and 1177 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-5 and 1320d-6.

        (b)  A person who is acting on behalf of an investigative agency having jurisdiction over the activities of a part 2 program or other person holding records under this part (or employees or agents of that part 2 program or person holding the records) shall not incur civil or criminal liability under 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2(f) for use or disclosure of such records inconsistent with this part that occurs while acting within the scope of their employment in the course of investigating or prosecuting a part 2 program or person holding the record, if the person or investigative agency demonstrates that the following conditions are met:

        (1) Before presenting a request, subpoena, or other demand for records, or placing an undercover agent or informant in a health care practice or provider, as applicable, such person acted with reasonable diligence to determine whether the regulations in this part apply to the records, part 2 program, or other person holding records under this part. Reasonable diligence means taking all of the following actions where it is reasonable to believe that the practice or provider provides substance use disorder diagnostic, treatment, or referral for treatment services:

        (i) Searching for the practice or provider among the substance use disorder treatment facilities in the online treatment locator maintained by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

        (ii) Searching in a similar state database of treatment facilities where available.

        (iii) Checking a provider's publicly available website, where available, or its physical location to determine whether in fact such services are provided.

        (iv) Viewing the provider's Patient Notice or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) if it is available online or at the physical location.

        (v) Taking all these actions within a reasonable period of time (no more than 60 days) before requesting records from, or placing an undercover agent or informant in, a health care practice or provider.

        (2) The person followed all of the applicable provisions in this part for any use or disclosure of the received records under this part that occurred, or will occur, after the person or investigative agency knew, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that it received records under this part.

        (c)  The provisions of 45 CFR part 160, subparts C, D, and E, shall apply to noncompliance with this part in the same manner as they apply to covered entities and business associates for noncompliance with 45 CFR parts 160 and 164.

> [89 FR 12618, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 2.4   Complaints of noncompliance.

#### § § 2.4

        (a)  A part 2 program must provide a process to receive complaints concerning the program's compliance with the requirements of this part.

        (b)  A person may file a complaint to the Secretary for a violation of this part by a part 2 program, covered entity, business associate, qualified service organization, or lawful holder in the same manner as a person may file a complaint under 45 CFR 160.306 for a violation of the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.

        (c)  A part 2 program may not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any patient for the exercise by the patient of any right established, or for participation in any process provided for, by this part, including the filing of a complaint under this section or § 2.3(c).

        (d)  A part 2 program may not require patients to waive their right to file a complaint under this section or § 2.3 as a condition of the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for any program subject to this part.

        § 2.12   Applicability.

#### § § 2.12

        (a) — (1)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part apply to any records which:

        (i) Would identify a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person; and

        (ii) Contain substance use disorder information obtained by a federally assisted substance use disorder program after March 20, 1972 (part 2 program), or contain alcohol use disorder information obtained by a federally assisted alcohol use disorder or substance use disorder program after May 13, 1974 (part 2 program); or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by a part 2 program after that date as part of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date; for the purpose of treating a substance use disorder, making a diagnosis for that treatment, or making a referral for that treatment.

        (2)  The restriction on use or disclosure of information to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against a patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of a patient (42 U.S.C. 290dd-2(c)) applies to any information, whether or not recorded, which is substance use disorder information obtained by a federally assisted substance use disorder program after March 20, 1972 (part 2 program), or is alcohol use disorder information obtained by a federally assisted alcohol use disorder or substance use disorder program after May 13, 1974 (part 2 program); or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by a part 2 program after that date as part of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date; for the purpose of treating a substance use disorder, making a diagnosis for the treatment, or making a referral for the treatment.

        (b)  A program is considered to be federally assisted if:

        (1) It is conducted in whole or in part, whether directly or by contract or otherwise by any department or agency of the United States (but see paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section relating to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Uniformed Services);

        (2) It is being carried out under a license, certification, registration, or other authorization granted by any department or agency of the United States including but not limited to:

        (i) Participating provider in the Medicare program;

        (ii) Authorization to conduct maintenance treatment or withdrawal management; or

        (iii) Registration to dispense a substance under the Controlled Substances Act to the extent the controlled substance is used in the treatment of substance use disorders;

        (3) It is supported by funds provided by any department or agency of the United States by being:

        (i) A recipient of federal financial assistance in any form, including financial assistance which does not directly pay for the substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment; or

        (ii) Conducted by a state or local government unit which, through general or special revenue sharing or other forms of assistance, receives federal funds which could be (but are not necessarily) spent for the substance use disorder program; or

        (4) It is assisted by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury through the allowance of income tax deductions for contributions to the program or through the granting of tax exempt status to the program.

        (c) — (1)  These regulations do not apply to information on substance use disorder patients maintained in connection with the Department of Veterans Affairs' provision of hospital care, nursing home care, domiciliary care, and medical services under Title 38, U.S.C. Those records are governed by 38 U.S.C. 7332 and regulations issued under that authority by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

        (2)  The regulations in this part apply to any information described in paragraph (a) of this section which was obtained by any component of the Uniformed Services during a period when the patient was subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice except:

        (i) Any interchange of that information within the Uniformed Services and within those components of the Department of Veterans Affairs furnishing health care to veterans; and

        (ii) Any interchange of that information between such components and the Uniformed Services.

        (3)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part do not apply to communications of information between or among personnel having a need for the information in connection with their duties that arise out of the provision of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of patients with substance use disorders if the communications are:

        (i) Within a part 2 program; or

        (ii) Between a part 2 program and an entity that has direct administrative control over the program.

        (4)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part do not apply to the communications between a part 2 program and a qualified service organization of information needed by the qualified service organization to provide services to or on behalf of the program.

        (5)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part do not apply to communications from part 2 program personnel to law enforcement agencies or officials which:

        (i) Are directly related to a patient's commission of a crime on the premises of the part 2 program or against part 2 program personnel or to a threat to commit such a crime; and

        (ii) Are limited to the circumstances of the incident, including the patient status of the individual committing or threatening to commit the crime, that individual's name and address, and that individual's last known whereabouts.

        (6)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part do not apply to the reporting under state law of incidents of suspected child abuse and neglect to the appropriate state or local authorities. However, the restrictions continue to apply to the original substance use disorder patient records maintained by the part 2 program including their use and disclosure for civil or criminal proceedings which may arise out of the report of suspected child abuse and neglect.

        (d) —  (1)  The restriction on the use and disclosure of any record subject to the regulations in this part to initiate or substantiate criminal charges against a patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of a patient, or to use in any civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings against a patient, applies to any person who obtains the record from a part 2 program, covered entity, business associate, intermediary, or other lawful holder, regardless of the status of the person obtaining the record or whether the record was obtained in accordance with subpart E of this part. This restriction on use and disclosure bars, among other things, the introduction into evidence of a record or testimony in any criminal prosecution or civil action before a Federal or state court, reliance on the record or testimony to inform any decision or otherwise be taken into account in any proceeding before a Federal, state, or local agency, the use of such record or testimony by any Federal, state, or local agency for a law enforcement purpose or to conduct any law enforcement investigation, and the use of such record or testimony in any application for a warrant, absent patient consent or a court order in accordance with subpart E of this part. Records obtained by undercover agents or informants, § 2.17, or through patient access, § 2.23, are subject to the restrictions on uses and disclosures.

        (2) —(i)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part apply to:

        (A) Third-party payers, as defined in this part, with regard to records disclosed to them by part 2 programs or under § 2.31(a)(4)(i);

        (B) Persons having direct administrative control over part 2 programs with regard to information that is subject to the regulations in this part communicated to them by the part 2 program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

        (C) Persons who receive records directly from a part 2 program, covered entity, business associate, intermediary, or other lawful holder of patient identifying information and who are notified of the prohibition on redisclosure in accordance with § 2.32. A part 2 program, covered entity, or business associate that receives records based on a single consent for all treatment, payment, and health care operations is not required to segregate or segment such records.

        (ii)  Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section, a treating provider who is not subject to this part may record information about a SUD and its treatment that identifies a patient. This is permitted and does not constitute a record that has been redisclosed under this part. The act of recording information about a SUD and its treatment does not by itself render a medical record which is created by a treating provider who is not subject to this part, subject to the restrictions of this part.

        (e) —(1)  These regulations cover any information (including information on referral and intake) about patients receiving diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment for a substance use disorder created by a part 2 program. Coverage includes, but is not limited to, those treatment or rehabilitation programs, employee assistance programs, programs within general hospitals, school-based programs, and private practitioners who hold themselves out as providing, and provide substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment. However, the regulations in this part would not apply, for example, to emergency room personnel who refer a patient to the intensive care unit for an apparent overdose, unless the primary function of such personnel is the provision of substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment and they are identified as providing such services or the emergency room has promoted itself to the community as a provider of such services.

        (2)  If a patient's substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment is not provided by a part 2 program, that patient's record is not covered by the regulations in this part. Thus, it is possible for an individual patient to benefit from federal support and not be covered by the confidentiality regulations because the program in which the patient is enrolled is not federally assisted as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. For example, if a federal court placed an individual in a private for-profit program and made a payment to the program on behalf of that individual, that patient's record would not be covered by the regulations in this part unless the program itself received federal assistance as defined by paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3)  Whether a restriction applies to the use or disclosure of a record affects the type of records which may be disclosed. The restrictions on use and disclosure apply to any records which would identify a specified patient as having or having had a substance use disorder. The restriction on use and disclosure of records to bring a civil action or criminal charges against a patient in any civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings applies to any records obtained by the part 2 program for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of patients with substance use disorders. (Restrictions on use and disclosure apply to recipients of records as specified under paragraph (d) of this section.)

        (4)  These regulations cover any record reflecting a diagnosis identifying a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder which is initially prepared by a part 2 program in connection with the treatment or referral for treatment of a patient with a substance use disorder. A diagnosis prepared by a part 2 program for the purpose of treatment or referral for treatment, but which is not so used, is covered by the regulations in this part. The following are not covered by the regulations in this part:

        (i) Diagnosis which is made on behalf of and at the request of a law enforcement agency or official or a court of competent jurisdiction solely for the purpose of providing evidence; or

        (ii) A diagnosis of drug overdose or alcohol intoxication which clearly shows that the individual involved does not have a substance use disorder ( involuntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs or reaction to a prescribed dosage of one or more drugs).

        § 2.13   Confidentiality restrictions and safeguards.

#### § § 2.13

        (a)  The patient records subject to the regulations in this part may be used or disclosed only as permitted by the regulations in this part and may not otherwise be used or disclosed in any civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings conducted by any Federal, state, or local authority. Any use or disclosure made under the regulations in this part must be limited to that information which is necessary to carry out the purpose of the use or disclosure.

        (b)  The restrictions on use and disclosure in the regulations in this part apply whether or not the part 2 program or other lawful holder of the patient identifying information believes that the person seeking the information already has it, has other means of obtaining it, is a law enforcement agency or official or other government official, has obtained a subpoena, or asserts any other justification for a use or disclosure which is not permitted by the regulations in this part.

        (c) (1) The presence of an identified patient in a health care facility or component of a health care facility that is publicly identified as a place where only substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment is provided may be acknowledged only if the patient's written consent is obtained in accordance with subpart C of this part or if an authorizing court order is entered in accordance with subpart E of this part. The regulations permit acknowledgment of the presence of an identified patient in a health care facility or part of a health care facility if the health care facility is not publicly identified as only a substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment facility, and if the acknowledgment does not reveal that the patient has a substance use disorder.

        (2) Any answer to a request for a disclosure of patient records which is not permissible under the regulations in this part must be made in a way that will not affirmatively reveal that an identified individual has been, or is being, diagnosed or treated for a substance use disorder. An inquiring party may be provided a copy of the regulations in this part and advised that they restrict the disclosure of substance use disorder patient records, but may not be told affirmatively that the regulations restrict the disclosure of the records of an identified patient.

        § 2.14   Minor patients.

#### § § 2.14

        (a)  If a minor patient acting alone has the legal capacity under the applicable state law to apply for and obtain substance use disorder treatment, any written consent for use or disclosure authorized under subpart C of this part may be given only by the minor patient. This restriction includes, but is not limited to, any disclosure of patient identifying information to the parent or guardian of a minor patient for the purpose of obtaining financial reimbursement. The regulations in this paragraph (a) do not prohibit a part 2 program from refusing to provide treatment until the minor patient consents to a use or disclosure that is necessary to obtain reimbursement, but refusal to provide treatment may be prohibited under a state or local law requiring the program to furnish the service irrespective of ability to pay.

        (b)   (1) Where state law requires consent of a parent, guardian, or other person for a minor to obtain treatment for a substance use disorder, any written consent for use or disclosure authorized under subpart C of this part must be given by both the minor and their parent, guardian, or other person authorized under state law to act on the minor's behalf.

        (2) Where state law requires parental consent to treatment, the fact of a minor's application for treatment may be communicated to the minor's parent, guardian, or other person authorized under state law to act on the minor's behalf only if:

        (i) The minor has given written consent to the disclosure in accordance with subpart C of this part; or

        (ii) The minor lacks the capacity to make a rational choice regarding such consent as determined by the part 2 program director under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  Facts relevant to reducing a substantial threat to the life or physical well-being of the minor applicant or any other person may be disclosed to the parent, guardian, or other person authorized under state law to act on the minor's behalf if the part 2 program director determines that:

        (1) A minor applicant for services lacks capacity because of extreme youth or mental or physical condition to make a rational decision on whether to consent to a disclosure under subpart C of this part to their parent, guardian, or other person authorized under state law to act on the minor's behalf; and

        (2) The minor applicant's situation poses a substantial threat to the life or physical well-being of the minor applicant or any other person which may be reduced by communicating relevant facts to the minor's parent, guardian, or other person authorized under state law to act on the minor's behalf.

        § 2.15   Patients who lack capacity and deceased patients.

#### § § 2.15

        (a) —(1)  In the case of a patient who has been adjudicated as lacking the capacity, for any reason other than insufficient age, to make their own health care decisions, any consent which is required under the regulations in this part may be given by the personal representative.

        (2)  In the case of a patient, other than a minor or one who has been adjudicated as lacking the capacity to make health care decisions, that for any period suffers from a medical condition that prevents knowing or effective action on their own behalf, the part 2 program director may exercise the right of the patient to consent to a use or disclosure under subpart C of this part for the sole purpose of obtaining payment for services from a third-party payer or health plan.

        (b) —(1)  These regulations do not restrict the disclosure of patient identifying information relating to the cause of death of a patient under laws requiring the collection of death or other vital statistics or permitting inquiry into the cause of death.

        (2)  Any other use or disclosure of information identifying a deceased patient as having a substance use disorder is subject to the regulations in this part. If a written consent to the use or disclosure is required, that consent may be given by the personal representative.

        § 2.16   Security for records and notification of breaches.

#### § § 2.16

        (a) The part 2 program or other lawful holder of patient identifying information must have in place formal policies and procedures to reasonably protect against unauthorized uses and disclosures of patient identifying information and to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of patient identifying information.

        (1)  These policies and procedures must address all of the following:

        (i) Paper records, including:

        (A) Transferring and removing such records;

        (B) Destroying such records, including sanitizing the hard copy media associated with the paper printouts, to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable;

        (C) Maintaining such records in a secure room, locked file cabinet, safe, or other similar container, or storage facility when not in use;

        (D) Using and accessing workstations, secure rooms, locked file cabinets, safes, or other similar containers, and storage facilities that use or store such information; and

        (E) Rendering patient identifying information de-identified in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR 164.514(b) such that there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify a particular patient.

        (ii) Electronic records, including:

        (A) Creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting such records;

        (B) Destroying such records, including sanitizing the electronic media on which such records are stored, to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable;

        (C) Using and accessing electronic records or other electronic media containing patient identifying information; and

        (D) Rendering the patient identifying information de-identified in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR 164.514(b) such that there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify a patient.

        (2)  Family, friends, and other informal caregivers who are lawful holders as defined in this part are not required to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (b) The provisions of 45 CFR part 160 and subpart D of 45 CFR part 164 shall apply to part 2 programs with respect to breaches of unsecured records in the same manner as those provisions apply to a covered entity with respect to breaches of unsecured protected health information.

        § 2.17   Undercover agents and informants.

#### § § 2.17

        (a)  Except as specifically authorized by a court order granted under § 2.67, no part 2 program may knowingly employ, or enroll as a patient, any undercover agent or informant.

        (b)  No information obtained by an undercover agent or informant, whether or not that undercover agent or informant is placed in a part 2 program pursuant to an authorizing court order, may be used or disclosed to criminally investigate or prosecute any patient.

        § 2.18   Restrictions on the use of identification cards.

#### § § 2.18

        No person may require any patient to carry in their immediate possession while away from the part 2 program premises any card or other object which would identify the patient as having a substance use disorder. This section does not prohibit a person from requiring patients to use or carry cards or other identification objects on the premises of a part 2 program.

        § 2.19   Disposition of records by discontinued programs.

#### § § 2.19

        (a)  If a part 2 program discontinues operations or is taken over or acquired by another program, it must remove patient identifying information from its records or destroy its records, including sanitizing any associated hard copy or electronic media, to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures established under § 2.16, unless:

        (1) The patient who is the subject of the records gives written consent (meeting the requirements of § 2.31) to a transfer of the records to the acquiring program or to any other program designated in the consent (the manner of obtaining this consent must minimize the likelihood of a disclosure of patient identifying information to a third party);

        (2) There is a legal requirement that the records be kept for a period specified by law which does not expire until after the discontinuation or acquisition of the part 2 program; or

        (3) The part 2 program is transferred, retroceded, or reassumed pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 5301  and its implementing regulations in 25 CFR part 900.

        (b)  If paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies:

        (1) Records in non-electronic ( paper) form must be:

        (i) Sealed in envelopes or other containers labeled as follows: “Records of [insert name of program] required to be maintained under [insert citation to statute, regulation, court order or other legal authority requiring that records be kept] until a date not later than [insert appropriate date]”.

        (A) All hard copy media from which the paper records were produced, such as printer and facsimile ribbons, drums, etc., must be sanitized to render the data non-retrievable.

        (B) [Reserved]

        (ii) Held under the restrictions of the regulations in this part by a responsible person who must, as soon as practicable after the end of the required retention period specified on the label, destroy the records and sanitize any associated hard copy media to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable in a manner consistent with the discontinued program's or acquiring program's policies and procedures established under § 2.16.

        (2) All of the following requirements apply to records in electronic form:

        (i) Records must be:

        (A) Transferred to a portable electronic device with implemented encryption to encrypt the data at rest so that there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and implemented access controls for the confidential process or key; or

        (B) Transferred, along with a backup copy, to separate electronic media, so that both the records and the backup copy have implemented encryption to encrypt the data at rest so that there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and implemented access controls for the confidential process or key.

        (ii) Within one year of the discontinuation or acquisition of the program, all electronic media on which the patient records or patient identifying information resided prior to being transferred to the device specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section or the original and backup electronic media specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, including email and other electronic communications, must be sanitized to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable in a manner consistent with the discontinued program's or acquiring program's policies and procedures established under § 2.16.

        (iii) The portable electronic device or the original and backup electronic media must be:

        (A) Sealed in a container along with any equipment needed to read or access the information, and labeled as follows: “Records of [insert name of program] required to be maintained under [insert citation to statute, regulation, court order or other legal authority requiring that records be kept] until a date not later than [insert appropriate date];” and

        (B) Held under the restrictions of the regulations in this part by a responsible person who must store the container in a manner that will protect the information ( climate-controlled environment).

        (iv) The responsible person must be included on the access control list and be provided a means for decrypting the data. The responsible person must store the decryption tools on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt.

        (v) As soon as practicable after the end of the required retention period specified on the label, the portable electronic device or the original and backup electronic media must be sanitized to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable consistent with the policies established under § 2.16.

        § 2.20   Relationship to state laws.

#### § § 2.20

        The statute authorizing the regulations in this part (42 U.S.C. 290dd-2) does not preempt the field of law which they cover to the exclusion of all state laws in that field. If a use or disclosure permitted under the regulations in this part is prohibited under state law, neither the regulations in this part nor the authorizing statute may be construed to authorize any violation of that state law. However, no state law may either authorize or compel any use or disclosure prohibited by the regulations in this part.

        § 2.21   Relationship to federal statutes protecting research subjects against compulsory disclosure of their identity.

#### § § 2.21

        (a)  There may be concurrent coverage of patient identifying information by the regulations in this part and by administrative action taken under section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 872(c) and the implementing regulations at 21 CFR part 1316); or section 301(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241(d) and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 2a). These research privilege statutes confer on the Secretary of Health and Human Services and on the Attorney General, respectively, the power to authorize researchers conducting certain types of research to withhold from all persons not connected with the research the names and other identifying information concerning individuals who are the subjects of the research.

        (b)  The regulations in this part restrict the use and disclosure of information about patients, while administrative action taken under the research privilege statutes and implementing regulations in paragraph (a) of this section protects a person engaged in applicable research from being compelled to disclose any identifying characteristics of the individuals who are the subjects of that research. The issuance under subpart E of this part of a court order authorizing a disclosure of information about a patient does not affect an exercise of authority under these research privilege statutes.

        () Records shall only be used or disclosed based on a court order after notice and an opportunity to be heard is provided to the patient or the holder of the record, where required by 4_2_ U.S.C. 290dd-2 and this part; and

        () A court order authorizing use or disclosure must be accompanied by a subpoena or other similar legal mandate compelling disclosure before the record is used or disclosed.

        (iii)  If the part 2 program intends to engage in any of the following activities, the description required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section must include a separate statement as follows:

        (A) Records that are disclosed to a part 2 program, covered entity, or business associate pursuant to the patient's written consent for treatment, payment, and health care operations may be further disclosed by that part 2 program, covered entity, or business associate, without the patient's written consent, to the extent the HIPAA regulations permit such disclosure.

        (B) A part 2 program may use or disclose records to fundraise for the benefit of the part 2 program only if the patient is first provided with a clear and conspicuous opportunity to elect not to receive fundraising communications.

        (iv)  The notice must contain a statement of the patient's rights with respect to their records and a brief description of how the patient may exercise these rights, as follows:

        (D) Right to a list of disclosures by an intermediary for the past 3 years as provided in § 2.24.

        (E) Right to obtain a paper or electronic copy of the notice from the part 2 program upon request.

        (F) Right to discuss the notice with a designated contact person or office identified by the part 2 program pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section.

        (G) Right to elect not to receive fundraising communications.

        (v)  The notice must contain:

        (2)  (i) In addition to the content required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if a part 2 program elects to limit the uses or disclosures that it is permitted to make under this part, the part 2 program may describe its more limited uses or disclosures in its notice, provided that the part 2 program may not include in its notice a limitation affecting its right to make a use or disclosure that is required by law or permitted to be made for emergency treatment.

        (ii) For the part 2 program to apply a change in its more limited uses and disclosures to records created or received prior to issuing a revised notice, the notice must include the statements required by paragraph (b)(1)(v)(C) of this section.

        (3)  The part 2 program must promptly revise and distribute its notice whenever there is a material change to the uses or disclosures, the patient's rights, the part 2 program's legal duties, or other privacy practices stated in the notice. Except when required by law, a material change to any term of the notice may not be implemented prior to the effective date of the notice in which such material change is reflected.

        (c)  A part 2 program must make the notice required by this section available upon request to any person and to any patient; and

        (1) A part 2 program must provide the notice:

        (3) Specific requirements for electronic notice include all the following:

        (i) A part 2 program that maintains a website that provides information about the part 2 program's customer services or benefits must prominently post its notice on the website and make the notice available electronically through the website.

        (ii) A part 2 program may provide the notice required by this section to a patient by email, if the patient agrees to electronic notice and such agreement has not been withdrawn. If the part 2 program knows that the email transmission has failed, a paper copy of the notice must be provided to the patient. Provision of electronic notice by the part 2 program will satisfy the provision requirements of this paragraph (c) when timely made in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

        (iii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if the first service delivery to an individual is delivered electronically, the part 2 program must provide electronic notice automatically and contemporaneously in response to the individual's first request for service. The requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section apply to electronic notice.

        (iv) The patient who is the recipient of electronic notice retains the right to obtain a paper copy of the notice from a part 2 program upon request.

        (1) The patient agrees to or requests the termination in writing.

        (2) The patient orally agrees to the termination and the oral agreement is documented.

        (3) The part 2 program informs the patient that it is terminating its agreement to a restriction, except that such termination is:

      Subpart C—Uses and Disclosures With Patient Consent

        § 2.31   Consent requirements.

#### § § 2.31

        (a)  A written consent to a use or disclosure under the regulations in this part may be paper or electronic and must include:

        (1) The name of the patient.

        (2) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, authorized to make the requested use or disclosure.

        (3) A description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion.

        (4)(i)  The name(s) of the person(s), or class of persons, to which a disclosure is to be made (“recipient(s)”). For a single consent for all future uses and disclosures for treatment, payment, and health care operations, the recipient may be described as “my treating providers, health plans, third-party payers, and people helping to operate this program” or a similar statement.

        (ii)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, if the recipient entity is an intermediary, a written consent must include the name(s) of the intermediary(ies) and:

        (A) The name(s) of the member participants of the intermediary; or

        (B) A general designation of a participant(s) or class of participants, which must be limited to a participant(s) who has a treating provider relationship with the patient whose information is being used or disclosed.

        (iii)  If the recipient is a covered entity or business associate to whom a record (or information contained in a record) is disclosed for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations, a written consent must include the statement that the patient's record (or information contained in the record) may be redisclosed in accordance with the permissions contained in the HIPAA regulations, except for uses and disclosures for civil, criminal, administrative, and legislative proceedings against the patient.

        (5) A description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure.

        (i) The statement “at the request of the patient” is a sufficient description of the purpose when a patient initiates the consent and does not, or elects not to, provide a statement of the purpose.

        (ii) The statement, “for treatment, payment, and health care operations” is a sufficient description of the purpose when a patient provides consent once for all such future uses or disclosures for those purposes.

        (iii) If a part 2 program intends to use or disclose records to fundraise on its own behalf, a statement about the patient's right to elect not to receive any fundraising communications.

        (6) The patient's right to revoke the consent in writing, except to the extent that the part 2 program or other lawful holder of patient identifying information that is permitted to make the disclosure has already acted in reliance on it, and how the patient may revoke consent.

        (7) An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the individual patient or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement “end of the treatment,” “none,” or similar language is sufficient if the consent is for a use or disclosure for treatment, payment, or health care operations. The statement “end of the research study” or similar language is sufficient if the consent is for a use or disclosure for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository.

        (8) The signature of the patient and, when required for a patient who is a minor, the signature of a person authorized to give consent under § 2.14; or, when required for a patient who has been adjudicated as lacking the capacity to make their own health care decisions or is deceased, the signature of a person authorized to sign under § 2.15. Electronic signatures are permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any applicable law.

        (9) The date on which the consent is signed.

        (10) A patient's written consent to use or disclose records for treatment, payment, or health care operations must include all of the following statements:

        (i) The potential for the records used or disclosed pursuant to the consent to be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer protected by this part.

        (ii) The consequences to the patient of a refusal to sign the consent.

        (b)  (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, a part 2 program must obtain consent for any use or disclosure of SUD counseling notes, except:

        (i) To carry out the following treatment, payment, or health care operations:

        (A) Use by the originator of the SUD counseling notes for treatment;

        (B) Use or disclosure by the part 2 program for its own training programs in which students, trainees, or practitioners in SUD treatment or mental health learn under supervision to practice or improve their skills in group, joint, family, or individual SUD counseling; or

        (ii) A use or disclosure that is required by § 2.2(b) or permitted by § 2.15(b); § 2.53 with respect to the oversight of the originator of the SUD counseling notes; § 2.63(a); § 2.64.

        (2) A written consent for a use or disclosure of SUD counseling notes may only be combined with another written consent for a use or disclosure of SUD counseling notes.

        (3) A part 2 program may not condition the provision to a patient of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits on the provision of a written consent for a use or disclosure of SUD counseling notes.

        (c)  A disclosure may not be made on the basis of a consent which:

        (1) Has expired;

        (2) On its face substantially fails to conform to any of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (3) Is known to have been revoked; or

        § 2.32   Notice and copy of consent to accompany disclosure.

#### § § 2.32

        (a) Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements ( paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section):

        (1)

        This record which has been disclosed to you is protected by Federal confidentiality rules (42 CFR part 2). These rules prohibit you from using or disclosing this record, or testimony that describes the information contained in this record, in any civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings by any Federal, State, or local authority, against the patient, unless authorized by the consent of the patient, except as provided at 42 CFR 2.12(c)(5) or as authorized by a court in accordance with 42 CFR 2.64 or 2.65. In addition, the Federal rules prohibit you from making any other use or disclosure of this record unless at least one of the following applies:

        (i) Further use or disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed in this record or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2.

        (ii) You are a covered entity or business associate and have received the record for treatment, payment, or health care operations, or

        (iii) You have received the record from a covered entity or business associate as permitted by 45 CFR part 164, subparts A and E.

        A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient to meet the required elements of written consent to further use or redisclose the record (see 42 CFR 2.31).

        (2)  “42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of these records.”

        (b) Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by a copy of the consent or a clear explanation of the scope of the consent provided.

> [89 FR 12626, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 2.33   Uses and disclosures permitted with written consent.

#### § § 2.33

        (a) If a patient consents to a use or disclosure of their records consistent with § 2.31, the following uses and disclosures are permitted, as applicable:

        (1) A part 2 program may use and disclose those records in accordance with that consent to any person or category of persons identified or generally designated in the consent, except that disclosures to central registries and in connection with criminal justice referrals must meet the requirements of §§ 2.34 and 2.35, respectively.

        (2) When the consent provided is a single consent for all future uses and disclosures for treatment, payment, and health care operations, a part 2 program, covered entity, or business associate may use and disclose those records for treatment, payment, and health care operations as permitted by the HIPAA regulations, until such time as the patient revokes such consent in writing.

        (b) If a patient consents to a use or disclosure of their records consistent with § 2.31, the recipient may further disclose such records as provided in subpart E of this part, and as follows:

        (1) When disclosed for treatment, payment, and health care operations activities to a covered entity or business associate, such recipient may further disclose those records in accordance with the HIPAA regulations, except for uses and disclosures for civil, criminal, administrative, and legislative proceedings against the patient.

        (2) When disclosed with consent given once for all future treatment, payment, and health care operations activities to a part 2 program that is not a covered entity or business associate, the recipient may further disclose those records consistent with the consent.

        (3) When disclosed for payment or health care operations activities to a lawful holder that is not a covered entity or business associate, the recipient may further disclose those records as may be necessary for its contractors, subcontractors, or legal representatives to carry out the payment or health care operations specified in the consent on behalf of such lawful holders.

        (c) Lawful holders, other than covered entities and business associates, who wish to redisclose patient identifying information pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section must have in place a written contract or comparable legal instrument with the contractor or voluntary legal representative, which provides that the contractor, subcontractor, or voluntary legal representative is fully bound by the provisions of this part upon receipt of the patient identifying information. In making any such redisclosures, the lawful holder must furnish such recipients with the notice required under § 2.32; require such recipients to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized uses and disclosures; and require such recipients to report any unauthorized uses, disclosures, or breaches of patient identifying information to the lawful holder. The lawful holder may only redisclose information to the contractor or subcontractor or voluntary legal representative that is necessary for the contractor, subcontractor, or voluntary legal representative to perform its duties under the contract or comparable legal instrument. Contracts may not permit a contractor, subcontractor, or voluntary legal representative to redisclose information to a third party unless that third party is a contract agent of the contractor or subcontractor, helping them provide services described in the contract, and only as long as the agent only further discloses the information back to the contractor or lawful holder from which the information originated.

        (ii) The consent may authorize a disclosure to any withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program established within 200 miles of the program, but does not need to individually name all programs.

        (b)  A central registry and any withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program to which information is disclosed to prevent multiple enrollments may not use or redisclose patient identifying information for any purpose other than the prevention of multiple enrollments or to ensure appropriate coordinated care with a treating provider that is not a part 2 program unless authorized by a court order under subpart E of this part.

        (c)  When a member program asks a central registry if an identified patient is enrolled in another member program and the registry determines that the patient is so enrolled, the registry may disclose:

        (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the member program(s) in which the patient is already enrolled to the inquiring member program; and

        (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the inquiring member program to the member program(s) in which the patient is already enrolled. The member programs may communicate as necessary to verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple enrollments.

        (d)  When, for the purpose of preventing multiple program enrollments or duplicative prescriptions, or to inform prescriber decision making regarding prescribing of opioid medication(s) or other prescribed substances, a provider with a treating provider relationship that is not a member program asks a central registry if an identified patient is enrolled in a member program, the registry may disclose:

        (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the member program(s) in which the patient is enrolled;

        (2) Type and dosage of any medication for substance use disorder being administered or prescribed to the patient by the member program(s); and

        (b)  The written consent must state the period during which it remains in effect. This period must be reasonable, taking into account:

        (1) The anticipated length of the treatment;

        (2) The type of criminal proceeding involved, the need for the information in connection with the final disposition of that proceeding, and when the final disposition will occur; and

        (3) Such other factors as the part 2 program, the patient, and the person(s) within the criminal justice system who will receive the disclosure consider pertinent.

        (c)  The written consent must state that it is revocable upon the passage of a specified amount of time or the occurrence of a specified, ascertainable event. The time or occurrence upon which consent becomes revocable may be no later than the final disposition of the conditional release or other action in connection with which consent was given.

        (d)  Any persons within the criminal justice system who receive patient information under this section may use and redisclose it only to carry out official duties with regard to the patient's conditional release or other action in connection with which the consent was given.

      Subpart E—Court Orders Authorizing Use and Disclosure

        § 2.61   Legal effect of order.

#### § § 2.61

        (a)  An order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under this subpart is a unique kind of court order. Its only purpose is to authorize a use or disclosure of patient information which would otherwise be prohibited by 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2 and the regulations in this part. Such an order does not compel use or disclosure. A subpoena or a similar legal mandate must be issued to compel use or disclosure. This mandate may be entered at the same time as and accompany an authorizing court order entered under the regulations in this part.

        (b)  (1) A person holding records subject to the regulations in this part receives a subpoena for those records. The person may not use or disclose the records in response to the subpoena unless a court of competent jurisdiction enters an authorizing order under the regulations in this part.

        (2) An authorizing court order is entered under the regulations in this part, but the person holding the records does not want to make the use or disclosure. If there is no subpoena or other compulsory process or a subpoena for the records has expired or been quashed, that person may refuse to make the use or disclosure. Upon the entry of a valid subpoena or other compulsory process the person holding the records must use or disclose, unless there is a valid legal defense to the process other than the confidentiality restrictions of the regulations in this part.

> [89 FR 12629, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 2.62   Order not applicable to records disclosed without consent to researchers, auditors, and evaluators.

#### § § 2.62

        A court order under the regulations in this part may not authorize persons who meet the criteria specified in §§ 2.52(a)(1)(i) through (iii) and 2.53, who have received patient identifying information without consent for the purpose of conducting research, audit, or evaluation, to disclose that information or use it to conduct any criminal investigation or prosecution of a patient. However, a court order under § 2.66 may authorize use and disclosure of records to investigate or prosecute such persons who are holding the records.

        § 2.63   Confidential communications.

#### § § 2.63

        (a) A court order under the regulations in this part may authorize disclosure of confidential communications made by a patient to a part 2 program in the course of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment only if:

        (1) The disclosure is necessary to protect against an existing threat to life or of serious bodily injury, including circumstances which constitute suspected child abuse and neglect and verbal threats against third parties;

        (2) The disclosure is necessary in connection with investigation or prosecution of an extremely serious crime, such as one which directly threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury, including homicide, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, or child abuse and neglect; or

        (3) The disclosure is in connection with a civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceeding in which the patient offers testimony or other evidence pertaining to the content of the confidential communications.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 2.64   Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing uses and disclosures for noncriminal purposes.

#### § § 2.64

        (a)  An order authorizing the use or disclosure of patient records or testimony relaying the information contained in the records for purposes other than criminal investigation or prosecution may be applied for by any person having a legally recognized interest in the use or disclosure which is sought in the course of a civil, administrative, or legislative proceeding. The application may be filed separately or as part of a pending civil action in which the applicant asserts that the patient records or testimony relaying the information contained in the records are needed to provide evidence. An application must use a fictitious name, such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise disclose any patient identifying information unless the patient is the applicant or has given written consent (meeting the requirements of the regulations in this part) to disclosure or the court has ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny.

        (b)  A court order under this section is only valid when the patient and the person holding the records from whom disclosure is sought have received:

        (1) Adequate notice in a manner which does not disclose patient identifying information to other persons; and

        (2) An opportunity to file a written response to the application, or to appear in person, for the limited purpose of providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order as described in

        (c)  Any oral argument, review of evidence, or hearing on the application must be held in the judge's chambers or in some manner which ensures that patient identifying information is not disclosed to anyone other than a party to the proceeding, the patient, or the person holding the record, unless the patient requests an open hearing in a manner which meets the written consent requirements of the regulations in this part. The proceeding may include an examination by the judge of the patient records referred to in the application.

        (d)  An order under this section may be entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make this determination the court must find that:

        (1) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective; and

        (2) The public interest and need for the use or disclosure outweigh the potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship and the treatment services.

        (e)  An order authorizing a use or disclosure must:

        (1) Limit use or disclosure to only those parts of the patient's record, or testimony relaying those parts of the patient's record, which are essential to fulfill the objective of the order;

        (2) Limit use or disclosure to those persons whose need for information is the basis for the order; and

        (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit use or disclosure for the protection of the patient, the physician-patient relationship and the treatment services; for example, sealing from public scrutiny the record of any proceeding for which use or disclosure of a patient's record, or testimony relaying the contents of the record, has been ordered.

        § 2.65   Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing use and disclosure of records to criminally investigate or prosecute patients.

#### § § 2.65

        (a)  An order authorizing the use or disclosure of patient records, or testimony relaying the information contained in those records, to investigate or prosecute a patient in connection with a criminal proceeding may be applied for by the person holding the records or by any law enforcement or prosecutorial official who is responsible for conducting investigative or prosecutorial activities with respect to the enforcement of criminal laws, including administrative and legislative criminal proceedings. The application may be filed separately, as part of an application for a subpoena or other compulsory process, or in a pending criminal action. An application must use a fictitious name such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise use or disclose patient identifying information unless the court has ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny.

        (b)  Unless an order under § 2.66 is sought in addition to an order under this section, an order under this section is valid only when the person holding the records has received:

        (1) Adequate notice (in a manner which will not disclose patient identifying information to other persons) of an application by a law enforcement agency or official;

        (2) An opportunity to appear and be heard for the limited purpose of providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order as described in § 2.65(d); and

        (3) An opportunity to be represented by counsel independent of counsel for an applicant who is a law enforcement agency or official.

        (c)  Any oral argument, review of evidence, or hearing on the application shall be held in the judge's chambers or in some other manner which ensures that patient identifying information is not disclosed to anyone other than a party to the proceedings, the patient, or the person holding the records. The proceeding may include an examination by the judge of the patient records referred to in the application.

        (d)  A court may authorize the use and disclosure of patient records, or testimony relaying the information contained in those records, for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation or prosecution of a patient only if the court finds that all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) The crime involved is extremely serious, such as one which causes or directly threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury including homicide, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and child abuse and neglect.

        (2) There is a reasonable likelihood that the records or testimony will disclose information of substantial value in the investigation or prosecution.

        (3) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective.

        (4) The potential injury to the patient, to the physician-patient relationship and to the ability of the part 2 program to provide services to other patients is outweighed by the public interest and the need for the disclosure.

        (5) If the applicant is a law enforcement agency or official, that:

        (i) The person holding the records has been afforded the opportunity to be represented by independent counsel; and

        (ii) Any person holding the records which is an entity within federal, state, or local government has in fact been represented by counsel independent of the applicant.

        (e)  Any order authorizing a use or disclosure of patient records subject to this part, or testimony relaying the information contained in those records, under this section must:

        (1) Limit use and disclosure to those parts of the patient's record, or testimony relaying the information contained in those records, which are essential to fulfill the objective of the order;

        (2) Limit disclosure to those law enforcement and prosecutorial officials who are responsible for, or are conducting, the investigation or prosecution, and limit their use of the records or testimony to investigation and prosecution of the extremely serious crime or suspected crime specified in the application; and

        (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit use and disclosure to the fulfillment of only that public interest and need found by the court.

        § 2.66   Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing use and disclosure of records to investigate or prosecute a part 2 program or the person holding the records.

#### § § 2.66

        (a)  (1) An order authorizing the use or disclosure of patient records subject to this part to investigate or prosecute a part 2 program or the person holding the records (or employees or agents of that part 2 program or person holding the records) in connection with a criminal or administrative matter may be applied for by any investigative agency having jurisdiction over the program's or person's activities.

        (2) The application may be filed separately or as part of a pending civil or criminal action against a part 2 program or the person holding the records (or agents or employees of the part 2 program or person holding the records) in which the applicant asserts that the patient records are needed to provide material evidence. The application must use a fictitious name, such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise disclose any patient identifying information unless the court has ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny or the patient has provided written consent (meeting the requirements of § 2.31) to that disclosure.

        (3) Upon discovering in good faith that it received records under this part in the course of investigating or prosecuting a part 2 program or the person holding the records (or employees or agents of that part 2 program or person holding the records), an investigative agency must do the following:

        (i) Secure the records in accordance with § 2.16; and

        (ii) Immediately cease using and disclosing the records until the investigative agency obtains a court order consistent with paragraph (c) of this section authorizing the use and disclosure of the records and any records later obtained. The application for the court order must occur within a reasonable period of time, but not more than 120 days after discovering it received records under this part; or

        (iii) If the agency does not seek a court order in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the agency must either return the records to the part 2 program or person holding the records, if it is legally permissible to do so, within a reasonable period of time, but not more than 120 days after discovering it received records under this part; or

        (iv) If the agency does not seek a court order or return the records, the agency must destroy the records in a manner that renders the patient identifying information non-retrievable, within a reasonable period of time, but not more than 120 days after discovering it received records under this part.

        (v) If the agency's application for a court order is rejected by the court and no longer subject to appeal, the agency must return the records to the part 2 program or person holding the records, if it is legally permissible to do so, or destroy the records immediately after notice from the court.

        (b)  An application under this section may, in the discretion of the court, be granted without notice. Although no express notice is required to the part 2 program, to the person holding the records, or to any patient whose records are to be disclosed, upon implementation of an order so granted any of those persons must be afforded an opportunity to seek revocation or amendment of that order, limited to the presentation of evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If a court finds that individualized contact is impractical under the circumstances, patients may be informed of the opportunity through a substitute form of notice that the court determines is reasonably calculated to reach the patients, such as conspicuous notice in major print or broadcast media in geographic areas where the affected patients likely reside.

        (c)  An order under this section must be entered in accordance with, and comply with the requirements of § 2.64(e). In addition, an order under this section may be entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make such good cause determination, the court must find that:

        (1) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available, would not be effective, or would yield incomplete information;

        (2) The public interest and need for the use or disclosure outweigh the potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship, and the treatment services; and

        (3) For an application being submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the investigative agency has satisfied the conditions at § 2.3(b). Information from records obtained in violation of this part, including § 2.12(d), cannot be used in an application for a court order to obtain such records.

        (d)  (1) An order entered under this section must require the deletion or removal of patient identifying information from any documents or oral testimony made available to the public.

        (2) No information obtained under this section may be used or disclosed to conduct any investigation or prosecution of a patient in connection with a criminal matter, or be used or disclosed as the basis for an application for an order under § 2.65.

        § 2.67   Orders authorizing the use of undercover agents and informants to investigate employees or agents of a part 2 program in connection with a criminal matter.

#### § § 2.67

        (a)  A court order authorizing the placement of an undercover agent or informant in a part 2 program as an employee or patient may be applied for by any investigative agency which has reason to believe that employees or agents of the part 2 program are engaged in criminal misconduct.

        (b)  The part 2 program director must be given adequate notice of the application and an opportunity to appear and be heard (for the limited purpose of providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order in accordance with § 2.67(c)), unless the application asserts that:

        (1) The part 2 program director is involved in the suspected criminal activities to be investigated by the undercover agent or informant; or

        (2) The part 2 program director will intentionally or unintentionally disclose the proposed placement of an undercover agent or informant to the employees or agents of the program who are suspected of criminal activities.

        (c)  An order under this section may be entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make such good cause determination, the court must find all of the following:

        (1) There is reason to believe that an employee or agent of the part 2 program is engaged in criminal activity;

        (2) Other ways of obtaining evidence of the suspected criminal activity are not available, would not be effective, or would yield incomplete evidence;

        (3) The public interest and need for the placement of an undercover agent or informant in the part 2 program outweigh the potential injury to patients of the part 2 program, physician-patient relationships, and the treatment services; and

        (4) For an application submitted after the placement of an undercover agent or informant has already occurred, that the investigative agency has satisfied the conditions at § 2.3(b) and only discovered that a court order was necessary after such placement occurred. Information from records obtained in violation of this part, including § 2.12(d), cannot be used in an application for a court order to obtain such records.

        (d)  An order authorizing the placement of an undercover agent or informant in a part 2 program must:

        (1) Specifically authorize the placement of an undercover agent or an informant;

        (2) Limit the total period of the placement to twelve months, starting on the date that the undercover agent or informant is placed on site within the program. The placement of an undercover agent or informant must end after 12 months, unless a new court order is issued to extend the period of placement;

        (3) Prohibit the undercover agent or informant from using or disclosing any patient identifying information obtained from the placement except as necessary to investigate or prosecute employees or agents of the part 2 program in connection with the suspected criminal activity; and

        (4) Include any other measures which are appropriate to limit any potential disruption of the part 2 program by the placement and any potential for a real or apparent breach of patient confidentiality; for example, sealing from public scrutiny the record of any proceeding for which disclosure of a patient's record has been ordered.

        (e)  No information obtained by an undercover agent or informant placed in a part 2 program under this section may be used or disclosed to investigate or prosecute any patient in connection with a criminal matter or as the basis for an application for an order under § 2.65.

    PART 2a—PROTECTION OF IDENTITY—RESEARCH SUBJECTS

### Part 2a

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 3(a), Pub. L. 91-513 as amended by sec. 122(b), Pub. L. 93-282; 84 Stat. 1241 (42 U.S.C. 242a(a)), as amended by 88 Stat. 132.

**Source:** Source: 44 FR 20384, Apr. 4, 1979, unless otherwise noted.

      § 2a.1   Applicability.

#### § § 2a.1

      (a) Section 303(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242a(a)) provides that “[t]he Secretary [of Health and Human Services] may authorize persons engaged in research on mental health, including research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs, to protect the privacy of individuals who are the subject of such research by withholding from all persons not connected with the conduct of such research the names or other identifying characteristics of such individuals. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such individuals may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify such individuals.” The regulations in this part establish procedures under which any person engaged in research on mental health including research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs (whether or not the research is federally funded) may, subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, apply for such an authorization of confidentiality.

      (b) These regulations do not apply to:

      (1) Authorizations of confidentiality for research requiring an Investigational New Drug exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) or to approved new drugs, such as methadone, requiring continuation of long-term studies, records, and reports. Attention is called to 21 CFR 291.505(g) relating to authorizations of confidentiality for patient records maintained by methadone treatment programs.

      (2) Authorizations of confidentiality for research which are related to law enforcement activities or otherwise within the purview of the Attorney General's authority to issue authorizations of confidentiality pursuant to section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 872(c)) and 21 CFR 1316.21.

      (c) The Secretary's regulations on confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records (42 CFR part 2) and the regulations of this part may, in some instances, concurrently cover the same transaction. As explained in 42 CFR 2.24 and 2.24-1, 42 CFR part 2 restricts voluntary disclosures of information from applicable patient records while a Confidentiality Certificate issued pursuant to the regulations of this part protects a person engaged in applicable research from being compelled to disclose identifying characteristics of individuals who are the subject of such research.

      § 2a.2   Definitions.

#### § § 2a.2

      (a)  means the _Secretary_ of Health and Human Services and any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.

      (b)  means any individual, corporation, government, or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, partnership, association, or other legal entity.

      (c)  means systematic study directed toward new or fuller knowledge and understanding of the subject studied. The term includes, but is not limited to, behavioral science studies, surveys, evaluations, and clinical investigations.

      (d)  has the meaning given that term by section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, _Drug_, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).

      (e)  means a drug which is included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811-812).

      (f)  refers to the direct application of a drug to the body of a human research subject, whether such application be by injection, inhalation, ingestion, or any other means, by (1) a qualified person engaged in research (or, in his or her presence, by his or her authorized agent), or (2) a research subject in accordance with instructions of a qualified person engaged in research, whether or not in the presence of a qualified person engaged in research.

      (g)  refers to the name, address, any identifying number, fingerprints, voiceprints, photographs or any other item or combination of data about a research subject which could reasonably lead directly or indirectly by reference to other information to identification of that research subject.

      (h)  means, in addition to alcohol, any drug which has as its principal action an effect on thought, mood, or behavior.

      § 2a.3   Application; coordination.

#### § § 2a.3

      (a) Any person engaged in (or who intends to engage in) the research to which this part applies, who desires authorization to withhold the names and other identifying characteristics of individuals who are the subject of such research from any person or authority not connected with the conduct of such research may apply to the Office of the Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Office of the Director, National Institute of Mental Health, or the Office of the Director, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 for an authorization of confidentiality.

Each reportable obligation or discrete set of obligations that the PSO has with this contracting provider should be listed only once; noting the specific aspects of the obligation(s) that reflect contractual or financial relationships, involve access to information that is not available to other providers, or affect the independence of PSO operations, management, or control.

        (B)  The second required part of the substantive information must provide a brief explanatory narrative succinctly describing: The policies and procedures that the PSO has in place to ensure adherence to objectivity and professionally recognized analytic standards in the assessments it undertakes; and any other policies or procedures, or agreements with this provider, that the PSO has in place to ensure that it can fairly and accurately perform patient safety activities.

        (iii)  The Secretary must receive a disclosure statement within 45 days of the date on which a PSO enters a contract with a provider if the circumstances described in any of the paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section are met on the date the contract is entered. During the contract period, if these circumstances subsequently arise, the Secretary must receive a disclosure statement from the PSO within 45 days of the date that any disclosure requirement in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section first applies.

        § 3.104   Secretarial actions.

#### § § 3.104

        (a)  (1) In response to an initial or continued certification submission by an entity, pursuant to the requirements of § 3.102 of this subpart, the Secretary may—

        (i) Accept the certification submission and list the entity as a PSO, or maintain the listing of a PSO, if the Secretary determines that the entity meets the applicable requirements of the Patient Safety Act and this subpart;

        (ii) Deny acceptance of a certification submission and, in the case of a currently listed PSO, remove the entity from the list if the entity does not meet the applicable requirements of the Patient Safety Act and this subpart; or

        (iii) Condition the listing of an entity or the continued listing of a PSO, following a determination made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or a determination after review of the pertinent history of an entity that has been delisted or refused listing and its officials and senior managers.

        (2)  In making a determination regarding listing, the Secretary will consider the certification submission; any prior actions by the Secretary regarding the entity or PSO including delisting; any history of or current non-compliance by the entity or the PSO or its officials or senior managers with statutory or regulatory requirements or requests from the Secretary; the relationships of the entity or PSO with providers; and any findings made by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (3)  The Secretary will notify in writing each entity of action taken on its certification submission for initial or continued listing. The Secretary will provide reasons when an entity's certification is conditionally accepted and the entity is conditionally listed, when an entity's certification is not accepted and the entity is not listed, or when acceptance of its certification is revoked and the entity is delisted.

        (b)  After the date on which the Secretary, under § 3.102(d)(1) of this subpart, must receive notification regarding compliance of a PSO with the minimum contract requirement—

        (1) If the PSO has met the minimum contract requirement, the Secretary will acknowledge in writing receipt of the notification and add information to the list established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section stating that the PSO has certified that it has met the requirement.

        (2) If the PSO states that it has not yet met the minimum contract requirement by the date specified in § 3.102(d)(1), or if notice is not received by that date, the Secretary will issue to the PSO a notice of a preliminary finding of deficiency as specified in § 3.108(a)(2) and establish a period for correction that extends until midnight of the last day of the PSO's applicable 24-month period of assessment. Thereafter, if the requirement has not been met, the Secretary will provide the PSO a written notice of proposed revocation and delisting in accordance with § 3.108(a)(3).

        (c)  The Secretary will review and make findings regarding each disclosure statement submitted by a PSO, pursuant to § 3.102(d)(2), regarding its relationships with contracting provider(s), determine whether such findings warrant action regarding the listing of the PSO in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and make the findings public.

        (1)  In reviewing disclosure statements, submitted pursuant to § 3.102(d)(2) of this subpart, the Secretary will consider the disclosed relationship(s) between the PSO and the contracting provider and the statements and material submitted by the PSO describing the policies and procedures that the PSO has in place to determine whether the PSO can fairly and accurately perform the required patient safety activities.

        (2)  Based on the Secretary's review and findings, he may choose to take any of the following actions:

        (i) For an entity seeking an initial or continued listing, the Secretary may list or continue the listing of an entity without conditions, list the entity subject to conditions, or deny the entity's certification for initial or continued listing; or

        (ii) For a listed PSO, the Secretary may determine that the entity will remain listed without conditions, continue the entity's listing subject to conditions, or remove the entity from the list of PSOs.

        (3)  (i) Subject to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Secretary will make disclosure statements available to the public along with related findings that are made available in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (ii) The Secretary may withhold information that is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, e.g., trade secrets or confidential commercial information that are subject to the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 1905.

        (d)  The Secretary will compile and maintain a publicly available list of entities whose certifications as PSOs have been accepted. The list will include contact information for each entity, a copy of all certification forms and disclosure statements submitted by each entity in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the effective date of the PSO's listing, and information on whether a PSO has certified that it has met the two contract requirement. The list also will include a copy of the Secretary's findings regarding each disclosure statement submitted by an entity, information describing any related conditions that have been placed by the Secretary on the listing of an entity as a PSO, and other information that this Subpart states may be made public. AHRQ may maintain a PSO website (or a comparable future form of public notice) and may post the list on this website.

        (e)  (1) The three-year period of listing of a PSO will automatically expire at midnight of the last day of this period, unless the listing had been revoked or relinquished earlier in accordance with § 3.108 of this subpart, or if, prior to this automatic expiration, the PSO seeks a new three-year listing, in accordance with § 3.102, and the Secretary accepts the PSO's certification for a new three-year listing, in accordance with § 3.104(a).

        (2) The Secretary plans to send a written notice of imminent expiration to a PSO at least 60 calendar days prior to the date on which its three-year period of listing expires if the Secretary has not yet received a certification for continued listing. The Secretary plans to indicate, on the AHRQ PSO website, the PSOs from whom certifications for continued listing have not been timely received.

        (f)  Unless otherwise stated, the effective date of each action by the Secretary pursuant to this subpart will be specified in the written notice of such action that is sent to the entity. When the Secretary sends a notice that addresses acceptance or revocation of an entity's certifications or voluntary relinquishment by an entity of its status as a PSO, the notice will specify the effective date and time of listing or delisting.

        § 3.106   Security requirements.

#### § § 3.106

        (a)  A PSO must secure patient safety work product in conformance with the security requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. These requirements must be met at all times and at any location at which the PSO, its workforce members, or its contractors receive, access, or handle patient safety work product. Handling patient safety work product includes its processing, development, use, maintenance, storage, removal, disclosure, transmission and destruction.

        (b)  A PSO must have written policies and procedures that address each of the considerations specified in this subsection. In addressing the framework that follows, the PSO may develop appropriate and scalable security standards, policies, and procedures that are suitable for the size and complexity of its organization.

        (1)  A PSO must address:

        (i) Maintenance and effective implementation of written policies and procedures that conform to the requirements of this section to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the patient safety work product that is received, accessed, or handled; and to monitor and improve the effectiveness of such policies and procedures, and

        (ii) Training of the PSO workforce and PSO contractors who receive, access, or handle patient safety work product regarding the requirements of the Patient Safety Act, this Part, and the PSO's policies and procedures regarding the confidentiality and security of patient safety work product.

        (2)  A PSO must address:

        (i) Maintenance of the security of patient safety work product, whether in electronic or other media, through either physical separation from non-patient safety work product, or if co-located with non-patient safety work product, by making patient safety work product distinguishable so that the appropriate form and level of security can be applied and maintained;

        (ii) Protection of the media, whether in electronic, paper, or other media or format, that contain patient safety work product, limiting access to authorized users, and sanitizing and destroying such media before their disposal or release for reuse; and

        (iii) Physical and environmental protection, to control and limit physical and virtual access to places and equipment where patient safety work product is received, accessed, or handled.

        (3)  A PSO must address:

        (i) Identification of those authorized to receive, access, or handle patient safety work product and an audit capacity to detect unlawful, unauthorized, or inappropriate receipt, access, or handling of patient safety work product, and

        (ii) Methods to prevent unauthorized receipt, access, or handling of patient safety work product.

        (4)  A PSO must address:

        (i) Periodic assessments of security risks and controls to establish if its controls are effective, to correct any deficiency identified, and to reduce or eliminate any vulnerabilities.

        (ii) System and communications protection, to monitor, control, and protect PSO receipt, access, or handling of patient safety work product with particular attention to the transmission of patient safety work product to and from providers, other PSOs, contractors or any other responsible persons.

        § 3.108   Correction of deficiencies, revocation, and voluntary relinquishment.

#### § § 3.108

        (a) —(1)  The Secretary may revoke his acceptance of an entity's certification (“revocation”) and delist the entity as a PSO if he determines—

        (i) The PSO is not fulfilling the certifications made to the Secretary as required by § 3.102;

        (ii) The PSO has not met the two contract requirement, as required by § 3.102(d)(1);

        (iii) Based on a PSO's disclosures made pursuant to § 3.102(d)(2) , that the entity cannot fairly and accurately perform the patient safety activities of a PSO with a public finding to that effect; or

        (iv) The PSO is not in compliance with any other provision of the Patient Safety Act or this part.

        (2)  (i) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, if the Secretary determines that a PSO is not in compliance with its obligations under the Patient Safety Act or this subpart, the Secretary must send a PSO written notice of the preliminary finding of deficiency. The notice must state the actions or inactions that encompass the deficiency finding, outline the evidence that the deficiency exists, specify the possible and/or required corrective actions that must be taken, and establish a date by which the deficiency must be corrected. The Secretary may specify in the notice the form of documentation required to demonstrate that the deficiency has been corrected.

        (ii) The notice of a preliminary finding of deficiency is presumed received five days after it is sent, absent evidence of the actual receipt date. If a PSO does not submit evidence to the Secretary within 14 calendar days of actual or constructive receipt of such notice, whichever is longer, which demonstrates that the preliminary finding is factually incorrect, the preliminary finding will be the basis for a finding of deficiency.

        (3)  (i) Unless the Secretary specifies another date, the Secretary must receive documentation to demonstrate that the PSO has corrected any deficiency cited in the preliminary finding of deficiency no later than five calendar days following the last day of the correction period that is specified by the Secretary in such notice.

        (ii) In making a determination regarding the correction of any deficiency, the Secretary will consider the documentation submitted by the PSO, any assessments under § 3.110, recommendations of program staff, and any other information available regarding the PSO that the Secretary deems appropriate and relevant to the PSO's implementation of the terms of its certification.

        (iii) After completing his review, the Secretary may make one of the following determinations:

        (A) The action(s) taken by the PSO have corrected any deficiency, in which case the Secretary will withdraw the notice of deficiency and so notify the PSO;

        (B) The PSO has acted in good faith to correct the deficiency, but the Secretary finds an additional period of time is necessary to achieve full compliance and/or the required corrective action specified in the notice of a preliminary finding of deficiency needs to be modified in light of the experience of the PSO in attempting to implement the corrective action, in which case the Secretary will extend the period for correction and/or modify the specific corrective action required; or

        (C) The PSO has not completed the corrective action because it has not acted with reasonable diligence or speed to ensure that the corrective action was completed within the allotted time, in which case the Secretary will issue to the PSO a notice of proposed revocation and delisting.

        (iv) When the Secretary issues a written notice of proposed revocation and delisting, the notice will specify the deficiencies that have not been timely corrected and will detail the manner in which the PSO may exercise its opportunity to be heard in writing to respond to the deficiencies specified in the notice.

        (4)  The Secretary will afford a PSO an opportunity to be heard in writing, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, to provide a substantive response to the deficiency finding(s) set forth in the notice of proposed revocation and delisting.

        (i) The notice of proposed revocation and delisting is presumed received five days after it is sent, absent evidence of actual receipt. The Secretary will provide a PSO with a period of time, beginning with the date of receipt of the notice of proposed revocation and delisting of which there is evidence, or the presumed date of receipt if there is no evidence of earlier receipt, and ending at midnight 30 calendar days thereafter, during which the PSO may submit a substantive response to the deficiency findings in writing.

        (ii) The Secretary will provide to the PSO any rules of procedure governing the form or transmission of the written response to the notice of proposed revocation and delisting. Such rules may also be posted on the AHRQ PSO Web site or published in the

        (iii) If a PSO does not submit a written response to the deficiency finding(s) within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice of proposed revocation and delisting, the notice of proposed revocation becomes final as a matter of law and the basis for Secretarial action under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (5)  The Secretary will review the entire administrative record pertaining to a notice of proposed revocation and delisting and any written materials submitted by the PSO under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The Secretary may affirm, reverse, or modify the notice of proposed revocation and delisting and will make a determination with respect to the continued listing of the PSO.

        (b) —(1)  When the Secretary concludes, in accordance with a decision made under paragraphs (a)(5), (e)(3)(iii) or (e)(3)(iv)(C) of this section, that revocation of the acceptance of a PSO's certification is warranted for its failure to comply with requirements of the Patient Safety Act or of this Part, the Secretary will establish the effective time and date for such prompt revocation and removal of the entity from the list of PSOs, so notify the PSO in writing, and provide the relevant public notice required by § 3.108(d) of this subpart.

        (2)  (i) Upon being notified of the Secretary's action pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the former PSO will take all reasonable actions to notify each provider, whose patient safety work product it collected or analyzed, of the Secretary's action(s) and the following statutory information: Confidentiality and privilege protections that applied to patient safety work product while the former PSO was listed continue to apply after the entity is removed from listing. Data submitted by providers to the former PSO for 30 calendar days following the date and time on which the entity was removed from the list of PSOs pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section will have the same status as data submitted while the entity was still listed.

        (ii) Within 15 days of being notified of the Secretary's action pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the former PSO shall submit to the Secretary confirmation that it has taken the actions in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

        (3)  Within 90 days following the effective date of revocation and delisting pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the former PSO will take one or more of the following measures in regard to patient safety work product and data described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section:

        (i) Transfer such patient safety work product or data, with the approval of the source from which it was received, to a PSO that has agreed to receive such patient safety work product or data;

        (ii) Return such work product or data to the source from which it was submitted; or

        (iii) If returning such patient safety work product or data to its source is not practicable, destroy such patient safety work product or data.

        (c) —(1)  A PSO will be considered to have voluntarily relinquished its status as a PSO if the Secretary accepts a notification from a PSO that it wishes to relinquish voluntarily its listing as a PSO.

        (2)  A PSO's notification of voluntary relinquishment to the Secretary must include the following:

        (i) An attestation that all reasonable efforts have been made, or will have been made by a PSO within 15 calendar days of this statement, to notify the sources from which it received patient safety work product of the PSO's intention to cease PSO operations and activities, to relinquish voluntarily its status as a PSO, to request that these other entities cease reporting or submitting any further information to the PSO as soon as possible, and inform them that any information reported after the effective date and time of delisting that the Secretary sets pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be protected as patient safety work product under the Patient Safety Act.

        (ii) An attestation that the entity has established a plan, or within 15 calendar days of this statement, will have made all reasonable efforts to establish a plan, in consultation with the sources from which it received patient safety work product, that provides for the disposition of the patient safety work product held by the PSO consistent with, to the extent practicable, the statutory options for disposition of patient safety work product as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and

        (iii) Appropriate contact information for further communications from the Secretary.

        (3)  (i) After a PSO provides the notification required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary will respond in writing to the entity indicating whether the proposed voluntary relinquishment of its PSO status is accepted. If the voluntary relinquishment is accepted, the Secretary's response will indicate an effective date and time for the entity's removal from the list of PSOs and will provide public notice of the voluntary relinquishment and the effective date and time of the delisting, in accordance with § 3.108(d) of this subpart.

        (ii) If the Secretary receives a notification of voluntary relinquishment during or immediately after revocation proceedings for cause under paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary, as a matter of discretion, may accept voluntary relinquishment in accordance with the preceding paragraph or decide not to accept the entity's proposed voluntary relinquishment and proceed with the revocation for cause and delisting pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (4)  (i) A decision by the Secretary to accept a request by a PSO to relinquish voluntarily its status as a PSO pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not constitute a determination of a deficiency in PSO compliance with the Patient Safety Act or with this Subpart.

        (ii) The procedures and requirements of § 3.108(a) of this subpart regarding deficiencies including the opportunity to correct deficiencies and to be heard in writing, and the procedures and requirements of § 3.108(b) are not applicable to determinations of the Secretary made pursuant to this subsection.

        (d)  If the Secretary removes an entity from the list of PSOs following revocation of acceptance of the entity's certification pursuant to § 3.108(b)(1), voluntary relinquishment pursuant to § 3.108(c)(3), or expiration of an entity's period of listing pursuant to § 3.104(e)(1), the Secretary will promptly publish in the  and on the AHRQ PSO website, or in a comparable future form of public notice, a notice of the actions taken and the effective dates.

        (e) —(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may use the expedited revocation process described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section if he determines—

        (i) The PSO is not in compliance with this part because it is or is about to become an entity described in § 3.102(a)(2).

        (ii) The parent organization of the PSO is an entity described in § 3.102(a)(2) and requires or induces health care providers to report patient safety work product to its component PSO; or

        (iii) The circumstances for revocation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exist, and the Secretary has determined that there would be serious adverse consequences if the PSO were to remain listed.

        (2) Applicable provisions. If the Secretary uses the expedited revocation process described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the procedures in paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section shall not apply and paragraph (a)(1) and paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section shall apply.

        (b) For the purpose of this section, the term “documents” includes information, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers and other data and documentary evidence. Nothing contained in this section may be interpreted to require the creation of a document, except that requested data stored in an electronic data storage system must be produced in a form accessible to the requesting party.

        (c) Requests for documents, requests for admissions, written interrogatories, depositions and any forms of discovery, other than those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, are not authorized.

        (d) This section may not be construed to require the disclosure of interview reports or statements obtained by any party, or on behalf of any party, of persons who will not be called as witnesses by that party, or analyses and summaries prepared in conjunction with the investigation or litigation of the case, or any otherwise privileged documents.

        (e)(1) When a request for production of documents has been received, within 30 days the party receiving that request must either fully respond to the request, or state that the request is being objected to and the reasons for that objection. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part must be specified. Upon receiving any objections, the party seeking production may then, within 30 days or any other time frame set by the ALJ, file a motion for an order compelling discovery. The party receiving a request for production may also file a motion for protective order any time before the date the production is due.

#### § § 3.518

        (a) The parties must exchange witness lists, copies of prior written statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements that the party intends to offer in lieu of live testimony in accordance with § 3.538, not more than 60, and not less than 15, days before the scheduled hearing.

        (b)(1) If, at any time, a party objects to the proposed admission of evidence not exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the ALJ must determine whether the failure to comply with paragraph (a) of this section should result in the exclusion of that evidence.

        (2) Unless the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances justified the failure timely to exchange the information listed under paragraph (a) of this section, the ALJ must exclude from the party's case-in-chief—

        (i) The testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the witness list; and

        (ii) Any exhibit not provided to the opposing party as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (3) If the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances existed, the ALJ must then determine whether the admission of that evidence would cause substantial prejudice to the objecting party.

        (i) If the ALJ finds that there is no substantial prejudice, the evidence may be admitted.

        (ii) If the ALJ finds that there is substantial prejudice, the ALJ may exclude the evidence, or, if he or she does not exclude the evidence, must postpone the hearing for such time as is necessary for the objecting party to prepare and respond to the evidence, unless the objecting party waives postponement.

        (c) Unless the other party objects within a reasonable period of time before the hearing, documents exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section will be deemed to be authentic for the purpose of admissibility at the hearing.

#### § § 3.548

        (a) Any party may appeal the decision of the ALJ to the Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Board within 30 days of the date of service of the ALJ decision. The Board may extend the initial 30 day period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if a party files with the Board a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good cause.

        (b) If a party files a timely notice of appeal with the Board, the ALJ must forward the record of the proceeding to the Board.

        (c) A notice of appeal must be accompanied by a written brief specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons supporting the exceptions. Any party may file a brief in opposition to the exceptions, which may raise any relevant issue not addressed in the exceptions, within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and the accompanying brief. The Board may permit the parties to file reply briefs.

        (d) There is no right to appear personally before the Board or to appeal to the Board any interlocutory ruling by the ALJ.

        (e) The Board may not consider any issue not raised in the parties' briefs, nor any issue in the briefs that could have been raised before the ALJ but was not.

        (f) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing, the Board may remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.

        (g) The Board may decline to review the case, or may affirm, increase, reduce, reverse or remand any penalty determined by the ALJ.

        (h) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether the initial decision of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the decision is erroneous.

        (i) Within 60 days after the time for submission of briefs and reply briefs, if permitted, has expired, the Board must serve on each party to the appeal a copy of the Board's decision and a statement describing the right of any respondent who is penalized to seek judicial review.

        (j)(1) The Board's decision under paragraph (i) of this section, including a decision to decline review of the initial decision, becomes the final decision of the Secretary 60 days after the date of service of the Board's decision, except with respect to a decision to remand to the ALJ or if reconsideration is requested under this paragraph.

        (2) The Board will reconsider its decision only if it determines that the decision contains a clear error of fact or error of law. New evidence will not be a basis for reconsideration unless the party demonstrates that the evidence is newly discovered and was not previously available.

        (3) A party may file a motion for reconsideration with the Board before the date the decision becomes final under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a written brief specifying any alleged error of fact or law and, if the party is relying on additional evidence, explaining why the evidence was not previously available. Any party may file a brief in opposition within 15 days of receiving the motion for reconsideration and the accompanying brief unless this time limit is extended by the Board for good cause shown. Reply briefs are not permitted.

        (4) The Board must rule on the motion for reconsideration not later than 30 days from the date the opposition brief is due. If the Board denies the motion, the decision issued under paragraph (i) of this section becomes the final decision of the Secretary on the date of service of the ruling. If the Board grants the motion, the Board will issue a reconsidered decision, after such procedures as the Board determines necessary to address the effect of any error. The Board's decision on reconsideration becomes the final decision of the Secretary on the date of service of the decision, except with respect to a decision to remand to the ALJ.

        (5) If service of a ruling or decision issued under this section is by mail, the date of service will be deemed to be 5 days from the date of mailing.

        (k)(1) A respondent's petition for judicial review must be filed within 60 days of the date on which the decision of the Board becomes the final decision of the Secretary under paragraph (j) of this section.

        (2) In compliance with 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), a copy of any petition for judicial review filed in any U.S. Court of Appeals challenging the final decision of the Secretary must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the General Counsel of HHS. The petition copy must be a copy showing that it has been time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original was filed with the court.

        (3) If the General Counsel of HHS received two or more petitions within 10 days after the final decision of the Secretary, the General Counsel will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation of any petitions that were received within the 10 day period.

        § 3.550   Stay of the Secretary's decision.

#### § § 3.550

        (a) Pending judicial review, the respondent may file a request for stay of the effective date of any penalty with the ALJ. The request must be accompanied by a copy of the notice of appeal filed with the Federal court. The filing of the request automatically stays the effective date of the penalty until such time as the ALJ rules upon the request.

        (b) The ALJ may not grant a respondent's request for stay of any penalty unless the respondent posts a bond or provides other adequate security.

        (c) The ALJ must rule upon a respondent's request for stay within 10 days of receipt.

        § 3.552   Harmless error.

#### § § 3.552

        No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence, and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in any act done or omitted by the ALJ or by any of the parties is ground for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing an otherwise appropriate ruling or order or act, unless refusal to take such action appears to the ALJ or the Board inconsistent with substantial justice. The ALJ and the Board at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

      (2) A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would therefore be covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (3) A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the arrangement is within the scope of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

      (4) For the specific activities described in this paragraph (e)(4), when carried out by an entity (and its eligible personnel) that has been covered under paragraph (c) of this section, the Department has determined that coverage is provided under paragraph (d) of this section, without the need for specific application for an additional coverage determination under paragraph (d) of this section, if the activity or arrangement in question fits squarely within these descriptions; otherwise, the health center should seek a particularized determination of coverage.

      (i)  (A) School-Based Clinics: Health center staff provide primary and preventive health care services at a facility located in a school or on school grounds. The health center has a written affiliation agreement with the school.

      (B) School-Linked Clinics: Health center staff provide primary and preventive health care services, at a site not located on school grounds, to students of one or more schools. The health center has a written affiliation agreement with each school.

      (C) Health Fairs: On behalf of the health center, health center staff conduct or participate in an event to attract community members for purposes of performing health assessments. Such events may be held in the health center, outside on its grounds, or elsewhere in the community.

      (D) Immunization Campaigns: On behalf of the health center, health center staff conduct or participate in an event to immunize individuals against infectious illnesses. The event may be held at the health center, schools, or elsewhere in the community.

      (E) Migrant Camp Outreach: Health center staff travel to a migrant farmworker residence camp to conduct intake screening to determine those in need of clinic services (which may mean health care is provided at the time of such intake activity or during subsequent clinic staff visits to the camp).

      (F) Homeless Outreach: Health center staff travel to a shelter for homeless persons, or a street location where homeless persons congregate, to conduct intake screening to determine those in need of clinic services (which may mean health care is provided at the time of such intake activity or during subsequent clinic staff visits to that location).

      (ii)  Periodic hospital call or hospital emergency room coverage is required by the hospital as a condition for obtaining hospital admitting privileges. There must also be documentation for the particular health care provider that this coverage is a condition of employment at the health center.

      (iii)  As part of a health center's arrangement with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients, the health center's providers are required by their employment contract to provide periodic or occasional cross-coverage for patients of these providers.

      (iv)  A health center provider is providing or undertaking to provide covered services to a health center patient within the approved scope of project of the center, or to an individual who is not a patient of the health center under the conditions set forth in this rule, when the provider is then asked, called upon, or undertakes, at or near that location and as the result of a non-health center patient's emergency situation, to temporarily treat or assist in treating that non-health center patient. In addition to any other documentation required for the original services, the health center must have documentation (such as employee manual provisions, health center bylaws, or an employee contract) that the provision of individual emergency treatment, when the practitioner is already providing or undertaking to provide covered services, is a condition of employment at the health center.

        § 8.1   Scope.

#### § § 8.1

        (a)  This subpart and subparts B through D of this part establish the procedures by which the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) will determine whether an applicant seeking to become an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) is qualified under section 303(h) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 823(h)) to dispense Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) in the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), and establishes the Secretary's standards regarding the appropriate quantities of MOUD that may be provided for unsupervised use by individuals undergoing such treatment (21 U.S.C. 823(h)). Under this subpart and subparts B through D, an applicant seeking to become an OTP must first obtain from the Secretary or, by delegation, from the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, a certification that the applicant is qualified under the Secretary's standards and will comply with such standards. Eligibility for certification will depend upon the applicant obtaining accreditation from an Accreditation Body that has been approved by the Secretary. This subpart and subparts B through D also establish the procedures whereby an entity can apply to become an approved Accreditation Body, and the requirements and general standards for Accreditation Bodies to ensure that OTPs are consistently evaluated for compliance with the Secretary's standards for treatment of OUD with MOUD.

        (b)  Any provision of this part held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, or stayed pending further agency action, shall be construed so as to give it the maximum effect permitted by law, unless such holding shall be one of utter invalidity or unenforceability, in which event such provision shall be severable from this part and shall not affect the remainder thereof or the application of the provision to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances.

        § 8.4   Accreditation Body responsibilities.

#### § § 8.4

        (a)  (1) Accreditation Bodies shall conduct routine accreditation surveys for initial accreditation, and then at least every three years to allow for renewal of certification.

        (2) Accreditation Bodies must agree to conduct for-cause inspections upon the request of the Secretary.

        (3) Accreditation decisions shall be fully consistent with the policies and procedures submitted as part of the approved Accreditation Body application.

        (b)  (1) If an Accreditation Body receives or discovers information that suggests that an OTP is not meeting applicable accreditation or certification standards established or authorized under this part, or if a survey of the OTP by the Accreditation Body demonstrates that such standards are not being met, the Accreditation Body shall, within 60 days following discovery of the non-compliant condition(s) or applicable survey date:

        (i) Provide written notice to the OTP that identifies each area of non-compliance, categorizes each non-compliant condition as either “minor” or “significant” as determined by the Accrediting Body, and requires the OTP to take corrective action to address the area(s) of non-compliance within a schedule, not to exceed 180 days, that the Accrediting Body deems appropriate based on the severity of the non-compliant conditions; and

        (ii) Provide the Secretary with a copy of the written notice required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

        (2) Once an Accreditation Body provides an OTP with the notice described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, it shall verify the implementation of the corrective measures by the OTP within the specified schedule. Within 30 days following the last day of the specified schedule, the Accreditation Body shall provide written notice to the Secretary regarding whether the OTP has implemented the corrective measures.

        (3) OTPs that are meeting the requirements of § 8.12, but are only required to correct minor non-compliant conditions shall be granted a three-year accreditation, beginning from the end date of the current and expiring accreditation period. Minor non-compliant conditions, found at the time of the survey that are not resolved, as determined by the Accreditation Body, within the OTP's three-year accreditation period and that remain areas of non-compliance during the OTP's subsequent three-year accreditation renewal survey, shall automatically be categorized as “significant” non-compliant conditions for purposes of the renewal survey and must be corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

        (4) OTPs that are required to correct significant non-compliant conditions shall be granted a one-year accreditation, beginning from the end date of the current and expiring accreditation period. An OTP's accreditation must be revoked if it fails to correct significant non-compliant conditions within the schedule provided under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If an Accrediting Body verifies that an OTP has corrected the significant non-compliant conditions identified within the specified schedule, it shall extend the OTP's accreditation period by an additional two years.

        (5) In cases of severe non-compliance with the requirements of § 8.12 that pose immediate risks to patient health and safety, the Accreditation Body shall inform the OTP and Secretary within 48 hours and provide a detailed written report of the non-compliance within 5 business days. The Accreditation Body shall give the OTP 30 days from the date of the non-compliance report to correct the non-compliance issue(s). A follow-up survey shall be conducted by the Accreditation Body within 30 days of the expected correction date to ensure successful remediation. Should the OTP not rectify the non-compliance within the 30-day period, the Accreditation Body shall revoke the OTP's accreditation. The Secretary will then make a decision regarding the OTP's certification in accordance with the procedures under § 8.13.

        (c)  (1) Accreditation Bodies shall maintain, and make available as requested by the Secretary, records of their accreditation activities for at least 5 years from the creation of the record. Such records must contain sufficient detail to support each accreditation decision made by the Accreditation Body.

        (2) Accreditation Bodies shall establish procedures to protect confidential information collected or received in their role as Accreditation Bodies that are consistent with, and that are designed to ensure compliance with, all Federal and State laws, including 42 CFR part 2.

        (i) Information collected or received for the purpose of carrying out Accreditation Body responsibilities shall not be used for any other purpose or disclosed, other than to the Secretary or its duly designated representatives, unless otherwise required by law or with the consent of the OTP.

        (ii) Nonpublic information that the Secretary shares with the Accreditation Body concerning an OTP shall not be further disclosed except with the written permission of the Secretary.

        (d)  (1) Accreditation Bodies shall provide to the Secretary any documents and information requested by the Secretary within 5 days of receipt of the request.

        (2) Accreditation Bodies shall submit a summary of the results of each accreditation survey to the Secretary within 90 days following the survey visit. Such summaries shall contain sufficient detail to justify the accreditation action taken.

        (3) Accreditation Bodies shall provide the Secretary a list of each OTP surveyed, and the identity of all individuals involved in the conducting and reporting of survey results.

        (4) Accreditation Bodies shall submit to the Secretary the name of each OTP for which the Accreditation Body accredits conditionally, denies, suspends, or revokes accreditation, and the basis for the action, within 48 hours of the action.

        (5) Notwithstanding any reports made to the Secretary under paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section, each Accreditation Body shall submit to the Secretary semiannually, on January 15 and July 15 of each calendar year, a report consisting of a summary of the results of each accreditation survey conducted in the past year. The summary shall contain sufficient detail to justify each accreditation action taken.

        (6) All reporting requirements listed in this section shall be provided to the Secretary at the address specified in § 8.3(b).

        (e)  Accreditation Bodies shall have policies and procedures in place to respond to complaints received from the Secretary, patients, facility staff, and others within 5 business days from the receipt of the complaint. Accreditation Bodies shall also agree to notify the Secretary within 5 business days of receipt of a complaint from a patient, facility, staff or others, and to inform the Secretary of their response to the complaint.

        (f)  Accreditation Bodies shall obtain the Secretary's written authorization prior to making any substantive ( noneditorial) change in accreditation elements.

        (g)  The Accreditation Body shall maintain and apply policies and procedures that the Secretary has approved in accordance with § 8.3 to reduce the possibility of actual conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, on the part of individuals who act on behalf of the Accreditation Body. Individuals who participate in accreditation surveys or otherwise participate in the accreditation decision or an appeal of the accreditation decision, as well as their spouses and minor children, shall not have a financial interest in the OTP that is the subject of the accreditation survey or decision.

        (h)  (1) An Accreditation Body survey team shall consist of healthcare professionals with expertise in OUD treatment. The Accreditation Body shall consider factors such as the size of the OTP, the anticipated number of survey non-compliance issues, and the OTP's accreditation history in determining the composition of the team. At a minimum, survey teams shall consist of at least two healthcare professionals whose combined expertise includes:

        (i) The dispensing and administration of medications subject to control under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 );

        (ii) Medical issues relating to the dosing and administration of MOUD for the treatment of OUD;

        (iii) Psychosocial counseling of individuals receiving OUD treatment; and

        (iv) Organizational and administrative issues associated with OTPs.

        (2) Members of the accreditation team must be able to recuse themselves at any time from any survey in which either they or the OTP believes there is an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Conflict or perceived conflict of interest must be documented by the Accreditation Body and made available to the Secretary.

        (i)  Fees charged to OTPs for accreditation shall be reasonable. the Secretary generally will find fees to be reasonable if the fees are limited to recovering costs to the Accreditation Body, including overhead incurred. Accreditation Body activities that are not related to accreditation functions are not recoverable through fees established for accreditation.

        (1) The Accreditation Body shall make public its fee structure, including those factors, if any, contributing to variations in fees for different OTPs.

        (2) At the Secretary's request, Accreditation Bodies shall provide to the Secretary financial records or other materials, in a manner specified by the Secretary, to assist in assessing the reasonableness of Accreditation Body fees.

        § 8.5   Periodic evaluation of Accreditation Bodies.

#### § § 8.5

        The Secretary will periodically evaluate the performance of Accreditation Bodies primarily by inspecting a selected sample of the OTPs accredited by the Accrediting Body, and by evaluating the Accreditation Body's reports of surveys conducted, to determine whether the OTPs surveyed and accredited by the Accreditation Body are in compliance with applicable standards under this part. The evaluation will include a determination of whether there are major deficiencies in the Accreditation Body's performance that, if not corrected, would warrant withdrawal of the approval of the Accreditation Body under § 8.6.

        § 8.6   Withdrawal of approval of Accreditation Bodies.

#### § § 8.6

        If the Secretary determines that an Accreditation Body is not in substantial compliance with this subpart, the Secretary shall take appropriate action as follows:

        (a)  If the Secretary determines that the Accreditation Body has a major deficiency, such as commission of fraud, material false statement, failure to perform a major accreditation function satisfactorily, or significant noncompliance with the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary shall withdraw approval of that Accreditation Body.

        (1) In the event of a major deficiency, the Secretary shall notify the Accreditation Body of the agency's action and the grounds on which the approval was withdrawn.

        (2) An Accreditation Body that has lost its approval shall notify each OTP that has been accredited or is seeking accreditation that the Accreditation Body's approval has been withdrawn. Such notification shall be made within a time period and in a manner approved by the Secretary.

        (b)  If the Secretary determines that the Accreditation Body has minor deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation function, that are less serious or more limited than the types of deficiencies described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will notify the Body that it has 90 days to submit to the Secretary a plan of corrective action. The plan must include a summary of corrective actions and a schedule for their implementation. The Secretary may place the Body on probationary status for a period of time determined by the Secretary, or may withdraw approval of the Body if corrective action is not taken.

        (1) If the Secretary places an Accreditation Body on probationary status, the Body shall notify all OTPs that have been accredited, or that are seeking accreditation, of the Accreditation Body's probationary status within a time period and in a manner approved by the Secretary.

        (2) Probationary status will remain in effect until such time as the Body can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has successfully implemented or is implementing the corrective action plan within the established schedule, and the corrective actions taken have substantially eliminated all identified problems.

        (3) If the Secretary determines that an Accreditation Body that has been placed on probationary status is not implementing corrective actions satisfactorily or within the established schedule, the Secretary may withdraw approval of the Accreditation Body. The Accreditation Body shall notify all OTPs that have been accredited, or are seeking accreditation, of the Accreditation Body's loss of the Secretary's approval within a time period and in a manner approved by the Secretary.

        (c)  (1) An Accreditation Body that has had its approval withdrawn may submit a new application for approval if the Body can provide information to the Secretary to establish that the problems that were grounds for withdrawal of approval have been resolved.

        (2) If the Secretary determines that the new application demonstrates that the Body satisfactorily has addressed the causes of its previous unacceptable performance, the Secretary may reinstate approval of the Accreditation Body.

        (3) The Secretary may request additional information or establish additional conditions that must be met before the Secretary approves the reapplication.

        (4) The Secretary may refuse to accept an application from a former Accreditation Body whose approval was withdrawn because of fraud, material false statement, or willful disregard of public health.

        (d)  An opportunity to challenge an adverse action taken regarding withdrawal of approval of an Accreditation Body shall be addressed through the relevant procedures set forth in subpart C of this part, except that the procedures in § 8.28 for expedited review of an immediate suspension would not apply to an Accreditation Body that has been notified under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section of the withdrawal of its approval.

      Subpart C—Certification and Treatment Standards for Opioid Treatment Programs

        § 8.11   Opioid Treatment Program certification.

#### § § 8.11

        (a)  (1) An OTP must be the subject of a current, valid certification from the Secretary to be considered qualified by the Secretary under section 303(g)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823(h)(1)) to dispense MOUD in the treatment of OUD. An OTP must be determined to be qualified under section 303(g)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act, and must be determined to be qualified by the Attorney General under section 303(g)(1), to be registered by the Attorney General to dispense MOUD to individuals for treatment of OUD.

        (2) To obtain certification from the Secretary, an OTP must meet the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards in § 8.12, must be the subject of a current, valid accreditation by an Accreditation Body or other entity designated by the Secretary and must comply with any other conditions for certification established by the Secretary.

        (3) OTPs are expected to maintain certification with the Secretary and to comply with any other conditions for certification established by the Secretary. Certification shall be granted for a term not to exceed 3 years, except that certification may be renewed during the final certification year if the OTP applies for certification renewal in accordance with the steps outlined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (4) OTPs which satisfy the criteria for certification under this section may apply for renewal of their certification. OTPs are expected to apply for certification renewal during the final year of the OTP's certification period. OTPs should take steps to ensure that administrative tasks associated with renewal are completed before the OTP's certification expires. OTPs may apply for certification renewal in accordance with the procedures as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. If an OTP anticipates any delays in routine certification renewal, an extension may be requested by submitting to the Secretary a statement justifying the extension in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (5) OTPs that are certified and are seeking certification renewal, and who have been granted accreditation for one year by an Accreditation Body as provided under § 8.4(b)(1)(iii), may receive a conditional certification for one year unless the Secretary determines that such conditional certification would adversely affect patient health. An OTP must obtain a standard 3-year certification, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, within the 1-year conditional certification period. If standard accreditation is not obtained by the OTP within the 1-year conditional certification period, the OTP's conditional certification will lapse, and the Attorney General will be notified that the OTP's registration should be revoked.

        (6) OTPs whose certification has expired, and who seek re-certification, will be considered “new” programs and will be required to apply for provisional certification in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b)  Applications for certification must be submitted by the OTP using form SMA-162. The application for initial or renewal of certification shall include, as determined by the Secretary:

        (1) A description of the current accreditation status of the OTP;

        (2) A description of the organizational structure of the OTP;

        (3) The names of the persons responsible for the OTP;

        (4) The addresses of the OTP and of each medication unit or other facility under the of the OTP;

        (5) The sources of funding for the OTP and the name and address of each governmental entity that provides such funding;

        (6) A statement that the OTP will comply with the conditions of certification set forth in paragraph (g) of this section; and

        (7) The application shall be signed by the program sponsor who shall certify that the information submitted in the application is truthful and accurate.

        (8) Applications for re-certification shall include an explanation of why the OTP's most recent certification expired and information regarding the schedule for an accreditation survey.

        (c)  (1) Following the Secretary's receipt of an application for certification of an OTP, and after consultation with the appropriate State authority regarding the qualifications of the applicant, the Secretary may grant the application for certification, or renew an existing certification, if the Secretary determines that the OTP has satisfied the requirements for certification or renewal of certification in this section.

        (2) The Secretary may deny the application if the Secretary determines that:

        (i) The application for certification is deficient in any respect;

        (ii) The OTP will not be operated in accordance with the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards established under § 8.12;

        (iii) The OTP will not permit an inspection or a survey to proceed, or will not permit in a timely manner access to relevant records or information; or

        (iv) The OTP has made misrepresentations in obtaining accreditation or in applying for certification.

        (3) Within 5 days after it reaches a final determination that an OTP meets the requirements for certification in this section, the Secretary will notify the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the OTP has been determined to be qualified to provide OUD treatment under section 303(g)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act.

        (d)  New OTPs that have not received the Secretary's certification previously, except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, who are applying for certification from the Secretary, and who have applied for accreditation with an Accreditation Body, are eligible to receive provisional certification for up to 1 year. To receive provisional certification, an OTP shall submit the information required by paragraph (b) of this section to the Secretary along with a statement identifying the Accreditation Body to which the OTP has applied for accreditation, the date on which the OTP applied for accreditation, the dates of any accreditation surveys that have taken place or are expected to take place, and the expected schedule for completing the accreditation process. Provisional certification for up to 1 year will be granted, following receipt of the information described in this paragraph (d), unless the Secretary determines that patient health would be adversely affected by the granting of provisional certification.

        (e)  (1) OTPs shall comply with all pertinent Federal and State laws and regulations. Nothing in this part is intended to limit the authority of State and, as appropriate, local governmental entities to regulate the use of MOUD in the treatment of OUD. The provisions of this section requiring compliance with requirements imposed by State law, or the submission of applications or reports required by the State authority, do not apply to OTPs operated directly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indian Health Service, or any other department or agency of the United States.

        (2) OTPs shall allow, in accordance with Federal controlled substances laws and Federal confidentiality laws, inspections and surveys by duly authorized employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), by Accreditation Bodies, by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and by authorized employees of any other Federal governmental entity with legal authority to conduct inspections or surveys on an OTP's premises.

        (3) Disclosure of patient records maintained by an OTP is governed by the provisions of 42 CFR part 2 and 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, and every program must comply with these regulations, as applicable. Records on the receipt, storage, and distribution of MOUD are also subject to inspection under Federal controlled substances laws and under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 ). Federally sponsored treatment programs are subject to applicable Federal confidentiality statutes.

        (4) An OTP or medication unit or any part thereof, including any facility or any individual, shall permit a duly authorized employee of the Department of Health and Human Services or SAMHSA to have access to and to copy all records on the use of MOUD in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR part 2 and 45 CFR parts 160 and 164.

        (5) OTPs shall notify the Secretary in writing within 3 weeks of any replacement or other change in the status of the program sponsor or medical director.

        (6) OTPs shall comply with all regulations enforced by the DEA under 21 CFR chapter II and must be registered by the DEA before administering or dispensing MOUD.

        (7) OTPs must operate in accordance with Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards and approved accreditation elements.

        (f)  (1) Before an OTP may provide interim treatment, the OTP must receive the approval of both the Secretary and the SOTA of the State in which the OTP operates.

        (2) Before the Secretary may grant such approval, the OTP must provide the Secretary with documentation from the SOTA of the State in which the OTP operates demonstrating that:

        (i) Such officer does not object to the providing of interim treatment in the State;

        (ii) The OTP seeking to provide such treatment is unable to provide access for patients in a comprehensive treatment program within a reasonable geographic area within 14 days of the time patients seek treatment for OUD;

        (iii) The authorization of the OTP to provide interim treatment will not otherwise reduce the capacity of comprehensive treatment programs in the State to admit individuals (relative to the date on which such officer so certifies); and

        (iv) OTPs providing interim treatment will arrange for each individual's transfer to a comprehensive treatment program no later than 180 days from the date on which each individual first requested treatment. Individuals enrolled in interim treatment shall not be discharged without the approval of an OTP practitioner, who shall consider on-going and patient-centered treatment needs, which are to be documented in the patient record, while awaiting transfer to a comprehensive treatment program.

        (3) The Secretary will provide notice to the OTP denying or approving the request to provide interim treatment. The OTP shall not provide such treatment until it has received such notice from the Secretary.

        (g)  An OTP may, at the time of application for certification or any time thereafter, request from the Secretary exemption from the regulatory requirements set forth under this section and § 8.12. An example of a case in which an exemption might be granted would be for a private practitioner who wishes to treat a limited number of patients in a non-metropolitan area with few physicians and no OUD treatment services geographically accessible, and requests exemption from some of the staffing and service standards. The OTP shall support the rationale for the exemption with thorough documentation, to be supplied in an appendix to the initial application for certification or in a separate submission. The Secretary will approve or deny such exemptions at the time of application, or any time thereafter, if appropriate. The Secretary shall consult with the appropriate State authority prior to taking action on an exemption request.

        (h)  (1) Certified OTPs may establish medication units that are authorized to dispense MOUD. Before establishing a medication unit, a certified OTP must notify the Secretary by submitting form SMA-162. The OTP must also comply with the provisions of 21 CFR part 1300 before establishing a medication unit. Medication units shall comply with all pertinent State laws and regulations. Medication units include both mobile and brick and mortar facilities.

        (2) Specifically, any services that are provided in an OTP may be provided in the medication unit, assuming compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local law, and the use of units that provide appropriate privacy and have adequate space.

        (3) Certification as an OTP under this part is not required for the initiation or continuity of medication treatment or withdrawal management of a patient who is admitted to a hospital, long-term care facility, or correctional facility, that is registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration as a hospital/clinic, for the treatment of medical conditions other than OUD, and who requires treatment of OUD with methadone during their stay, when such treatment is permitted under applicable Federal law.

        (i) The term “long-term care facility” is defined in § 8.2. Nothing in this section is intended to relieve hospitals, or long-term care facilities and correctional facilities that are registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration as a hospital/clinic, from their obligations to obtain appropriate registration from the Attorney General, under section 303(g) of the Controlled Substances Act. Treatment provided under this section should always comply with applicable Federal laws.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        § 8.12   Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards.

#### § § 8.12

        (a)  OTPs must provide treatment in accordance with the standards in this section and must comply with these standards as a condition of certification.

        (b)  (1) An OTP's organizational structure and facilities shall be adequate to ensure quality patient care and to meet the requirements of all pertinent Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. At a minimum, each OTP shall formally designate a program sponsor and medical director. The program sponsor shall agree on behalf of the OTP to adhere to all requirements set forth in this part.

        (2) The medical director shall assume responsibility for all medical and behavioral health services performed by the OTP. In addition, the medical director shall be responsible for ensuring that the OTP is in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

        (c)  (1) An OTP must maintain current quality assurance and quality control plans that include, among other things, annual reviews of program policies and procedures and ongoing assessment of patient outcomes.

        (2) An OTP must maintain a current “Diversion Control Plan” or “DCP” as part of its quality assurance program that contains specific measures to reduce the possibility of diversion of dispensed MOUD, and that assigns specific responsibility to the OTP providers and administrative staff for carrying out the diversion control measures and functions described in the DCP.

        (d)  Each person engaged in the treatment of OUD must have sufficient education, training, and experience, or any combination thereof, to enable that person to perform the assigned functions. All practitioners and other licensed/certified health care providers, including counselors, must comply with the credentialing and maintenance of licensure and/or certification requirements of their respective professions.

        (e) —(1)  An OTP shall maintain current procedures designed to ensure that patients are admitted to treatment by qualified personnel who have determined, using accepted medical criteria, that: The person meets diagnostic criteria for a moderate to severe OUD; the individual has an active moderate to severe OUD, or OUD in remission, or is at high risk for recurrence or overdose. Such decisions must be appropriately documented in the patient's clinical record. In addition, a health care practitioner shall ensure that each patient voluntarily chooses treatment with MOUD and that all relevant facts concerning the use of MOUD are clearly and adequately explained to the patient, and that each patient provides informed consent to treatment.

        (2)  Except in States where State law grants persons under 18 years of age the ability to consent to OTP treatment without the consent of another, no person under 18 years of age may be admitted to OTP treatment unless a parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult designated by the relevant State authority consents in writing to such treatment.

        (3)  An OTP shall maintain current procedures that are designed to ensure that those patients who choose to taper from MOUD are provided the opportunity to do so with informed consent and at a mutually agreed-upon rate that minimizes taper-related risks. Such consent must be documented in the clinical record by the treating practitioner.

        (f) —(1)  OTPs shall provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other screening, assessment, and treatment services to meet patient needs, with the combination and frequency of services tailored to each individual patient based on an individualized assessment and the patient's care plan that was created after shared decision making between the patient and the clinical team. These services must be available at the primary facility, except where the program sponsor has entered into a documented agreement with a private or public agency, organization, practitioner, or institution to provide these services to patients enrolled in the OTP. The program sponsor, in any event, must be able to document that these services are fully and reasonably available to patients.

        (2)  (i) OTPs shall require each patient to undergo an initial medical examination. The initial medical examination is comprised of two parts:

        (A) A screening examination to ensure that the patient meets criteria for admission and that there are no contraindications to treatment with MOUD; and

        (B) A full history and examination, to determine the patient's broader health status, with lab testing as determined to be required by an appropriately licensed practitioner. A patient's refusal to undergo lab testing for co-occurring physical health conditions should not preclude them from access to treatment, provided such refusal does not have potential to negatively impact treatment with medications.

        (ii) Assuming no contraindications, a patient may commence treatment with MOUD after the screening examination has been completed. Both the screening examination and full examination must be completed by an appropriately licensed practitioner. If the licensed practitioner is not an OTP practitioner, the screening examination must be completed no more than seven days prior to OTP admission. Where the examination is performed outside of the OTP, the written results and narrative of the examination, as well as available lab testing results, must be transmitted, consistent with applicable privacy laws, to the OTP, and verified by an OTP practitioner.

        (iii) A full in-person physical examination, including the results of serology and other tests that are considered to be clinically appropriate, must be completed within 14 calendar days following a patient's admission to the OTP. The full exam can be completed by a non-OTP practitioner, if the exam is verified by a licensed OTP practitioner as being true and accurate and transmitted in accordance with applicable privacy laws.

        (iv) Serology testing and other testing as deemed medically appropriate by the licensed OTP practitioner based on the screening or full history and examination, drawn not more than 30 days prior to admission to the OTP, may form part of the full history and examination.

        (v) The screening and full examination may be completed via telehealth for those patients being admitted for treatment at the OTP with either buprenorphine or methadone, if a practitioner or primary care provider, determines that an adequate evaluation of the patient can be accomplished via telehealth. When using telehealth, the following caveats apply:

        (A) In evaluating patients for treatment with schedule II medications (such as Methadone), audio-visual telehealth platforms must be used, except when not available to the patient. When not available, it is acceptable to use audio-only devices, but only when the patient is in the presence of a licensed practitioner who is registered to prescribe (including dispense) controlled medications. The OTP practitioner shall review the examination results and order treatment medications as indicated.

        (B) In evaluating patients for treatment with schedule III medications (such as Buprenorphine) or medications not classified as a controlled medication (such as Naltrexone), audio-visual or audio only platforms may be used. The OTP practitioner shall review the examination results and order treatment medications as indicated.

        (3)  OTPs must maintain current policies and procedures that reflect the special needs and priority for treatment admission of patients with OUD who are pregnant. Pregnancy should be confirmed. Evidence-based treatment protocols for the pregnant patient, such as split dosing regimens, may be instituted after assessment by an OTP practitioner and documentation that confirms the clinical appropriateness of such an evidence-based treatment protocol. Prenatal care and other sex-specific services, including reproductive health services, for pregnant and postpartum patients must be provided and documented either by the OTP or by referral to appropriate healthcare practitioners. Specific services, including reproductive health services, for pregnant and postpartum patients must be provided and documented either by the OTP or by referral to appropriate healthcare practitioners.

        (4)  (i) Each patient admitted to an OTP shall be given a physical and behavioral health assessment, which includes but is not limited to screening for imminent risk of harm to self or others, within 14 calendar days following admission, and periodically by appropriately licensed/credentialed personnel. These assessments must address the need for and/or response to treatment, adjust treatment interventions, including MOUD, as necessary, and provide a patient-centered plan of care. The full, initial psychosocial assessment must be completed within 14 calendar days of admission and include preparation of a care plan that includes the patient's goals and mutually agreed-upon actions for the patient to meet those goals, including harm reduction interventions; the patient's needs and goals in the areas of education, vocational training, and employment; and the medical and psychiatric, psychosocial, economic, legal, housing, and other recovery support services that a patient needs and wishes to pursue. The care plan also must identify the recommended frequency with which services are to be provided. The plan must be reviewed and updated to reflect responses to treatment and recovery support services, and adjustments made that reflect changes in the context of the person's life, their current needs for and interests in medical, psychiatric, social, and psychological services, and current needs for and interests in education, vocational training, and employment services.

        (ii) The periodic physical examination should occur not less than one time each year and be conducted by an OTP practitioner. The periodic physical examination should include review of MOUD dosing, treatment response, other substance use disorder treatment needs, responses and patient-identified goals, and other relevant physical and psychiatric treatment needs and goals. The periodic physical examination should be documented in the patient's clinical record.

        (5)  (i) OTPs must provide adequate substance use disorder counseling and psychoeducation to each patient as clinically necessary and mutually agreed-upon, including harm reduction education and recovery-oriented counseling. This counseling shall be provided by a program counselor, qualified by education, training, or experience to assess the psychological and sociological background of patients, and engage with patients, to contribute to the appropriate care plan for the patient and to monitor and update patient progress. Patient refusal of counseling shall not preclude them from receiving MOUD.

        (ii) OTPs must provide counseling on preventing exposure to, and the transmission of, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and either directly provide services and treatments or actively link to treatment each patient admitted or readmitted to treatment who has received positive test results for these conditions from initial and/or periodic medical examinations.

        (iii) OTPs must provide directly, or through referral to adequate and reasonably accessible community resources, vocational training, education, and employment services for patients who request such services or for whom these needs have been identified and mutually agreed-upon as beneficial by the patient and program staff.

        (6)  When conducting random drug testing, OTPs must use drug tests that have received the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) marketing authorization for commonly used and misused substances that may impact patient safety, recovery, or otherwise complicate substance use disorder treatment, at a frequency that is in accordance with generally accepted clinical practice and as indicated by a patient's response to and stability in treatment, but no fewer than eight random drug tests per year patient, allowing for extenuating circumstances at the individual patient level. This requirement does not preclude distribution of legal harm reduction supplies that allow an individual to test their personal drug supply for adulteration with substances that increase the risk of overdose.

        (g)  (1) OTPs shall establish and maintain a recordkeeping system that is adequate to document and monitor patient care. This system is required to comply with all Federal and State reporting requirements relevant to MOUD approved for use in treatment of OUD. All records are required to be kept confidential in accordance with all applicable Federal and State requirements.

        (2) OTPs shall include, as an essential part of the recordkeeping system, documentation in each patient's record that the OTP made a good faith effort to determine whether the patient is enrolled in any other OTP. A patient enrolled in an OTP shall not be permitted to obtain treatment in any other OTP except in circumstances involving an inability to access care at the patient's OTP of record. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, travel for work or family events, temporary relocation, or an OTP's temporary closure. If the medical director or program practitioner of the OTP in which the patient is enrolled determines that such circumstances exist, the patient may seek treatment at another OTP, provided the justification for the particular circumstances are noted in the patient's record both at the OTP in which the patient is enrolled and at the OTP that will provide the MOUD.

        (h)  (1) OTPs must ensure that MOUD are administered or dispensed only by a practitioner licensed under the appropriate State law and registered under the appropriate State and Federal laws to administer or dispense MOUD, or by an agent of such a practitioner, supervised by and under the order of the licensed practitioner and if consistent with Federal and State law.

        (2) OTPs shall use only those MOUD that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) for use in the treatment of OUD. In addition, OTPs who are fully compliant with the protocol of an investigational use of a drug and other conditions set forth in the application may administer a drug that has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an investigational new drug application under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for investigational use in the treatment of OUD. Currently the following MOUD will be considered to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of OUD:

        (i) Methadone;

        (ii) Buprenorphine and buprenorphine combination products that have been approved for use in the treatment of OUD; and

        (iii) Naltrexone.

        (3) OTPs shall maintain current procedures that are adequate to ensure that the following dosage form and initial dosing requirements are met:

        (i) Methadone shall be administered or dispensed only in oral form and shall be formulated in such a way as to reduce its potential for parenteral misuse.

        (ii) For each new patient enrolled in an OTP, the initial dose of methadone shall be individually determined and shall include consideration of the type(s) of opioid(s) involved in the patient's opioid use disorder, other medications or substances being taken, medical history, and severity of opioid withdrawal. The total dose for the first day should not exceed 50 milligrams unless the OTP practitioner, licensed under the appropriate State law and registered under the appropriate State and Federal laws to administer or dispense MOUD, finds sufficient medical rationale, including but not limited to if the patient is transferring from another OTP on a higher dose that has been verified, and documents in the patient's record that a higher dose was clinically indicated.

        (4) OTPs shall maintain current procedures adequate to ensure that each MOUD used by the program is administered and dispensed in accordance with its FDA approved product labeling. The program must ensure that any significant deviations from the approved labeling, including deviations with regard to dose, frequency, or the conditions of use described in the approved labeling, are specifically documented in the patient's record.

        (i)  Unsupervised or “take-home” medication doses may be provided under the following circumstances:

        (1) Any patient in comprehensive treatment may receive their individualized take-home doses as ordered for days that the clinic is closed for business, including one weekend day ( Sunday) and State and Federal holidays, no matter their length of time in treatment.

        (2) OTP decisions on dispensing MOUD to patients for unsupervised use beyond that set forth in paragraph (i)(1) of this section shall be determined by an appropriately licensed OTP medical practitioner or the medical director. In determining which patients may receive unsupervised medication doses, the medical director or program medical practitioner shall consider, among other pertinent factors that indicate that the therapeutic benefits of unsupervised doses outweigh the risks, the following criteria:

        (i) Absence of active substance use disorders, other physical or behavioral health conditions that increase the risk of patient harm as it relates to the potential for overdose, or the ability to function safely;

        (ii) Regularity of attendance for supervised medication administration;

        (iii) Absence of serious behavioral problems that endanger the patient, the public or others;

        (iv) Absence of known recent diversion activity;

        (v) Whether take-home medication can be safely transported and stored; and

        (vi) Any other criteria that the medical director or medical practitioner considers relevant to the patient's safety and the public's health.

        (3) Such determinations and the basis for such determinations consistent with the criteria outlined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall be documented in the patient's medical record. If it is determined that a patient is safely able to manage unsupervised doses of MOUD, the dispensing restrictions set forth in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. The dispensing restrictions set forth in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section do not apply to buprenorphine and buprenorphine products listed under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (i) During the first 14 days of treatment, the take-home supply (beyond that of paragraph (i)(1) of this section) is limited to 7 days. It remains within the OTP practitioner's discretion to determine the number of take-home doses up to 7 days, but decisions must be based on the criteria listed in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The rationale underlying the decision to provide unsupervised doses of methadone must be documented in the patient's clinical record, consistent with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (ii) From 15 days of treatment, the take-home supply (beyond that of paragraph (i)(1) of this section) is limited to 14 days. It remains within the OTP practitioner's discretion to determine the number of take-home doses up to 14 days, but this determination must be based on the criteria listed in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The rationale underlying the decision to provide unsupervised doses of methadone must be documented in the patient's clinical record, consistent with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (iii) From 31 days of treatment, the take-home supply (beyond that of paragraph (i)(1) of this section) provided to a patient is not to exceed 28 days. It remains within the OTP practitioner's discretion to determine the number of take-home doses up to 28 days, but this determination must be based on the criteria listed in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The rationale underlying the decision to provide unsupervised doses of methadone must be documented in the patient's clinical record, consistent with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (4) OTPs must maintain current procedures adequate to identify the theft or diversion of take-home medications, including labeling containers with the OTP's name, address, and telephone number. Programs also must ensure that each individual take-home dose is packaged in a manner that is designed to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion, including child-proof containers (see Poison Prevention Packaging Act, Pub. L. 91-601 (15 U.S.C. 1471 )). Programs must provide education to each patient on: Safely transporting medication from the OTP to their place of residence; and the safe storage of take-home doses at the individual's place of residence, including child and household safety precautions. The provision of this education should be documented in the patient's clinical record.

        (j)  (1) The program sponsor of an OTP may admit an individual, who is eligible for admission to comprehensive treatment, into interim treatment if comprehensive services are not readily available within a reasonable geographic area and within 14 days of the individual's seeking treatment. At least two drug tests shall be obtained from patients during the maximum of 180 days permitted for interim treatment. A program shall establish and follow reasonable criteria for establishing priorities for moving patients from interim to comprehensive treatment. These transition criteria shall be in writing and shall include, at a minimum, prioritization of pregnant patients in admitting patients to interim treatment and from interim to comprehensive treatment. Interim treatment shall be provided in a manner consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws, including sections 1923, 1927(a), and 1976 of the Public Health Service Act (21 U.S.C. 300x-23, 300x-27(a), and 300y-11).

        (2) The program shall notify the SOTA when a patient begins interim treatment, when a patient leaves interim treatment, and before the date of transfer to comprehensive services, and shall document such notifications.

        (3) The Secretary may revoke the interim authorization for programs that fail to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (j). Likewise, the Secretary will consider revoking the interim authorization of a program if the State in which the program operates is not in compliance with the provisions of § 8.11(h).

        (4) All requirements for comprehensive treatment apply to interim treatment with the following exceptions:

        (i) A primary counselor is not required to be assigned to the patient, but crisis services, including shelter support, should be available;

        (ii) Interim treatment cannot be provided for longer than 180 days in any 12-month period;

        (iii) By day 120, a plan for continuing treatment beyond 180 days must be created, and documented in the patient's clinical record; and

        (iv) Formal counseling, vocational training, employment, economic, legal, educational, and other recovery support services described in paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5)(i) and (iii) of this section are not required to be offered to the patient. However, information pertaining to locally available, community-based resources for ancillary services should be made available to individual patients in interim treatment.

        § 8.13   Revocation of accreditation and Accreditation Body approval.

#### § § 8.13

        (a)  If an Accreditation Body revokes an OTP's accreditation, the Secretary may conduct an investigation into the reasons for the revocation. Following such investigation, the Secretary may determine that the OTP's certification should no longer be in effect, at which time the Secretary will initiate procedures to revoke the program's certification in accordance with § 8.14. Alternatively, the Secretary may determine that another action or combination of actions would better serve the public health, including the establishment and implementation of a corrective plan of action that will permit the certification to continue in effect while the OTP seeks reaccreditation.

        (b)  (1) If the Secretary withdraws the approval of an Accreditation Body under § 8.6, the certifications of OTPs accredited by such Body shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after the date of withdrawal of approval of the Accreditation Body, unless the Secretary determines that to protect public health or safety, or because the Accreditation Body fraudulently accredited treatment programs, the certifications of some or all of the programs should be revoked or suspended or that a shorter time period should be established for the certifications to remain in effect. The Secretary may extend the time in which a certification remains in effect under this paragraph (b)(1) on a case-by-case basis.

        (2) Within 1 year from the date of withdrawal of approval of an Accreditation Body, or within any shorter period of time established by the Secretary, OTPs currently accredited by the Accreditation Body must obtain accreditation from another Accreditation Body. The Secretary may extend the time period for obtaining reaccreditation on a case-by-case basis.

        § 8.14   Suspension or revocation of certification.

#### § § 8.14

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may revoke the certification of an OTP if the Secretary finds, after providing the program sponsor with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with this subpart, that the program sponsor, or any employee of the OTP:

        (1) Has been found to have engaged in misrepresentation in obtaining the certification;

        (2) Has failed to comply with the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards in any respect;

        (3) Has failed to comply with reasonable requests from the Secretary or from an Accreditation Body for records, information, reports, or materials that are necessary to determine the continued eligibility of the OTP for certification or continued compliance with the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards; or

        (4) Has refused a reasonable request of a duly designated inspector, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Inspector, State Inspector, or Accreditation Body representative for permission to inspect the program or the program's operations or its records.

        (b)  Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that revocation may be required and that immediate action is necessary to protect public health or safety, the Secretary may immediately suspend the certification of an OTP, and notify the Attorney General that the OTP's registration should be suspended, before holding a hearing under this subpart. The Secretary may immediately suspend as well as propose revocation of the certification of an OTP before holding a hearing under this subpart if the Secretary makes a finding described in paragraph (a) of this section and also determines that:

        (1) The failure to comply with the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards presents an imminent danger to the public health or safety;

        (2) The refusal to permit inspection makes immediate suspension necessary; or

        (3) There is reason to believe that the failure to comply with the Federal Opioid Use Disorder treatment standards was intentional or was associated with fraud.

        (c)  In the event that the Secretary suspends the certification of an OTP in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or proposes to revoke the certification of an OTP in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall promptly provide the sponsor of the OTP with written notice of the suspension or proposed revocation by facsimile transmission, personal service, commercial overnight delivery service, or certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall state the reasons for the action, state that the OTP may seek review of the action in accordance with the procedures in this subpart, and identify the reviewing official to whom a written request for review may be submitted.

        (d)  (1) If the Secretary suspends certification in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:

        (i) The Secretary will immediately notify DEA that the OTP's registration should be suspended under 21 U.S.C. 824(d); and

        (ii) the Secretary will provide an opportunity for a hearing under this subpart.

        (2) Suspension of certification under paragraph (b) of this section shall remain in effect until the agency determines that:

        (i) The basis for the suspension cannot be substantiated;

        (ii) Violations of required standards have been corrected to the agency's satisfaction; or

        (iii) The OTP's certification shall be revoked.

        (b)  Within 5 days after receiving the request for review, the reviewing official will send an acknowledgment and advise the appellant of the next steps. The reviewing official will also send a copy of the acknowledgment to the respondent.

        § 8.26   Preparation of the review file and written arguments.

#### § § 8.26

        The appellant and the respondent each participate in developing the file for the reviewing official and in submitting written arguments. The procedures for development of the review file and submission of written argument are:

        (a)  Within 30 days after receiving the acknowledgment of the request for review, the appellant shall submit to the reviewing official the following (with a copy to the respondent):

        (1) A review file containing the documents supporting appellant's argument, tabbed and organized chronologically, and accompanied by an index identifying each document. Only essential documents should be submitted to the reviewing official.

        (2) A written statement, not to exceed 20 double-spaced pages, explaining why respondent's decision to suspend or propose revocation of appellant's certification or to take adverse action regarding withdrawal of approval of the Accreditation Body is incorrect (appellant's brief).

        (b)  Within 30 days after receiving a copy of the acknowledgment of the request for review, the respondent shall submit to the reviewing official the following (with a copy to the appellant):

        (1) A review file containing documents supporting respondent's decision to suspend or revoke appellant's certification, or approval as an Accreditation Body, tabbed and organized chronologically, and accompanied by an index identifying each document. Only essential documents should be submitted to the reviewing official.

        (2) A written statement, not exceeding 20 double-spaced pages in length, explaining the basis for suspension, proposed revocation, or adverse action (respondent's brief).

        (c)  Within 10 days after receiving the opposing party's submission, or 20 days after receiving acknowledgment of the request for review, whichever is later, each party may submit a short reply not to exceed 10 double-spaced pages.

        (d)  Whenever feasible, the parties should attempt to develop a joint review file.

        (e)  The reviewing official may take any appropriate steps to reduce excessive documentation, including the return of or refusal to consider documentation found to be irrelevant, redundant, or unnecessary.

        (f)  The use of interrogatories, depositions, and other forms of discovery shall not be allowed.

        § 8.27   Opportunity for oral presentation.

#### § § 8.27

        (a)  If an opportunity for an oral presentation is desired, the appellant shall request it at the time it submits its written request for review to the reviewing official. The reviewing official will grant the request if the official determines that the decision-making process will be substantially aided by oral presentations and arguments. The reviewing official may also provide for an oral presentation at the official's own initiative or at the request of the respondent.

        (b)  The reviewing official or designee will be the presiding official responsible for managing the oral presentations.

        (c)  The presiding official may hold a prehearing conference (usually a telephone conference call) to consider any of the following: Simplifying and clarifying issues; stipulations and admissions; limitations on evidence and witnesses that will be presented at the hearing; time allotted for each witness and the hearing altogether; scheduling the hearing; and any other matter that will assist in the review process. Normally, this conference will be conducted informally and off the record; however, the presiding official may, at the presiding official's discretion, produce a written document summarizing the conference or transcribe the conference.

        (d)  The presiding official will attempt to schedule the oral presentation within 45 days of the date appellant's request for review is received or within 15 days of submission of the last reply brief, whichever is later. The oral presentation will be held at a time and place determined by the presiding official following consultation with the parties.

        (e) —(1)  The presiding official is responsible for conducting the oral presentation. The presiding official may be assisted by one or more HHS officers or employees or consultants in conducting the oral presentation and reviewing the evidence. While the oral presentation will be kept as informal as possible, the presiding official may take all necessary steps to ensure an orderly proceeding.

        (2)  In all cases, the respondent bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that its decision to suspend, propose revocation, or take adverse action is appropriate. The appellant, however, has a responsibility to respond to the respondent's allegations with evidence and argument to show that the respondent is incorrect.

        (3)  The rules of evidence do not apply, and the presiding official will generally admit all testimonial evidence unless it is clearly irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious. Each party may make an opening and closing statement, may present witnesses as agreed upon in the pre-hearing conference or otherwise, and may question the opposing party's witnesses. Since the parties have ample opportunity to prepare the review file, a party may introduce additional documentation during the oral presentation only with the permission of the presiding official. The presiding official may question witnesses directly and take such other steps necessary to ensure an effective and efficient consideration of the evidence, including setting time limitations on direct and cross-examinations.

        (4)  The presiding official may rule on motions including, for example, motions to exclude or strike redundant or immaterial evidence, motions to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence, or motions for summary judgment. Except for those made during the hearing, all motions and opposition to motions, including argument, must be in writing and be no more than 10 double-spaced pages in length. The presiding official will set a reasonable time for the party opposing the motion to reply.

        (5)  The presiding official shall have the oral presentation transcribed. Either party may request a copy of the transcript and the requesting party shall be responsible for paying for its copy of the transcript.

        (f)  Obstruction of justice or the making of false statements by a witness or any other person may be the basis for a criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 or 1505.

        (g)  At the presiding official's discretion, the presiding official may require or permit the parties to submit post-hearing briefs or proposed findings and conclusions. Each party may submit comments on any major prejudicial errors in the transcript.

        § 8.28   Expedited procedures for review of immediate suspension.

#### § § 8.28

        (a)  When the Secretary notifies an OTP in writing that its certification has been immediately suspended, the appellant may request an expedited review of the suspension and any proposed revocation. The appellant must submit this request in writing to the reviewing official within 10 days of the date the OTP received notice of the suspension. The request for review must include a copy of the suspension and any proposed revocation, a brief statement of why the decision to suspend and propose revocation is incorrect, and the appellant's request for an oral presentation, if desired. A copy of the request for review must also be sent to the respondent.

        (b)  As soon as practicable after the request for review is received, the reviewing official will send an acknowledgment with a copy to the respondent.

The presiding official may hold a pre-hearing conference in accordance with § 8.27(c) and will conduct the oral presentation in accordance with the procedures of § 8.27(e), (f), and (g).

        (e)  The reviewing official shall issue a written decision upholding or denying the suspension or proposed revocation and will attempt to issue the decision within 7 to 10 days of the date of the oral presentation or within 3 days of the date on which the transcript is received or the date of the last submission by either party, whichever is later. All other provisions set forth in § 8.33 apply.

        (f)  Because of the importance of timeliness for the expedited procedures in this section, all written communications between the parties and between either party and the reviewing official shall be sent by facsimile transmission, personal service, or commercial overnight delivery service.

        § 8.29   Ex parte communications.

#### § § 8.29

        For the purposes of maintaining the equity of informal review proceedings, except for routine administrative and procedural matters or as described in §§ 8.22(2) and 8.27(e), a party shall not communicate with the reviewing or presiding official without notice to the other party.

        § 8.30   Transmission of written communications by reviewing official and calculation of deadlines.

#### § § 8.30

        (a)  Because of the importance of a timely review, the reviewing official should normally transmit written communications to either party by facsimile transmission, personal service, or commercial overnight delivery service, or certified mail, return receipt requested, in which case the date of transmission or day following mailing will be considered the date of receipt. In the case of communications sent by regular mail, the date of receipt will be considered 3 days after the date of mailing.

        (b)  In counting days, include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. However, if a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, then the due date is the next Federal working day.

Offspring born in the sanctuary is owned by the Sanctuary Contractor.

      means the use of procedures that depend upon close observation of chimpanzee behavior or on medical information collected during the course of normal veterinary care. These procedures do not require removal of the chimpanzees from their social group or environment, or require a separate anesthetic or sedation event to collect data or record observations. Some examples of noninvasive studies are:

      (1) Visual observation;

      (2) Behavioral studies designed to improve the establishment and maintenance of social groups. These activities may cause stress as a result of novel interactions between chimpanzees and caregivers, but they are not considered invasive as long as they are intended to maximize the well-being of the chimpanzees;

      (3) Medical examinations as deemed necessary to oversee the health of the chimpanzees, in the least invasive manner possible. Collection of samples routinely obtained during a physical examination for processing during this time is also considered noninvasive since a separate event is not required;

      (4) Administration and evaluation of environmental enrichment used to promote the psychological well-being of the chimpanzees; and

      (5) Actions taken to provide essential medical treatment to an individual chimpanzee exhibiting symptoms of illness. This applies only to serious illness that cannot be treated while the chimpanzee remains within the colony.

      means corrals, Primadomes (a prefabricated outdoor housing unit), fenced open areas, or similar structures or areas for maintaining chimpanzees with access to adequate protection from the extremes of environmental elements and harsh weather conditions.

      area means an area that allows chimpanzees greater ranging space than corrals or other outdoor housing area and includes a variety of vegetation, shrubbery, grasses and trees, thereby providing for a fairly unrestricted natural setting for the chimpanzees to engage in species-appropriate activities.

      means the sanctuary or sanctuary system established by the Federal Government through contracting with a private, nonprofit entity, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the CHIMP Act of 2000. The system includes a primary Contractor and may include additional subcontractors as required. This sanctuary system is supported primarily from funds allocated by ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH/HHS with some matching funds from the nonprofit contractor.

      means the _Secretary_ of Health and Human Services or his/her designee.

      means a private, nonprofit entity selected by the primary contractor to provide additional sanctuary services.

      means chimpanzees that are no longer needed in research and that were used, or were bred or purchased for use, in research conducted or supported by the Federal Government.

      § 9.5   Chimpanzee ownership, fees, and studies.

#### § § 9.5

      (a)  The Federal Government retains ownership of chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government at the time they enter the sanctuary system. Non-federally owned or supported chimpanzees will be owned by the sanctuary. The chimpanzees shall continue to be maintained in the sanctuary throughout their lifetime and shall not be discharged from the sanctuary except as specifically indicated in the CHIMP Act.

      (b)  No fees shall be charged by the Sanctuary Contractor for federally owned or supported chimpanzees entering the sanctuary. Chimpanzees that were owned by a NPRC when the CHIMP Act became effective are also admitted without payment of fees. Fees for maintenance of the chimpanzees alluded to above are provided for in the contract between the Federal Government and the Sanctuary Contractor.

      (c)  The sanctuary may accept chimpanzees that are not owned by the Federal Government subject to the following conditions:

      (1) Ownership of the chimpanzee must be transferred to the sanctuary;

      (2) Fees for these chimpanzees may be levied based on a range of considerations that include most importantly, the well-being of the chimpanzee and, secondarily, factors that include (but are not limited to) the resources available to support the chimpanzee; the health, age, and social history of the chimpanzee; and other relevant factors affecting the cost of caring for the chimpanzee. While chimpanzees not owned or supported by the Federal Government may be admitted to the sanctuary, federal funds may not be used for their support unless authorized by the Secretary or an authorized designee;

      (3) Available space exists in the sanctuary; and

      (4) An agreement exists between the sanctuary system and the ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH documenting that the chimpanzee may be brought into the sanctuary.

      (d)  The following additional conditions apply when nongovernmental owned chimpanzees transfer to the chimpanzee sanctuary:

      (1) Chimpanzees transferred to the sanctuary sites must be permanently incapable of reproduction, for example, by vasectomy, tubal ligation, or another reliable procedure;

      (2) Complete histories must accompany each chimpanzee. Any chimpanzee missing documentation for any period of research or other use may not be transferred to the Sanctuary without the concurrent authorization of the Sanctuary Contractor's Board of Directors and the ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH; the records may be created and retained in electronic form; and

      (3) Appropriate screening of each chimpanzee must be performed to assess the likelihood of the chimpanzee being a health or safety threat to the care staff and/or other chimpanzees.

      (e)  The chimpanzee Sanctuary Contractor, in conjunction with ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH , must establish criteria and a fee system for acceptance of nongovernmental owned chimpanzees. Funds collected for this purpose must be accounted for and used to help defray the expenses incurred in operating the sanctuary.

      (f)  In December 2007, the CHIMP Act was amended by the “Chimp Haven is Home Act,” which terminated the authority for the removal of chimpanzees from the sanctuary system for research purposes.

      § 9.6   Animal care, well-being, husbandry, veterinary care, and euthanasia.

#### § § 9.6

      (a)  The goal of chimpanzee housing and management in the sanctuary is to promote the chimpanzees' well-being.

      (b)  Adequate and proper care for chimpanzees in the sanctuary must be provided with respect to physical environment, housing and husbandry, behavioral management, and population management and control. Specific requirements include the following:

      (1) Chimpanzees must have access to food, water, and bedding at all times, unless medical or behavioral conditions dictate otherwise. Husbandry procedures shall represent current policies and practices and conform to standards set by a nationally recognized accrediting association in accordance with the  (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (a) of § 9.4).

      (2) Indoor primary enclosures must be cleaned as often as required to maintain a clean and healthy environment, with a minimum of once daily. Outdoor enclosures must be monitored daily and cleaned on a routine basis. Outdoor ranging areas will not require a routine cleaning schedule but must be monitored for excessive accumulation of waste or other unhealthy conditions. Housing areas shall provide sufficient space for chimpanzees to perform species-typical behavior and expression. Examples of such activities include but are not limited to natural movements, climbing, swinging, resting, running, group interactions, sleeping, etc. Feeding and watering implements must be sanitized at intervals required to maintain them in a sanitary condition, in accordance with the  (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (a) of § 9.4).

      (3) The federally supported chimpanzee sanctuary must employ a behavioral scientist knowledgeable in primate behavior and socialization requirements. This individual shall provide primary leadership in developing, implementing, and monitoring the chimpanzee behavioral guidelines for the sanctuary. Enrichment techniques used shall be currently accepted practices. The sanctuary must provide for the expertise to plan, administer, and evaluate the effectiveness of the well-being program.

      (4) Many chimpanzees can be trained through positive reinforcement to cooperate with a variety of veterinary and chimpanzee care procedures. Efforts must be made to develop or maintain this capability for chimpanzees housed in the sanctuary to the extent possible. Trainers must use currently acceptable practices that do not include physical punishment.

      (c)  The sanctuary staff must provide sufficient resources of personnel, equipment, supplies, and facilities to enable the provision of adequate veterinary care as set forth in the  (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (b) of § 9.4). For additional guidance see the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine document, “The Provision of Adequate Veterinary Care,” available on the Internet at

      (1) If the sanctuary houses chimpanzees with infectious diseases, it must have a veterinarian knowledgeable in the infectious diseases and care of chimpanzees. The Facility Veterinarian is responsible for establishing and implementing a health monitoring system specifically designed to meet the health requirements of chimpanzees in the sanctuary. Routine observation and the prevention of disease, metabolic conditions, abnormal behavior and injury must be a priority focus of the Facility Veterinarian and staff.

      (2) Newly received chimpanzees must be quarantined for a period for physiological, psychological, and nutritional stabilization before their introduction to the rest of the group. The stabilization period must be lengthened appropriately if the chimpanzee has a significant medical problem or if abnormal medical findings are detected during the quarantine period. If the chimpanzee has not been given a complete physical examination within six months, an examination must be conducted during the stabilization period.

      (3) The sanctuary must implement appropriate methods for disease surveillance and diagnosis of diseases, which may include the following:

      (4) Tuberculin (TB) tests must be negative for two (2) consecutive tests before the chimpanzee is released from quarantine. Any chimpanzee that is suspected of harboring the TB organism, or that is diagnosed with TB will be isolated and treated until determined by the Facility Veterinarian to be of no health risk to other chimpanzees or humans. The Facility Veterinarian may recommend euthanasia in those cases that do not respond to therapy and in which the chimpanzee consequently experiences undue pain and suffering that cannot be alleviated. The procedures noted under § 9.6 (d) must be observed if euthanasia is necessary.

      (5) Fecal samples must be checked for parasites and parasitic ova.

      (6) A complete blood count and serum chemical panel must be obtained.

      (7) Additional serum for banking and/or testing shall be obtained as appropriate by the Facility Veterinarian and is considered beneficial for chimpanzee health.

      (8) If the donating facility did not test for the appropriate viruses, the sanctuary must perform a viral panel and serology for the various chronic hepatitis viruses and HIV.

      (9) Additional tests or procedures that are deemed beneficial to the chimpanzees' health may be required by the Facility Veterinarian.

      (10) Chimpanzees are susceptible to many of the vaccine preventable diseases of human childhood. Appropriate vaccines must be considered and administered if deemed necessary, at the discretion of the Facility Veterinarian, to protect the chimpanzees in the sanctuary. Methods of disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy must comply with those currently accepted in veterinary medical practice. Arrangements with diagnostic laboratories must be established before chimpanzees arrive at the sanctuary.

      (11) The sanctuary must minimize the use of physical and chemical restraint. Chimpanzees in the sanctuary shall be trained to permit certain procedures with minimal or no restraint. Such procedures may include injections, dosing or other treatments, and cage-side health observations. However, chemical sedation sometimes may be appropriate for certain necessary medical interventions or for the safety of the chimpanzee and caregivers. If physical restraint measures are necessary, due consideration must be given to the temporary or permanent effects upon the chimpanzee and human and animal safety concerns.

      (12) Methods used to relieve pain must be documented in the chimpanzee medical or surgical records. These records will be available for review by USDA and NIH representatives. The Facility Veterinarian must ensure that pain management is current and in accordance with acceptable veterinary medical practices.

      (13) Chimpanzees must be cared for by qualified personnel on a daily basis, including weekends and holidays, to safeguard their well-being. Emergency veterinary care must also be available during these times. Notification procedures must be documented in the form of operating procedures.

      (d)  As stated in section 481C(d)(2)(I) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by section 2 of the CHIMP Act, none of the chimpanzees may be subjected to euthanasia except when it is in the best interest of the chimpanzee involved as determined by the SCCC and the Facility Veterinarian. Therefore, euthanasia for medical or humane reasons is permitted. Euthanasia may be permitted for reasons of health or quality of life of the individual chimpanzee, including for disease, in connection with trauma, complications of aging, or for other humane reasons. The sanctuary must establish a policy on euthanasia that will provide conditions that must be met before euthanasia is permitted and guidance for performing euthanasia.

      (1) Methods of euthanasia will be consistent with the most recent report of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia (2002), unless more reliable data becomes available. When euthanasia is performed, the veterinarian will determine the appropriate agent, and it will be administered only by properly trained personnel under the direction of the Facility Veterinarian. The decision to perform euthanasia will be made by the veterinarian in consultation with the Facility Director or Deputy Director.

      (2) The SCCC will participate in the decision in nonmedical emergencies. All euthanasia decisions must be reviewed by the SCCC, preferably prior to euthanasia. In emergencies, where euthanasia has to be performed immediately by the Facility Veterinarian, the circumstances and the decision by the Facility Veterinarian will be presented at the next scheduled or special meeting of the SCCC. The ORIP/DPCPSI Project Officer must be notified of the euthanasia event within 72 hours by electronic or telephonic means. Euthanasia of individual chimpanzees may negatively affect the care staff and appropriate counseling and psychological support shall be considered.

      § 9.7   Reproduction.

#### § § 9.7

      Chimpanzee reproduction is prohibited in the sanctuary. Therefore, all males must be sterilized by vasectomy before acceptance into the system, or, as a temporary measure, housed apart from females until they are sterilized. Vasectomies are advisable because they are minimally invasive and because effectiveness of the vasectomy may be validated through laboratory testing for semen. Seminal collection techniques must be carefully evaluated to avoid painful stimuli. Other proven methods of birth control may be used under special conditions deemed appropriate by the Facility Veterinarian and SCCC. The Facility Veterinarian must determine the appropriate test(s) to use to validate sterility. A veterinarian experienced in performing vasectomies in chimpanzees should perform the operation. Documentation must accompany each male accepted to the sanctuary system attesting to the fact that the male has been vasectomized and laboratory tests confirm that a segment of the Vas Deferens has been removed, or that the test used is reliable and is negative for sperm. The sanctuary must have a contingency plan for handling accidental births that includes the length of time the offspring is expected to remain with the mother.

      § 9.8   Animal records.

#### § § 9.8

      (a)  (1) Contractors and Subcontractors operating the federal chimpanzee sanctuary system must maintain appropriate records to allow for accountability and disposition of chimpanzees under their care as required by the USDA Animal Welfare Regulations (9 CFR 2.35). The records may be created and retained in electronic form.

      (2) The animal records currently required by the USDA Animal Welfare Regulations are also required for these standards. Chimpanzees must be individually and permanently identifiable.

      (3) Retrievable records must be maintained for a minimum of three years beyond the disposition or death of each chimpanzee in accordance with the Animal Welfare Regulations section 2.35(f) (9 CFR 2.35(f)). Original records or a copy must be transferred if the chimpanzee moves to a different facility. The records must include standard information, including permanent individual identification, research use(s), reproductive status (past and present), a summary or copy of the medical and behavioral history, the sire's identification number (if available), the dam's identification number, birth date, sex, and date acquired by the sanctuary. The disposition date must also be noted, if applicable, including whether the chimpanzee died or was transferred to another site in the federal sanctuary system. The records may be created and retained in electronic form.

      (4) The contractor and any subcontractor(s) operating the federally supported chimpanzee sanctuary must provide special, quarterly, and annual progress reports to the designated Federal officials as identified in the contract. The annual report must also contain a statement that certifies the sanctuary is in full compliance with these standards of care regulation.

      (b)  The CHIMP Act requires that necropsy records from chimpanzees previously used in federally funded research projects be made available on a reasonable basis to investigators engaged in biomedical or behavioral research. In order to comply with this provision, the contractor for the sanctuary system must devise a plan that will allow interested parties to contact the sanctuary and receive necropsy records when they become available. Records may be provided free of charge but requesters may be required to pay for packaging and shipping costs. The records may be created and retained in electronic form.

      § 9.9   Facility staffing.

#### § § 9.9

      (a) The professional, managerial, and support staff must be sufficient to support the scope and diversity of the activities and chimpanzee population of the sanctuary. The level of staffing shall be adequate to ensure that the chimpanzees receive appropriate health care, are well cared for, and the administrative and fiscal operations are sound and in keeping with current practices required by ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH ;

      (b) There must be a sufficient number of appropriately trained animal care and technical personnel to provide appropriate care to the chimpanzees at all times, including evenings, weekends, and holidays. The number of animal care staff to chimpanzee ratio shall be adjusted as experience is gained during the operation of the sanctuary. Sufficiently trained staff also must be available to maintain adequate behavioral enrichment;

      (c) The Facility Director must be a person with experience in chimpanzee care and socialization techniques. In addition, the Director must have management and administrative experience;

      (d) The Biosafety Officer must have experience in developing and monitoring biohazards and dealing with biosafety issues related to captive nonhuman primates. Experience in these areas dealing specifically with chimpanzees is desirable;

      (e) The remaining staff, which may include part-time, full-time, or contractor Facility Veterinarian(s) and Behaviorist(s), must possess the skills, knowledge, and/or experience required to perform their duties, as elaborated within the regulation.

      § 9.10   Occupational Health and Safety Program (OHSP) and biosafety requirements.

#### § § 9.10

      (a)  The sanctuary shall assure that an Occupational Health and Safety Program (OHSP) is developed and implemented in accordance with current veterinary medical practices and the guidelines and standards found in the  (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (a) of section 9.4);

      (b)  The sanctuary shall institute and administer an effective biosafety program that addresses the biosafety hazards at that particular site. The program shall include identifying biohazards, outlining practices and procedures to be followed, providing personal safety equipment or protective clothing and equipment, and establishing a description of the facility requirements for working with hazardous agents or materials. Policies and procedures must be implemented to avoid exposure to environmental and animal hazards. Biosafety must be included in the training program for all Sanctuary employees. In establishing a program, the Sanctuary must use current accepted practices and publications prepared by the CDC, NIH, and professional societies specializing in biosafety. The input and guidance of personnel trained or experienced in biosafety are essential. Complete records of both clinical and experimental agent exposure must accompany each chimpanzee sent to the sanctuary. The donating facility must also provide recent testing (for example, serology, virus culture, histology) so that the sanctuary staff is fully aware of the health condition of the arriving chimpanzee. The records may be created and retained in electronic form.

      § 9.11   Animal transport.

#### § § 9.11

      The transportation of chimpanzees by surface or air must be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Live Animal Regulations and guidelines, as applicable.

      § 9.12   Compliance with the Standards of Care, and USDA and PHS policies and regulations.

#### § § 9.12

      (a)  The federally supported chimpanzee sanctuary must comply with the standards of care set forth in this part and include a statement in the Annual Progress Report certifying compliance with these standards of care in accordance with the terms of the current contract between ORIP/DPCPSI and the Sanctuary Contractor. A designated representative of the Secretary will monitor compliance. The responsibility to monitor compliance with the standards is delegated to ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH/HHS . The ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH Project Officer for this contract will conduct scheduled site visits at least one time annually (or more often if necessary) and review monthly and quarterly reports submitted to the Project and Contract Officer. Subcontractors are subjected to the same provisions. Failure to comply with the standards set forth in this part, or to correct deficiencies noted within the allowable time period, could result in termination of the contract by the Federal Government (HHS/NIH), or allow the Secretary to correct the deficiencies according to the terms and conditions outlined in the contract. The Secretary may impose additional sanctions on the contractor up to, and including, authorizing assumption or reassignment of the management of the sanctuary contract.

      (b)  As noted in paragraph (a) of this section, the contractor for the sanctuary will be monitored on a regularly scheduled basis by representatives of ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH/HHS . The ORIP/DPCPSI representative will use facility site visits, reports, personal contact, and any other means as appropriate to ensure compliance with these standards. The contractor and subcontractors are required to obtain and maintain an Animal Welfare Assurance from NIH's Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) when chimpanzees are used for noninvasive studies as authorized in the CHIMP Act. In addition, the sanctuary must achieve accreditation by a nationally recognized animal program accrediting body (such as the AAALAC, the AZA, or similar recognized body) within a time frame to be determined by ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH . The federally supported sanctuary must comply with the requirements set forth in the Animal Welfare Regulations (9 CFR parts 1 through 3).

      Subpart B—340B Ceiling Price

        § 10.10   Ceiling price for a covered outpatient drug.

#### § § 10.10

        A manufacturer is required to calculate the 340B ceiling price for each covered outpatient drug, by National Drug Code (NDC) on a quarterly basis.

        (a)  The 340B ceiling price for a covered outpatient drug is equal to the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) from the preceding calendar quarter for the smallest unit of measure minus the Unit Rebate Amount (URA) and will be calculated using six decimal places. HRSA will publish the 340B ceiling price rounded to two decimal places.

        (b)  When the ceiling price calculation in paragraph (a) of this section results in an amount less than $0.01 the ceiling price will be $0.01.

        (c)  A manufacturer must estimate the 340B ceiling price for a new covered outpatient drug as of the date the drug is first available for sale. That estimation should be calculated as wholesale acquisition cost minus the appropriate rebate percentage until an AMP is available, which should occur no later than the 4th quarter that the drug is available for sale. Manufacturers are required to calculate the actual 340B ceiling price as described in paragraph (a) of this section and offer to refund or credit the covered entity the difference between the estimated 340B ceiling price and the actual 340B ceiling price within 120 days of the determination by the manufacturer that an overcharge occurred.

        § 10.11   Manufacturer civil monetary penalties.

#### § § 10.11

        (a)  Any manufacturer with a pharmaceutical pricing agreement that knowingly and intentionally charges a covered entity more than the ceiling price, as defined in § 10.10, for a covered outpatient drug, may be subject to a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each instance of overcharging, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. This penalty will be imposed pursuant to the applicable procedures at 42 CFR part 1003. Any civil monetary penalty assessed will be in addition to repayment for an instance of overcharging as required by section 340B(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHSA.

        (b)  An instance of overcharging is any order for a covered outpatient drug, by NDC, which results in a covered entity paying more than the ceiling price, as defined in § 10.10, for that covered outpatient drug.

        (1) Each order for an NDC will constitute a single instance, regardless of the number of units of each NDC ordered. This includes any order placed directly with a manufacturer or through a wholesaler, authorized distributor, or agent.

        (2) Manufacturers have an obligation to ensure that the 340B discount is provided through distribution arrangements made by the manufacturer.

        (3) An instance of overcharging is considered at the NDC level and may not be offset by other discounts provided on any other NDC or discounts provided on the same NDC on other transactions, orders, or purchases.

        (4) An instance of overcharging may occur at the time of initial purchase or when subsequent ceiling price recalculations due to pricing data submitted to CMS or new drug price estimations as defined in § 10.10(c) result in a covered entity paying more than the ceiling price due to failure or refusal to refund or credit a covered entity.

      Subpart C—Administrative Dispute Resolution

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 28657, Apr. 19, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

        § 10.20   340B Administrative Dispute Resolution Panel.

#### § § 10.20

        The Secretary shall appoint a roster of eligible individuals (Roster) consisting of staff within OPA, to serve on a 340B ADR Panel, as defined in § 10.3. The OPA Director, or the OPA Director's designee, shall select at least three members from the Roster to form a 340B ADR Panel to review and make decisions regarding one or more claims filed by covered entities or manufacturers.

        (a)  (1) The OPA Director shall:

        (i) Select at least three members for each 340B ADR Panel from the Roster of appointed staff;

        (ii) Have the authority to remove an individual from the 340B ADR Panel and replace such individual; and

        (iii) Select replacement 340B ADR Panel members should an individual resign from the panel or otherwise be unable to complete their duties.

        (2) No member of the 340B ADR Panel may have a conflict of interest, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  (1) All members appointed by the Secretary to the Roster of individuals eligible to be selected for a 340B ADR Panel will be screened for conflicts of interest prior to reviewing a claim. In determining whether a conflict exists, the OPA Director, in consultation with government ethics officials, will consider financial interest(s), current or former business or employment relationship(s), or other involvement of a prospective panel member or close family member who is either employed by or otherwise has a business relationship with an involved party, subsidiary of an involved party, or particular claim(s) expected to be presented to the prospective panel member.

        (2) All members of the 340B ADR Panel will undergo an additional screening prior to reviewing a specific claim to ensure that the 340B ADR Panel member was not directly involved in a decision concerning the specific issue of the ADR claim as it relates to the specific covered entity or manufacturer involved, including previous 340B ADR Panel decisions.

        (c)  The Secretary may remove any individual from the Roster of 340B ADR Panelists for any reason, including from any 340B ADR Panel to which the individual has already been assigned. The Secretary has the authority to review and reverse, alter, or uphold any 340B ADR Panel or reconsideration decision as outlined in §§ 10.23 and 10.24. Any such decision of the Secretary will serve as the final agency decision and will be binding upon the parties involved in the dispute, unless invalidated by an order of a Federal court.

        (d)  The 340B ADR Panel will:

        (1) Review and evaluate claims, including consolidated and joint claims, and documents and information submitted by (or on behalf of) covered entities and manufacturers;

        (2) Review and may request additional documentation, information, or clarification of an issue from any or all parties to make a decision (if the 340B ADR Panel finds that a party has failed to respond or fully respond to an information request, the 340B ADR Panel may proceed with facts that the 340B ADR Panel determines have been established in the proceeding);

        (3) Evaluate claims based on information received, unless, at the 340B ADR Panel's discretion, the nature of the claim necessitates that a meeting with the parties be held;

        (4) At its discretion, consult with others, including staff within OPA, other HHS offices, and other Federal agencies while reviewing a claim; and

        (5) Make decisions on each claim.

        § 10.21   Claims.

#### § § 10.21

        (a)  All claims must be specific to the parties identified in the claims and are limited to the following:

        (1) Claims by a covered entity that it has been overcharged by a manufacturer for a covered outpatient drug, including claims that a manufacturer has limited the covered entity's ability to purchase covered outpatient drugs at or below the 340B ceiling price; and

        (2) Claims by a manufacturer, after it has conducted an audit of a covered entity pursuant to section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act, that the covered entity has violated section 340B(a)(5)(A) of the PHS Act, regarding the prohibition of duplicate discounts, or section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the PHS Act, regarding the prohibition of the resale or transfer of covered outpatient drugs to a person who is not a patient of the covered entity.

        (b)  (1) Absent extenuating circumstances, a covered entity or manufacturer must file a claim under this section in writing to OPA within 3 years of the date of the alleged violation. Any file, document, or record associated with the claim that is the subject of a dispute must be maintained by the covered entity and manufacturer until the date of the final agency decision.

        (2) A covered entity filing a claim described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide the basis, including all available supporting documentation, for its belief that it has been overcharged by a manufacturer, in addition to any other documentation as may be requested by OPA. A covered entity claim against multiple manufacturers is not permitted.

        (3) A manufacturer filing a claim under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must provide documents sufficient to support its claim that a covered entity has violated the prohibition on diversion and/or duplicate discounts, in addition to any other documentation as may be requested by OPA.

        (4) A covered entity or manufacturer filing a claim must provide documentation of good faith efforts, including for example, documentation demonstrating that the initiating party has made attempts to contact the opposing party regarding the specific issues cited in the ADR claim.

        (c)  (1) Two or more covered entities may jointly file claims of overcharges by the same manufacturer for the same drug or drugs if each covered entity consents to the jointly filed claim and meets the filing requirements.

        (i) For covered entity joint claims, the claim must list each covered entity, its 340B ID and include documentation as described in paragraph (b) of this section, which demonstrates that each covered entity meets all of the requirements for filing the ADR claim.

        (ii) For covered entity joint claims, a letter requesting the combining of claims must accompany the claim at the time of filing and must document that each covered entity consents to the combining of the claims, including signatures of individuals representing each covered entity and a point of contact for each covered entity.

        (2) An association or organization may file on behalf of one or more covered entities representing their interests if:

        (i) Each covered entity is a member of the association or the organization representing it and each covered entity meets the requirements for filing a claim;

        (ii) The joint claim filed by the association or organization must assert overcharging by a single manufacturer for the same drug(s); and

        (iii) The claim includes a letter from the association or organization attesting that each covered entity agrees to the organization or association asserting a claim on its behalf, including a point of contact for each covered entity.

        (3) A manufacturer or manufacturers may request to consolidate claims brought by more than one manufacturer against the same covered entity if each manufacturer could individually file a claim against the covered entity, consents to the consolidated claim, meets the requirements for filing a claim, and the 340B ADR Panel determines that such consolidation is appropriate and consistent with the goals of fairness and economy of resources. Consolidated claims filed on behalf of manufacturers by associations or organizations representing their interests are not permitted.

        (d)  (1) Covered entities and manufacturers must file claims in writing with OPA, in the manner set forth by OPA.

        (2) OPA will conduct an initial review of all information submitted by the party filing the claim and will make a determination as to whether the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met. The OPA staff conducting the initial review of a claim may not be appointed to serve on the 340B ADR Panel reviewing that specific claim.

        (3) Additional information to substantiate a claim may be submitted by the initiating party and may be requested by OPA. If additional information is requested, the initiating party will have 20 business days from the receipt of OPA's request to respond. If the initiating party does not respond to a request for additional information within the specified time frame or request and receive an extension, the claim will not move forward to the 340B ADR Panel for review.

        (4) OPA will provide written notification to the initiating party that the claim is complete. Once the claim is complete, OPA will also provide written notification to the opposing party that the claim was submitted. This written notification will provide a copy of the initiating party's claim, and additional instructions regarding the 340B ADR process, including timelines and information on how to submit their response in accordance with the procedures for responding to a claim as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (5) If OPA finds that the claim meets the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section, and once OPA receives the opposing party's response in accordance with the procedures outlined in paragraph (e) of this section, additional written notification will be sent to both parties advising that the claim will be forwarded to the 340B ADR Panel for review.

        (6) If OPA finds that the claim does not meet the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section, written notification will be sent to both parties stating the reasons that the claim did not move forward.

        (7) For any claim that does not move forward for review by the 340B ADR Panel, the claim may be revised and refiled if there is new information to support the alleged statutory violation and the claim meets the criteria set forth in this section.

        (e)  (1) Upon receipt of notification by OPA that a claim is deemed complete and has met the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, the opposing party in alleged violation will have 30 business days to submit a written response to OPA.

        (2) A party may submit a request for an extension of the initial 30 business days response period and OPA will make a determination to approve or disapprove such request and notify both parties.

        (3) OPA will provide a copy of the opposing party's response to the initiating party and will notify both parties that the claim has moved forward for review by the 340B ADR Panel.

        (4) If an opposing party does not respond or elects not to participate in the 340B ADR process, OPA will notify both parties that the claim has moved forward for review by the 340B ADR Panel and the 340B ADR Panel will render its decision after review of the information submitted in the claim.

#### § § 10.22

        (a) To request information necessary to support its claim from an opposing party, a covered entity must submit a written request for additional information or documents to the 340B ADR Panel within 20 business days of the receipt from OPA that the claim was forwarded to the 340B ADR Panel for review. The 340B ADR Panel will review the information/document request and notify the covered entity if the request is not reasonable, not relevant or beyond the scope of the claim, and will permit the covered entity to resubmit a revised request if necessary.

        (b) The 340B ADR Panel will transmit the covered entity's information/document request to the manufacturer who must respond to the request within 20 business days of receipt of the request.

        (c) The manufacturer must fully respond, in writing, to an information/document request from the 340B ADR Panel by the response deadline.

        (1) A manufacturer is responsible for obtaining relevant information or documents from any wholesaler or other third party that may facilitate the sale or distribution of its drugs to covered entities.

        (2) If a manufacturer anticipates that it will not be able to respond to the information/document request by the deadline, it can request one extension by notifying the 340B ADR Panel in writing within 15 business days of receipt of the request.

        (3) A request to extend the deadline must include the reason why the specific deadline is not feasible and must outline the proposed timeline for fully responding to the information/document request.

        (4) The 340B ADR Panel may approve or disapprove the request for an extension of time and will notify all parties in writing of its decision.

        (5) If the 340B ADR Panel finds that a manufacturer has failed to fully respond to an information/document request, the 340B ADR Panel will proceed with the facts that the 340B ADR Panel has determined have been established in the proceeding.

        (6) If a manufacturer believes an information request to a covered entity is necessary for the 340B ADR Panel's review, it may make a request to the 340B ADR Panel to make the request to the covered entity.

        § 21.46   Merit roll.

#### § § 21.46

        Each board appointed pursuant to § 21.30 to consider the qualifications of candidates for appointment as officers shall assign a numerical rating to each candidate for appointment in the Regular Corps who passes the examination, and shall submit a report to the Surgeon General of the ratings and the relative standing of all such candidates for each grade in each profession or specialty within a profession. The Surgeon General shall submit each such report with his recommendations to the Secretary, and, if approved by the Secretary, the report shall constitute a merit roll from which the Secretary shall, in accordance with relative standing, recommend available persons to the President for nomination as commissioned officers of the Regular Corps. A board may consider any newly discovered evidence relating to the physical, professional, or personal qualifications of any candidate examined for appointment. Upon recommendation of such board after review of such evidence, the Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary, may correct the rating of a candidate or may qualify or disqualify a candidate. The placing of a candidate's name on a merit roll shall give no assurance of an appointment. A merit roll shall expire when a new merit roll in the same profession or specialty within a profession and grade has been established, but no merit roll shall continue in effect longer than two years after its approval by the Secretary. Every candidate who has not been nominated by the President for appointment prior to the expiration of a merit roll on which his name appears, shall, unless he requests the opportunity to be reexamined, be rated with the next group of candidates of the same profession or specialty within a profession for appointment in the same grade and shall be given the same rating he had on the expired merit roll. If two candidates who were examined at the same time receive the same numerical rating the elder candidate shall assume relative standing on the merit roll over the younger candidate. If a candidate whose name is being transferred from an expired to a new merit roll has the same numerical rating as a candidate whose name is being placed on the new merit roll for the first time, the former shall assume relative standing on the merit roll over the latter. The name of a candidate may be removed from a merit roll in the event that he refuses an appointment when offered. No candidate's eligibility for appointment shall exceed two years unless he again becomes eligible as the result of another examination.

        § 21.47   Examination; anticipation of meeting qualifications.

#### § § 21.47

        A potential candidate for appointment in any grade in the Regular Corps may be examined within a period of nine months prior to the date upon which it is anticipated that he will qualify for appointment under this subpart. Upon successful completion of the examination, his name will be entered on a merit roll. In the event that his name, in order of relative standing among all candidates, precedes that of fully qualified candidates, his name, for purpose of appointment, shall be passed over in favor of fully qualified candidates until such time as he becomes fully qualified, but in no event shall he otherwise lose his relative standing on the merit roll, except as provided in § 21.46. If the candidate fails to qualify for appointment at the time that it was anticipated that he would qualify, his name shall be removed from the merit roll.

        § 21.51   Appointment of officers having specialized training or experience in administration and management.

#### § § 21.51

        The Surgeon General may recommend for original appointment in the Reserve Corps candidates who have specialized training or experience in administration and management relating to the functions of the Service. All such candidates shall be subject to the same eligibility requirements for original appointment as are applicable to other candidates, except that such a candidate may substitute experience in administration or management for the requirement of professional training or experience.

        § 21.52   Waiver of entrance qualifications for original appointment in time of war or national emergency.

#### § § 21.52

        If, in time of war or national emergency proclaimed by the President, the Secretary determines that there is need for commissioned personnel to meet the needs of the Service, other than persons eligible for examination for original appointment under the eligibility requirements prescribed in this subpart, he may prescribe standards of eligibility for examination for the original appointment of officers in the Reserve Corps without regard to such eligibility requirements. Such standards shall, however, authorize the examination only of candidates with specialized experience in administration or management or candidates with training or experience in fields relating to public health. The permanent grade of an officer who becomes eligible for examination for appointment pursuant to such standards and who becomes eligible for appointment after passage of an examination shall be limited to the junior assistant or the assistant grade, except that, if upon examination a candidate is found to be exceptionally qualified for the performance of highly specialized duties with the Service pursuant to § 21.55, he may be recommended for appointment to any grade up to and including the director grade.

> [21 FR 9806, Dec. 12, 1956, as amended at 24 FR 1790, Mar. 12, 1959]

        § 21.53   Examination.

#### § § 21.53

        The examination of candidates for original appointment as officers to any grade in the Reserve Corps shall consist of a review and evaluation of their academic and other education and their training and experience. In the discretion of the Surgeon General the examination of any such candidate may include an oral interview, a written examination, or both.

        § 21.54   Students.

#### § § 21.54

        A potential candidate for appointment in the Regular Corps who is pursuing a course of instruction which, upon completion, would qualify him under § 21.25 or § 21.26 for examination for appointment in the junior assistant or assistant grade may be examined for and appointed in the Reserve Corps in the junior assistant grade but shall not be called to extended active duty until the successful completion of such course of instruction, except that: (a) He may be called to active duty for purposes of training for periods not to exceed 120 days during any fiscal year, and (b) those students who have completed at least 3 years of collegiate or professional study leading to the qualifying degree for appointment may be called to active duty for the purpose of completing the requirements of § 21.25(a)(3). An appointment made under this subpart shall be terminated upon the officer's failure to continue a full-time course of study or failure to meet the requirements of § 21.25(a)(3) within 18 months after entering on active duty.

        § 21.55   Appointment to higher grades; candidates exceptionally qualified in specialized fields.

#### § § 21.55

        Any candidate eligible for examination for appointment in the grade of assistant pursuant to § 21.26 who, upon examination for such purpose, is found exceptionally qualified for the performance of duties requiring highly specialized training or experience may be recommended for appointment in the Reserve Corps in any grade up to and including the director grade without regard to the additional years of postgraduate training or experience prescribed for grades above the assistant grade.

        § 21.56   Reappointment.

#### § § 21.56

        An officer of the Reserve Corps, after being examined and found qualified for reappointment, may be recommended for reappointment to the same grade in the event that his commission expires before he becomes eligible for reappointment to a higher grade, or may be recommended for reappointment to a higher grade to be effective on or after the date on which he meets the qualifications prescribed in this subpart for original appointment to such higher grade.

        § 21.57   Examination for reappointment.

#### § § 21.57

        The examination of an officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty who is being considered for reappointment in such corps shall consist of a review and evaluation of his record with the Service. The examination of an officer of the Reserve Corps on inactive duty who is being considered for reappointment in such corps shall consist of (a) a review and evaluation of his record with the Service while on active duty, if any, and (b) the record of his training or experience during the period of his inactive duty preceding such examination. In the discretion of the Surgeon General the examination for reappointment of an officer, whether on active or inactive duty, may include an oral interview.

        § 21.58   Physical examination for reappointment.

#### § § 21.58

        Every officer of the Reserve Corps being considered for reappointment shall undergo such physical examination as the Surgeon General may direct. An officer on active duty may be recommended for reappointment unless he is found to have a physical disability which is determined to render him physically unfit to perform the duties of his office under section 402 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as amended. An officer may be recommended for promotion only if he meets the physical qualifications for original appointment. If an officer is not available to be physically examined because of circumstances which make it impracticable for the Service to require such examination, he may, in the discretion of the Surgeon General, be reappointed without such examination, but shall be examined as soon thereafter as practicable and his physical qualification or disqualification for continued or future active service shall be determined on the same basis as if the physical examination had been given prior to reappointment.

        § 21.73   Policy.

#### § § 21.73

        (a) It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to withhold allotments from pay and allowances of commissioned officers on active duty in the Service to make involuntary allotments from pay and allowances as payment of child, or child and spousal, support payments when the officer has failed to make periodic payments under a support order in a total amount equal to the support payable for two months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by notice from an authorized person to the designated official of the Department. Such notice shall specify the name and address of the payee to whom the allotment is payable. The amount of the allotment shall be the amount necessary to comply with the support order including amounts for arrearages as well as for current support. However the amount of the allotment, when added to any other amounts withheld from the officer's pay pursuant to a support order, shall not exceed the limits for involuntary allotments from pay as prescribed in section 303 (b) and (c) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1673. An allotment under this Subpart shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from any authorized person.

        (b) Notwithstanding the above, no action shall be taken to withhold an allotment from the pay and allowances of any officer until such officer has had an opportunity to consult with a legal officer of the Department to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the officer's support obligation and his or her failure to make payments. The Department shall exercise continuing good faith efforts to arrange such a consultation, but must begin to withhold allotments on the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed since notice of an opportunity to consult was sent to the officer.

        § 21.74   Responsibilities.

#### § § 21.74

        (a) The General Counsel, Office of the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, shall be the Designated Official for the Department and shall provide guidance to the Service regarding administration of the provisions of these regulations.

        (b) The Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, Office of Personnel Management, Office of Management, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, shall implement the provisions of these regulations.

        § 21.75   Procedures.

#### § § 21.75

        (a)  (1) An authorized person shall serve on the designated official of the Department a signed notice including:

        (i) Full name of the officer;

        (ii) Social security number of the officer;

        (iii) Duty station location of the officer, if known;

        (iv) A statement that support payments are delinquent by an amount at least equal to the amount of support payable for two months;

        (v) A photocopy, along with any modifications, of the underlying support order;

        (vi) A statement of the amount of arrearages provided for in the court order and the amount which is to be applied each month toward liquidation of the arrearages, if applicable;

        (vii) The full name and address of the payee to whom the allotment will be payable;

        (viii) Any limitations on the duration of the support allotment.

        (3) Valid service is not accomplished until the notice is received in the office of the designated official.

        (4) If the order of a court or duly authorized administrative agency seeks collection of arrearages, the notice must state that the support allotment qualifies for the additional 5 percent in excess of the maximum percentage limitations found in 15 U.S.C. 1673. Supporting evidence must be submitted to the Department establishing that the support order is 12 or more weeks in arrears.

        (5) When the information submitted is not sufficient to identify the officer the notice shall be returned directly to the authorized person with an explanation of the deficiency. However, before returning the notice, an attempt should be made to inform the authorized person who caused the notice to be served that it will not be honored unless adequate information is supplied.

        (6) Upon proper service of notice of delinquent support payments and together with all required supplementary documents and information, the Service shall identify the officer from whom moneys are due and payable. The pay of the officer shall be reduced by the amount necessary to comply with the support order and liquidate arrearages if any, if provided by order of a court or duly authorized administrative agency. The maximum amount to be alloted under the provision together with any other moneys withheld from the officer for support pursuant to a court order may not exceed:

        (i) 50 percent of the officer's disposable earnings for any month when the officer asserts by affidavit or other acceptable evidence that he or she is supporting a spouse or dependent child or both, other than a party in the support order. When the officer submits evidence, copies shall be sent to the authorized person, together with notification that the officer's support claim will be honored. If the support claim is contested by the authorized person, the authorized person may refer it to the appropriate court or other authority for resolution. Pending resolution of a contested support claim, the allotment shall be made but the amount of such allotment may not exceed 50 percent of the officer's disposable earnings;

        (ii) 60 percent of the officer's disposable earnings for any month when the officer fails to assert by affidavit or other acceptable evidence, that he or she is supporting a spouse or dependent child or both;

        (iii) Regardless of the limitations above, an additional five percent of the officer's disposable earnings shall be withheld when it is stated in the notice that the officer is in arrears in an amount equivalent to 12 or more weeks' support.

        (b)  (1) The following moneys, as defined in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, are subject to inclusion in computation of the officer's disposable earnings:

        (vii) Family separation allowances (only for officers assigned outside the contiguous United States).

        (c)  The following moneys are excluded from the computation of the officer's disposable earnings. Amounts due from or payable by the United States shall be offset by any amounts:

        (1) Owed by the officer to the United States.

        (ii) FICA.

        (3) Properly withheld for Federal and State income tax purposes if the withholding of the amounts is authorized or required by law and if amounts withheld are not greater than would be the case if the individual claimed all dependents to which he or she were entitled. The withholding of additional amounts pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3402(i) may be permitted only when the officer presents evidence of a tax obligation which supports the additional withholding.

        (4) Deducted for the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance coverage.

        (5) Advances of pay that may be due and payable by the officer in the future.

        (d)  (1) As soon as possible, but not later than 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of notice, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall send to the officer at his or her duty station, written notice:

        (i) That notice has been served, including a copy of the documents submitted;

        (ii) Of the maximum limitations set forth, with a request that the officer submit supporting affidavits or other documentation necessary for determining the applicable percentage limitation;

        (iii) That by submitting supporting affidavits or other necessary documentation, the officer consents to the disclosure of such information to the party requesting the support allotment;

        (iv) Of the amount of percentage that will be deducted if the officer fails to submit the documentation necessary to enable the designated official of the Service to respond to the legal process within the time limits set forth;

        (v) That a consultation with a legal officer is authorized and will be provided by the Department. The name, address, and telephone number of the legal officer will be provided;

        (vi) That the officer may waive the personal consultation with a legal officer; however if consultation is waived action will be taken to initiate the allotment by the first end-of-month payday after notification is received that the officer has waived his/her consultation;

        (vii) That the allotment will be initiated without the officer having received a personal consultation with a legal officer if the legal officer provides documentation that consultation could not be arranged even though good faith attempts to do so had been made; and

        (viii) Of the date that the allotment is scheduled to begin.

        (2) The Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall inform the appropriate legal officer of the need for consultation with the officer and shall provide the legal officer with a copy of the notice and other legal documentation served on the designated official.

        (3) If possible, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall provide the officer with the following:

        (i) A consultation in person with the appropriate legal officer to discuss the legal and other factors involved with the officer's support obligation and his/her failures to make payment;

        (ii) Copies of any other documents submitted with the notice.

        (4) The legal officer concerned will confirm in writing to the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division within 30 days of notice that the officer received a consultation concerning the officer's support obligation and the consequences of failure to make payments. The legal officer concerned must advise the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division of the inability to arrange such consultation and the status of continuing efforts to contact the officer.

        (e)  (1) When notice is served and the identified officer is found not to be entitled to any moneys due from or payable by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall return the notice to the authorized person, and advise in writing that no moneys are due from or payable by the Department of Health and Human Services to the named individual.

        (2) Where it appears that moneys are only temporarily exhausted or otherwise unavailable, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall advise the authorized person in writing on a timely basis as to why, and for how long, the moneys will be unavailable.

        (3) In instances where the officer separates from active duty, the authorized person shall be informed in writing on a timely basis that the allotment is discontinued.

        (f)  Allotments shall be withheld beginning on the first end-of-month payday after the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division is notified that the officer has had a consultation with a legal officer, has waived his/her right to such consultation, or the legal officer has submitted documentation that a consultation with the officer could not be arranged after good faith attempts to do so were made by the legal officer. The Service shall not be required to vary its normal allotment payment cycle to comply with the notice.

        § 23.8   What operational requirements apply to an entity to which National Health Service Corps personnel are assigned?

#### § § 23.8

        Each National Health Service Corps site must:

        (a) Operate a health care delivery system within a planned or existing community structure to assure:

        (1) The provision of high quality comprehensive health care;

        (2) To the extent feasible, full professional health care coverage for the health manpower shortage area;

        (3) Continuum of care; and

        (4) The availability and accessibility of secondary and tertiary health care (the two more sophisticated levels of health care beyond primary care);

        (b) Establish and maintain a patient record system;

        (c) Implement a system for maintaining the confidentiality of patient records;

        (g) Establish basic data, cost accounting, and management information and reporting systems as prescribed by the Secretary.

        § 23.9   What must an entity to which National Health Service Corps personnel are assigned (, a National Health Service Corps site) charge for the provision of health services by assigned personnel?

#### § § 23.9

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, individuals receiving services from assigned National Health Service Corps personnel must be charged on a fee-for-service or other basis at a rate which is computed to permit recovery of the value of the services and is approved by the Secretary.

        (b) In determining whether to approve fees to be charged for health services, the Secretary will consider: The costs to the National Health Service Corps of providing the health services; the costs to the health manpower shortage area for providing the services; and the charges for similar services by other practitioners or facilities in or nearby the health manpower shortage area. However, if assigned National Health Service Corps personnel are providing services within the framework of an established health services delivery system, the Secretary may approve the fees charged under that system without regard to the foregoing factors.

        (c)(1) No charge or a nominal charge will be made for health services provided by assigned National Health Service Corps personnel to individuals within the health manpower shortage area with annual incomes at or below the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the  by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). However, no individual will be denied health services based upon inability to pay for the services. Any individual who has an annual income above the poverty guidelines but whose income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty guidelines, will receive health services at a nominal charge. However, charges will be made for services to the extent that payment will be made by a third party which is authorized or under legal obligation to pay the charges.

        (2) The provisions of this paragraph also apply with respect to services provided by an individual who is fulfilling an NHSC scholarship obligation under section 753 or who received a special grant under section 755.

        § 23.10   Under what circumstances may a National Health Service Corps site's reimbursement obligation to the Federal Government be waived?

#### § § 23.10

        (a) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act if he determines that:

        (1) The National Health Service Corps site is financially unable to meet the reimbursement requirements or that compliance with those requirements will unreasonably limit the ability of the site to adequately support the provision of services by assigned Corps personnel. In making these determinations, the Secretary will consider—

        (i) The costs necessary to adequately support the health services provided by the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel and the income and financial resources available to meet the costs;

        (ii) The ability of the applicant to obtain credit from suppliers, lending institutions, private organizations and individuals;

        (iii) The need of the health manpower shortage area for health services; and

        (iv) The extent to which the National Health Service Corps site utilizes health professions personnel.

        (2) A significant percentage of the individuals who are located in the health manpower shortage area and are receiving the health services of the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel are elderly, living in poverty, or have other characteristics which indicate an inability to pay. For purposes of this section, “elderly” means persons 65 years or older and the “CSA Income Poverty Guidelines” will be used as the standard for determining whether individuals are living in poverty. Other characteristics indicating inability to pay include, but are not to be limited to, the ratio of unemployment in the health manpower shortage area and the area's cost-of-living index.

        (b) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act if he or she determines that the National Health Service Corps site is a small health center (as defined by section 334(f)(5) of the Act) that needs all or part of the amount otherwise payable to—

        (1) Expand or improve its provision of health services;

        (2) Increase the number of individuals served;

        (3) Renovate or modernize facilities for its provision of health services;

        (4) Improve the administration of its health service programs; or

        (5) Establish a financial reserve to assure its ability to continue providing health services;

        (c) Where the Secretary determines that a National Health Service Corps site is eligible for a waiver under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. the Secretary may waive the application of the reimbursement requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act and apply the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act. The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) for such a site if he or she determines that the National Health Service Corps site meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Funds retained by a National Health Service Corps site as a result of such waiver must be used for the purposes set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section.

        (d) Requests for a prospective or retrospective waiver must be made at the time and in the manner and contain the documentation prescribed by the Secretary.

        § 23.11   Under what circumstances may the Secretary sell equipment or other property of the United States used by the National Health Service Corps site?

#### § § 23.11

        (a) Upon expiration of the assignment of all Corps personnel to a health manpower shortage area, the Secretary may sell equipment and other property of the United States used by the assigned personnel. The equipment may be sold at the fair market value or less than the fair market value to any entity providing health services in or to a health manpower shortage area if the Secretary determines that an entity is unable to pay the fair market value. In determining whether an entity is financially unable to purchase equipment or property at fair market value, the Secretary will consider (1) the present financial resources of the entity available to purchase the equipment or property based upon its current liabilities, and (2) the entity's ability to obtain the funds necessary to purchase the equipment or property. However, the Secretary will not sell the equipment or property for less than fair market value to a profitmaking organization unless the organization gives reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property to provide health services in or to the health manpower shortage area.

        (b) The Secretary will give priority to sales to an entity providing reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property for the purpose of retaining within the health manpower shortage area National Health Service Corps personnel who have completed their assignments.

        § 23.12   Who will supervise and control the assigned personnel?

#### § § 23.12

        Assigned National Health Service Corps personnel will at all times remain under the direct supervision and control of the Secretary. Observance of institutional rules and regulations by the assigned personnel is a mere incident of the performance of their Federal functions and does not alter their direct professional and administrative responsibility to the Secretary.

        § 23.13   What nondiscrimination requirements apply to National Health Service Corps sites?

#### § § 23.13

        National Health Service Corps sites are advised that in addition to complying with the terms and conditions of this regulation, the following laws and regulations are applicable—

        (a) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (43 U.S.C. 2000d ) and its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 80 (prohibiting discrimination in federally assisted programs on the grounds of race, color, or national origin); and

        (b) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 84 (prohibiting discrimination in federally assisted programs on the basis of handicap).

        (c) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101  and its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 91 (prohibiting nondiscrimination on the basis of age in HHS programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance).

No patient shall be discharged or transferred on account of noncompliance if to do so would seriously endanger his life or health, nor shall any patient be discharged if his failure to comply is due, in the opinion of the officer in charge, to a mental disease or disorder.

        (b) If the discharge or transfer of a patient is likely to endanger the health of persons other than the patient or officers or employees of the station or hospital, the officer in charge shall give advance notice to appropriate State, county, or municipal authorities of the discharge or transfer.

          (a) Miners must be disrobed from the waist up at the time the radiograph is given. The facility must provide a private dressing area and for those miners who wish to use one, the facility must provide a clean gown. Facilities must be heated to a comfortable temperature.

          (b) Every digital chest radiograph taken as required under this section must be a single posteroanterior projection at full inspiration on a digital detector with sensor area being no less than 1505 cm square centimeters with a minimum width of 35cm. The imaging plate must have a maximum pixel pitch of 200µm, with a minimum bit depth of 10. Spatial resolution must be at least 2.5 line pairs per millimeter. The storage phosphor cassette or digital image detector must be positioned either vertically or horizontally so that the image includes the apices and costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs. If the detector cannot include the apices and costophrenic angles of both lungs as described, then two side-by-side images can be obtained that together include the apices and the costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs.

          (c) Chest radiographs of miners under this section must be performed:

          (1) By or under the supervision of a physician who makes chest radiographs in the normal course of practice and who has demonstrated ability to make chest radiographs of a quality to best ascertain the presence of pneumoconiosis; or

          (2) By a radiologic technologist as defined in § 37.2.

          (d) Radiographs must be made with a diagnostic X-ray machine with a maximum actual (not nominal) source (focal spot) of 2 mm, as measured in two orthogonal directions.

          (e) Radiographs must be made with units having generators which have a minimum rating of 300 mA at 125 kVp. Exposure kilovoltage must be at least the minimum as recommended by the manufacturer for chest radiography.

          (f) An electric power supply must be used that complies with the voltage, current, and regulation specified by the manufacturer of the machine. If the manufacturer or installer of the radiographic equipment recommends equipment for control of electrical power fluctuations, such equipment must be used as recommended.

          (g) Radiographs must be obtained only with equipment having a beam-limiting device that does not cause large unexposed boundaries. The beam limiting device must provide rectangular collimation. Electronic post-image acquisition “shutters” available on some CR and DR systems that limit the size of the final image and that simulate collimator limits must not be used. The use and effect of the beam limiting device must be discernible on the resulting image.

          (h) Radiographic technique charts must be used that are developed specifically for the X-ray system and detector combinations used, indicating exposure parameters by anatomic measurements.

          (1) If automated exposure control devices are used, performance must be documented by a medical physicist utilizing the image capture systems and exposure parameters used at the facility for chest imaging, using methods recommended in AAPM Report No. 74, pages 17-18, and in AAPM Report No. 14, pages 61-62 (incorporated by reference, see § 37.10).

          (2) Exposure parameters achieved during the evaluation of the automated exposure system must be recorded by the medical physicist in a written report or electronic file that is stored at the facility and available for inspection by NIOSH for a minimum of 5 years after the miner's examination.

          (i) To ensure high quality digital chest radiographs:

          (1) The maximum exposure time must not exceed 50 milliseconds except for subjects with chests over 28 centimeters posteroanterior, for whom the exposure time must not exceed 100 milliseconds;

          (2) The distance from source or focal spot to detector must be at least 70 inches (or 180 centimeters if measured in centimeters);

          (3) The exposure setting for chest images must be within the range of 100-300 equivalent exposure speeds and must comply with ACR Practice Guideline for Diagnostic Reference Levels in Medical X-Ray Imaging, Section V—Diagnostic Reference Levels For Imaging With Ionizing Radiation and Section VII—Radiation Safety in Imaging (incorporated by reference, see § 37.10). Radiation exposures should be periodically measured and patient radiation doses estimated by the medical physicist to assure doses are as low as reasonably achievable.

          (4) Digital radiography system performance, including resolution, modulation transfer function (MTF), image signal-to-noise and detective quantum efficiency must be evaluated and judged acceptable by a qualified medical physicist using the specifications in AAPM Report No. 93, pages 1-68 (incorporated by reference, see § 37.10). Image management software and settings for routine chest imaging must be used, including routine amplification of digital detector signal as well as standard image post-processing functions. Image or edge enhancement software functions must not be employed unless they are integral to the digital radiography system (not elective); in such cases, only the minimum image enhancement permitted by the system may be employed.

          (5)(i) The image object, transmission and associated data storage, file format, and transmission of associated information must conform to the following components of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard (incorporated by reference, see § 37.10):

          § 37.53   Method of obtaining definitive chest radiograph classifications.

#### § § 37.53

          (a) All chest radiographs which are first classified by an A or B Reader will be submitted by NIOSH to a B Reader qualified pursuant to § 37.52.

          (1) If there is agreement between the two classifications, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the result will be considered final and reported to MSHA for transmittal to the miner.

          (2) When agreement is lacking, NIOSH must obtain a third classification from the panel of B Readers.

          (i) If any two of the three classifications demonstrate agreement, the result must be considered the final determination.

          (ii) If agreement is lacking among the three classifications, NIOSH will obtain independent classifications from two additional B Readers selected from the panel, and the final determination will be the median category derived from the total of five classifications.

          (b) Two classifications are considered to be in agreement when:

          (1) They are derived from complete classifications recorded using approved paper or electronic versions of the Chest Radiograph Classification Form (CDC/NIOSH 2.8) and received by NIOSH; and

          (2) Both find either stage A, B, or C complicated pneumoconiosis; or,

          (3) For simple pneumoconiosis, are both in the same major category or are within one minor category (ILO Classification 12-point scale) of each other (subject to the exception in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section).

          (i) The higher of the two classifications must be reported.

          (ii) The only exception to the one minor category principle is a reading sequence of 0/1, 1/0 or 1/0, 0/1, which are not considered agreement.

          § 37.54   Notification of abnormal radiographic findings.

#### § § 37.54

          (a)  The first physician to interpret the radiograph must communicate findings of, or findings suggesting, abnormality of cardiac shape or size, tuberculosis, lung cancer, or any other significant abnormal findings other than pneumoconiosis to the miner indicated on the Miner Identification Document or to the miner's designated physician. A notice of the communication must be submitted to NIOSH. When significant abnormal findings are reported, NIOSH will also notify the miner to contact his or her physician.

          (b)  When NIOSH has more than one radiograph of a miner in its files and the most recent examination was found by the first physician to interpret the radiograph or subsequently by NIOSH B Readers to show an abnormality of cardiac shape or size, tuberculosis, cancer, complicated pneumoconiosis, and any other significant abnormal findings, NIOSH will arrange for a licensed physician to compare the most recent image to older images and NIOSH will inform the miner of any significant changes or progression of disease or other findings.

          (c)  All final determinations of radiographic classifications providing evidence for development of pneumoconiosis will be reported to the miner or to the miner's designated physician by NIOSH. In addition, NIOSH will coordinate with MSHA to assure that such miners are notified of eligibility to transfer to a less dusty area, in accordance with section 203 of the Act ( 30 CFR part 90 and § 37.102).

          (d)  NIOSH will make every reasonable effort to process the findings described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of receipt of the information described in § 37.60 in a complete and acceptable form.

          (1) NIOSH will coordinate with MSHA to provide notice of eligibility for the part 90 transfer option within the same time frame.

          (2) The results of an examination may not be processed by NIOSH if the examination was made within 6 months of the date of a previous acceptable examination.

          § 37.60   Submitting required chest radiograph classification and miner identification documents.

#### § § 37.60

          (a) Each chest radiograph required to be made under this subpart, together with the completed Chest Radiograph Classification Form and the completed Miner Identification Document, must be submitted together for each miner to NIOSH within 14 calendar days after the radiographic examination is given. All submitted items become the property of NIOSH.

          (1) When the radiograph is digital, the image file for each radiograph, together with either hard copy or electronic versions of the completed Chest Radiograph Classification Form and the completed Miner Identification Document, must be submitted to NIOSH using the software and format specified by NIOSH either using portable electronic media, or a secure electronic file transfer.

          (2) NIOSH will notify the submitting facility when it has received the image files and forms from the examination. After this notification, the facility will permanently delete, or if this is not technologically feasible for the imaging system used, render permanently inaccessible all files and forms from its electronic and physical files.

          (b) If NIOSH deems any submission under paragraph (a) of this section inadequate, the operator will be notified of the deficiency. The operator must promptly make appropriate arrangements for the necessary reexamination at no expense to the miner.

          (c) Failure to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section will be cause to revoke approval of a plan or any other approval as may be appropriate. An approval that has been revoked may be reinstated at the discretion of NIOSH after it receives satisfactory assurances and evidence that all deficiencies have been corrected and that effective controls have been instituted to prevent a recurrence.

          (d) Chest radiographs and other required documents must be submitted only for miners.

          (e) If a miner refuses to participate in all phases of the examination prescribed in this subpart, no report need be made. If a miner refuses to participate in any phase of the examination prescribed in this subpart, all forms must be submitted with his or her name and the last four digits of the Social Security number on each. If any form cannot be completed because of the miner's refusal, it must be marked “Miner Refuses,” and submitted to NIOSH. No submission will be made, however, without a completed Miner Identification Document (CDC/NIOSH 2.9) containing the miner's name, address, last four digits of the Social Security number and place of employment.

#### § § 37.2

        Any term defined in the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 801 , Pub. L. 95-164, as amended) and not defined below will have the meaning given it in the Act. As used in this subpart:

        means the Federal Mine Safety and Health _Act_ of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 801, , Pub. L. 95-164, as amended).

        means a physician certified by NIOSH as able to classify chest radiographs using the ILO Classification system, pursuant to § 37.52(b).

        means a single posteroanterior radiographic projection or radiograph of the chest at full inspiration recorded on either film or digital radiography systems.

        means that an examination conducted pursuant to this part must be given at a reasonable hour in the locality in which the miner resides or a location that is equally accessible to the miner. For example, examinations at the mine during, immediately preceding, or immediately following work and a “no appointment” examination at a medical facility in a community easily accessible to the residences of a majority of the miners working at the mine will be considered of equivalent convenience for purposes of this definition.

        as used in this context, include both Digital Radiography (DR) and Computed Radiography (CR) systems.

        (1)  is the term for digital radiographic image acquisition systems that detect radiographic signals using a cassette-based photostimulable storage phosphor. Subsequently, the cassette is processed using a stimulating laser beam to convert the latent radiographic image to electronic signals which are then processed and stored so they can be displayed.

        (2)  is the term used for digital radiographic image acquisition systems in which the radiographic signals received by the image detector are converted nearly instantaneously to electronic signals without movable cassettes.

        means a facility or organization licensed to provide health care by the State or Territory in which services are provided, such as a hospital, a clinic, or other provider that performs medical examinations.

        means the classification of radiographs using the International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses, a system devised by an international committee of the International Labour Office (ILO), including a complete set of standard film radiographs or digital chest image files available from the ILO or other set of chest image files approved by NIOSH as equivalent. The _ILO Classification_ is incorporated by reference into §§ 37.50(a) and (c) and 37.51(b).

        means the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Department of Labor.

        means any individual working in a coal or other mine.

        means the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (_NIOSH_), located within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Within NIOSH, the Respiratory Health Division (RHD), 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, is the organizational unit that has programmatic responsibility for the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program.

        means employees of CDC/NIOSH and employees of CDC contractors.

        means any owner, lessee, or other person who operates, controls, or supervises a coal or other mine or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine.

        means the group of physicians that are currently certified by NIOSH as B Readers and who classify or otherwise evaluate radiographs for the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program.

        means any medical examination that includes a chest radiographic examination given in accordance with the specifications of this Part to a person not previously employed by the same operator.

        § 37.3   Chest radiographs required for miners.

#### § § 37.3

        (a)  Every operator must provide to each miner who is employed in or at any of its coal mines and who was employed in coal mining prior to December 30, 1969, or who has completed the required examinations under paragraph (b) of this section an opportunity for a chest radiograph at no cost to the miner in accordance with this subpart:

        (1) NIOSH will notify the operator of each coal mine of a period within which the operator may provide examinations to each miner employed at its coal mine. The period must begin no sooner than 3.5 years and end no later than 4.5 years subsequent to the ending date of the previous 6-month period specified for a coal mine either by the operator on an approved plan or by NIOSH if the operator did not submit an approved plan. Within the period specified for each mine, the operator may select a 6-month period within which to provide examinations in accordance with a plan approved under § 37.101.

        (2) Within either the next or future period(s) specified to the operator for each of its coal mines, the operator of the coal mine may select a different 6-month period for each of its mines within which to offer examinations. In the event the operator does not submit an approved plan, NIOSH will specify a 6-month period to the operator within which miners must have the opportunity for examinations.

        (b)  Every operator must provide to each miner who begins working in or at an underground coal mine for the first time after December 30, 1969 or in or at a surface coal mine for the first time after August 1, 2014:

        (1) An initial chest radiograph, as soon as possible, but in no event later than 30 days after commencement of employment or within 30 days of approval of a plan to provide chest radiographs. An initial chest radiograph given to a miner according to former regulations for this subpart prior to August 1, 2014 will also be considered as fulfilling this requirement.

        (2) A second chest radiograph, in accordance with this subpart, 3 years following the initial examination if the miner is still engaged in coal mining. A second radiograph given to a miner according to former regulations under this subpart prior to August 1, 2014 will be considered as fulfilling this requirement.

        (3) A third chest radiograph 2 years following the second chest radiograph if the miner is still engaged in coal mining and if the second radiograph shows evidence of category 1 (1/0, 1/1, 1/2), category 2 (2/1, 2/2, 2/3), category 3 (3/2, 3/3, 3/+) simple pneumoconiosis, or complicated pneumoconiosis (ILO Classification) or if the second spirometry examination specified in § 37.92(b)(2) shows evidence of decreased lung function to the extent specified in § 37.92(b)(3).

        (c)  NIOSH will notify the miner when he or she is due to receive the second or third mandatory examination under paragraph (b) of this section. NIOSH will notify the coal mine operator when the miner is to be given a second examination.

        (1) The operator will be notified of a miner's third examination only with the miner's written consent. The notice to the operator will not state the medical reason for the examination or that it is the third examination in the series.

        (2) If the miner is notified by NIOSH that the third mandatory examination is due and the operator is not so notified, availability of the radiographic examination under the NIOSH-approved operator's plan will constitute the operator's compliance with the requirement to provide a third mandatory examination even if the miner refuses to take the examination.

        (d)  The opportunity for chest radiographs to be made available by an operator for purposes of this subpart must be provided in accordance with a plan that has been submitted and approved in accordance with this part.

#### § § 37.93

        (a)  Facilities seeking approval to provide the spirometry testing specified under this subpart must have the ability to provide spirometry of high technical quality. Thus, NIOSH-approved facilities must meet the requirements specified in this subpart for the following activities: Training of technicians who perform the tests; conducting spirometry tests using equipment and procedures that meet required specifications; collecting the respiratory assessment form; transmitting data to NIOSH; and communicating with miners as required for scheduling, testing, and notification of results. Facilities seeking approval may apply to NIOSH using the Spirometry Facility Certification document (CDC/NIOSH 2.14).

        (b)  A spirometry quality assurance program must be in place to minimize the rate of invalid test results. This program must include all of the following components:

        (1)  Testing personnel must fully comply with the 2005 ATS/ERS Standardisation of Spirometry guidelines for instrument calibration check procedures, pp. 322-323, including Table 3 (incorporated by reference,  § 37.98).

        (i) For volume spirometers, calibration check procedures must include daily (day of testing) leak and volume accuracy checks. In addition, volume linearity checks must be performed according to the frequency established by the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines.

        (ii) For flow-type spirometers, calibration must be checked daily by injecting 3 liters of air from a calibration syringe at 3 different speeds (fast, medium, slow). Flow linearity must be checked weekly as established by the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines.

        (iii) Instrument calibration check records must be maintained by the facility and available for inspection by NIOSH, as deemed necessary.

        (2)  The spirometer software must automatically perform quality assurance checks on expiratory maneuvers during each spirometry testing session. Screen displayed error messages must alert the technician to maneuver acceptability and test session non-repeatability. Each spirometry test session must have the goal of obtaining 3 acceptable with 2 repeatable forced vital capacity maneuvers, as defined by the 2005 ATS/ERS Standardisation of Spirometry, p. 325 (incorporated by reference,  § 37.98).

        (3)  Facilities must submit spirometry results to NIOSH within 14 calendar days of testing as specified in § 37.96(c) to permit NIOSH to monitor test quality and provide a results report to each miner. NIOSH may provide quality performance feedback to the appropriate technician(s) along with suggestions for improvement.

        (4)  NIOSH may periodically conduct audits to review tests submitted by approved facilities and assess the quality of spirometry provided. Such audits may include a review of all spirometry data obtained during a specified time period or review of spirometry test data collected over time on selected miners.

        (c)  If NIOSH determines that a facility is not compliant with the policies and procedures specified in this subpart, or determines as the result of a quality assurance audit as specified in this section that a facility is not performing spirometry of adequate quality, the facility will be notified of the deficiency. The facility must promptly make appropriate arrangements for the deficiency to be rectified.

        (d)  If a facility fails to rectify deficiencies within 60 days of notification, NIOSH approval of the facility may be revoked. An approval which has been revoked may be reinstated at the discretion of NIOSH after it receives satisfactory assurances and evidence that all deficiencies have been corrected and that effective controls have been instituted by the facility to prevent a recurrence.

        (e)  When conducting spirometry tests pursuant to this subpart, physicians and facilities must maintain the results and analyses of these tests (including any hard copies or digital files containing individual data, such as interpretations) in a manner consistent with applicable statutes and regulations governing the handling and protection of individually identifiable health information, including, as applicable, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR part 160 and 45 CFR part 164, subparts A, C, and E).

      Subpart—General Requirements

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 45123, Aug. 4, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 37.100   Coal mine operator plan for medical examinations.

#### § § 37.100

        (a) Each coal mine operator must submit and receive NIOSH approval of a plan for the provision of chest radiographs, occupational histories, spirometry tests, and respiratory assessments of miners, using the appropriate forms provided by NIOSH.

        (1) During the transition from August 1, 2014 until the time when spirometry facilities are approved by NIOSH, any person becoming a coal mine operator on or after August 1, 2014, or any coal mine operator without an approved plan as of that date must submit a plan within 60 days that provides for chest radiographs and occupational histories only.

        (2) Coal mine operators with previously approved plans for only chest radiographs and occupational histories, or with plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, will be notified by MSHA when the plans must be amended to include spirometry testing and respiratory assessments. Amendments must be submitted to NIOSH within 60 days of MSHA's notification.

        (b) The coal mine operator's plan must include:

        (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the operator(s) submitting the plan;

        (2) The name, MSHA identification number for respirable dust measurements, and address of the mine included in the plan;

        (3) The proposed beginning and ending date of the 6-month period(s) for voluntary radiography exams and spirometry tests ( §§ 37.3(a) and 37.92(a)), the estimated number of miners to be given or offered examinations during the 6-month period under the plan, and a roster specifying the names and current home mailing addresses of each miner covered by the plan;

        (4) The name and location of the approved radiograph and spirometry facility or facilities, and the approximate date(s) and time(s) of day during which the radiograph examination and spirometry will be given to miners to enable a determination of whether the examinations will be conducted at a convenient time and place;

        (5) If a mobile medical examination facility is proposed to provide some or all of the surveillance tests specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the plan must provide that each miner be given adequate notice of the opportunity to have the examination and that no miner will have to wait for an examination more than 1 hour before or after his or her work shift. The plan must include:

        (i) The number of change houses at the mine.

        (ii) One or more alternate non-mobile approved medical examination facilities for the reexamination of miners and for the mandatory examination of miners when necessary ( §§ 37.3(b) and 37.92(b)), or an assurance that the mobile facility will return to the location(s) specified in the plan as frequently as necessary to provide for medical surveillance examinations in accordance with these regulations.

        (iii) The name and location of each change house at which examinations will be given. For mines with more than one change house, the examinations must be given at each change house or at a change house located at a convenient place for each miner.

        (6) Assurances that:

        (i) The operator will not solicit a physician's spirometric, radiographic or other findings concerning any miner employed by the operator;

        (ii) Instructions have been given to the person(s) giving the examinations that duplicate spirograms or copies of spirograms (including copies of electronic files) and radiographs or copies of radiographs (including, for digital radiographs, copies of electronic files) will not be made, and to the extent that it is technically feasible all related electronic files must be permanently deleted from the facility records or rendered permanently inaccessible following the confirmed transfer of such data to NIOSH, and that (except as may be necessary for the purpose of this part) the physician's spirometric, radiographic and other findings, as well as the occupational history and respiratory assessment information obtained from a miner will not be disclosed in a manner that would permit identification of the individual miner with his or her information; and

        (iii) The spirometry and radiographic examinations will be made at no charge to the miner.

        (c) Operators may provide for alternate spirometry or radiography facilities in plans submitted to NIOSH for approval.

        (d) The change of operators of any mine operating under a plan approved pursuant to § 37.101(a) must not affect the plan of the operator which has transferred responsibility for the mine. Every plan is subject to revision in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (e) The operator must advise NIOSH of any change in its plan. Each change in an approved plan is subject to the same review and approval as the originally approved plan.

        (f) The operator must promptly display in a visible location on the bulletin board at the mine its proposed plan or proposed change in a NIOSH-approved plan when it is submitted to NIOSH. The proposed plan or change in a NIOSH-approved plan must remain posted in a visible location on the bulletin board until NIOSH either grants or denies approval at which time the approved plan or denial of approval must be permanently posted. In the case of an operator who does not have a bulletin board, such as an operator that is a contractor, the operator must otherwise notify its employees of the examination arrangements. Upon request, the contractor must show NIOSH written evidence that its employees have been notified.

        (g) Upon notification from NIOSH that sufficient time has elapsed since the previous period of examinations, the operator must resubmit a plan for each of its coal mines to NIOSH for approval for the next period of examinations ( §§ 37.3(a)(2) and 37.92(a)). The plan must include the proposed beginning and ending dates of the next period of examinations and all information required by paragraph (b) of this section.

> [81 FR 73289, Oct. 24, 2016]

        § 37.101   Approval of plans.

#### § § 37.101

        (a) If, after review of any plan submitted pursuant to this subpart, NIOSH determines that the action to be taken under the plan by the operator meets the specifications of this subpart and will effectively achieve its purpose, NIOSH will approve the plan and notify the operator submitting the plan of the approval. Approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purpose of section 203 of the Act.

        (b) Where NIOSH has reason to believe that it will deny approval of a plan NIOSH will, prior to the denial, give notice in writing to the operator(s) of an opportunity to amend the plan. The notice must specify the ground(s) upon which approval is proposed to be denied.

        (c) If a plan is denied approval, NIOSH will advise the operator(s) in writing of the reasons for the denial and inform MSHA that the plan was denied.

        § 37.102   Transfer of affected miner to less dusty area.

#### § § 37.102

        (a) Any miner who, in the judgment of NIOSH, has evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis, must be afforded the option of transferring from his or her position to another position in an area of the mine where the concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere is in compliance with the MSHA requirements in 30 CFR part 90. A classification of one or more of the miner's chest radiographs as showing category 1 ( ,  ,  ), category 2 ( ,  ,  ), or category 3 ( ,  , 3/+) simple pneumoconiosis, or complicated pneumoconiosis (ILO Classification) will be accepted as such evidence. NIOSH will, at its discretion, also accept other medical examinations provided to NIOSH for review, such as computed tomography scans of the chest or lung biopsies, as evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis.

        (b) Any transfer under this section shall be in accordance with the procedures specified in 30 CFR part 90.

        § 37.103   Medical examination at miner's expense.

#### § § 37.103

        Any miner who wishes to obtain a medical examination at the miner's own expense at an approved spirometry or radiography facility and to have the complete examination submitted to NIOSH may do so, provided that the examination is made no sooner than 6 months after the most recent examination of the miner submitted to NIOSH. NIOSH will provide radiographic classification, evaluation of spirometry test results, and reporting of the results of examinations made at the miner's expense in the same manner as if they were submitted under an operator's plan. Any change in the miner's transfer rights under the Act that may result from this examination will be subject to the terms of § 37.102.

> [63 FR 66062, Dec. 1, 1998]

        § 50.402   To what program do these regulations apply?

#### § § 50.402

        This subpart applies to all grant and cooperative agreement programs, except block grants, which are administered by the National Institutes of Health; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry; the Food and Drug Administration; and the Office of Public Health and Science.

        § 50.403   What is the policy basis for these procedures?

#### § § 50.403

        The Secretary of Health and Human Services has established a Departmental Appeals Board for the purpose of providing a fair and flexible process for the appeal of written final decisions involving certain grant and cooperative agreement programs administered by constituent agencies of the Department. The regulatory provision which establishes the circumstances under which the Board will accept an appeal (45 CFR 16.3) provides, among other things, that the appellant must have exhausted any preliminary appeal process required by regulation before a formal appeal to the Departmental Board will be allowed. This subpart provides such an informal preliminary procedure for resolution of disputes in order to preclude submission of cases to the Departmental Appeals Board before an agency identified in § 50.402 has had an opportunity to review decisions of its officials and to settle disputes with grantees.

        (1) Termination, in whole or in part, of a grant for failure of the grantee to carry out its approved project in accordance with the applicable law and the terms and conditions of such assistance or for failure of the grantee otherwise to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or condition applicable to the grant.

        (2) A determination that an expenditure not allowable under the grant has been charged to the grant or that the grantee has otherwise failed to discharge its obligation to account for grant funds.

        (3) A determination that a grant is void.

        (4) A denial of a noncompeting continuation award under the project period system of funding where the denial is for failure to comply with the terms of a previous award.

        (b) A determination subject to this subpart may not be reviewed by the review committee described in § 50.405 unless an officer or employee of the agency has notified the grantee in writing of the adverse determination. The notification must set forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the grantee to respond and must inform the grantee of the opportunity for review under this subpart.

        § 50.406   What are the steps in the process?

#### § § 50.406

        (a) A grantee with respect to whom an adverse determination described in § 50.404(a) above has been made and who desires a review of that determination must submit a request for such review to the head of the appropriate agency or his or her designee no later than 30 days after the written notification of the determination is received, except that if the grantee shows good cause why an extension of time should be granted, the head of the appropriate agency or his or her designee may grant an extension of time.

        (b) The request for review must include a copy of the adverse determination, must identify the issue(s) in dispute, and must contain a full statement of the grantee's position with respect to such issue(s) and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of the grantee's position. In addition to the required written statement, the grantee shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claim.

        (c) When a request for review has been filed under this subpart with respect to an adverse determination, no action may be taken by the awarding agency pursuant to such determination until the request has been disposed of, except that the filing of the request shall not affect any authority which the agency may have to suspend assistance or otherwise to withhold or defer payments under the grant during proceedings under this subpart. This paragraph does not require the awarding agency to provide continuation funding during the appeal process to a grantee whose noncompeting continuation award has been denied.

        (d) Upon receipt of a request for review, the head of the agency or his or her designee will make a decision as to whether the dispute is reviewable under this subpart and will promptly notify the grantee and the office responsible for the adverse determination of this decision. If the head of the agency or his or her designee determines that the dispute is reviewable, he or she will forward the matter to the review committee appointed under § 50.405.

        (e) The agency involved will provide the review committee appointed under § 50.405 with copies of all relevant background materials (including applications(s), award(s), summary statement(s), and correspondence) and any additional pertinent information available. These materials must be tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each document.

        (f) The grantee shall be given an opportunity to provide the review committee with additional statements and documentation not provided in the request for review described in paragraph (b) of this section. This additional submission, which must be organized and indexed as indicated under paragraph (e) of this section, should provide only material that is relevant to the review committee's deliberation of the issues in the case.

        (g) The review committee may, at its discretion, invite the grantee and/or the agency staff to discuss the pertinent issues with the committee and to submit such additional information as the committee deems appropriate.

        (h) Based on its review, the review committee will prepare a written decision to be signed by the chairperson and each of the other committee members. The review committee shall send the written decision with a transmittal letter to the grantee and shall send a copy of both to the official responsible for the adverse determination. If the decision is adverse to the grantee's position, the transmittal letter must state the grantee's right to appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR part 16.

        § 50.604   Responsibilities of Institutions regarding Investigator financial conflicts of interest.

#### § § 50.604

        Each Institution shall:

        (a) Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforced policy on financial conflicts of interest that complies with this subpart, and make such policy available via a publicly accessible Web site. If the Institution does not have any current presence on a publicly accessible Web site (and only in those cases), the Institution shall make its written policy available to any requestor within five business days of a request. If, however, the Institution acquires a presence on a publicly accessible Web site during the time of the PHS award, the requirement to post the information on that Web site will apply within 30 calendar days. If an Institution maintains a policy on financial conflicts of interest that includes standards that are more stringent than this subpart (e.g., that require a more extensive disclosure of financial interests), the Institution shall adhere to its policy and shall provide FCOI reports regarding identified financial conflicts of interest to the PHS Awarding Component in accordance with the Institution's own standards and within the timeframe prescribed by this subpart.

        (b) Inform each Investigator of the Institution's policy on financial conflicts of interest, the Investigator's responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests, and of these regulations, and require each Investigator to complete training regarding the same prior to engaging in research related to any PHS-funded grant and at least every four years, and immediately when any of the following circumstances apply:

        (1) The Institution revises its financial conflict of interest policies or procedures in any manner that affects the requirements of Investigators;

        (2) An Investigator is new to an Institution; or

        (3) An Institution finds that an Investigator is not in compliance with the Institution's financial conflict of interest policy or management plan.

        (c) If the Institution carries out the PHS-funded research through a subrecipient (e.g., subcontractors or consortium members), the Institution (awardee Institution) must take reasonable steps to ensure that any subrecipient Investigator complies with this subpart by:

        (1) Incorporating as part of a written agreement with the subrecipient terms that establish whether the financial conflicts of interest policy of the awardee Institution or that of the subrecipient will apply to the subrecipient's Investigators.

        (i) If the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the subrecipient shall certify as part of the agreement referenced above that its policy complies with this subpart. If the subrecipient cannot provide such certification, the agreement shall state that subrecipient Investigators are subject to the financial conflicts of interest policy of the awardee Institution for disclosing significant financial interests that are directly related to the subrecipient's work for the awardee Institution;

        (ii) Additionally, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the subrecipient to report all identified financial conflicts of interest to the awardee Institution. Such time period(s) shall be sufficient to enable the awardee Institution to provide timely FCOI reports, as necessary, to the PHS as required by this subpart;

        (iii) Alternatively, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the awardee Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy, the agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the subrecipient to submit all Investigator disclosures of significant financial interests to the awardee Institution. Such time period(s) shall be sufficient to enable the awardee Institution to comply timely with its review, management, and reporting obligations under this subpart.

        (2) Providing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component regarding all financial conflicts of interest of all subrecipient Investigators consistent with this subpart,  prior to the expenditure of funds and within 60 days of any subsequently identified FCOI.

        (d) Designate an institutional official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the PHS-funded research.

        (e)(1) Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the PHS-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interests (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than the time of application for PHS-funded research.

        (2) Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution, during the period of the award. Such disclosure shall include any information that was not disclosed initially to the Institution pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or in a subsequent disclosure of significant financial interests (e.g., any financial conflict of interest identified on a PHS-funded project that was transferred from another Institution), and shall include updated information regarding any previously disclosed significant financial interest (e.g., the updated value of a previously disclosed equity interest).

        (3) Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests within thirty days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through purchase, marriage, or inheritance) a new significant financial interest.

        (f) Provide guidelines consistent with this subpart for the designated institutional official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant financial interest is related to PHS-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to PHS-funded research when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: could be affected by the PHS-funded research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. The Institution may involve the Investigator in the designated official(s)'s determination of whether a significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research. A financial conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research.

        (g) Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subrecipient Investigator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and a mitigation report pursuant to § 50.605(a).

        (h) Provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS as required pursuant to § 50.605(b).

        (i) Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosures (whether or not a disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest) and all actions under the Institution's policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least three years from the date the final expenditures report is submitted to the PHS or, where applicable, from other dates specified in 45 CFR 75.361 for different situations.

        (j) Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for employee sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure Investigator compliance as appropriate.

        (k) Certify, in each application for funding to which this subpart applies, that the Institution:

        (1) Has in effect at that Institution an up-to-date, written, and enforced administrative process to identify and manage financial conflicts of interest with respect to all research projects for which funding is sought or received from the PHS;

        (2) Shall promote and enforce Investigator compliance with this subpart's requirements including those pertaining to disclosure of significant financial interests;

        (3) Shall manage financial conflicts of interest and provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component consistent with this subpart;

        (4) Agrees to make information available, promptly upon request, to the HHS relating to any Investigator disclosure of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, whether or not the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest; and

        (5) Shall fully comply with the requirements of this subpart.

        § 50.605   Management and reporting of financial conflicts of interest.

#### § § 50.605

        (a) Management of financial conflicts of interest.

        (1) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the designated official(s) of an Institution shall, consistent with § 50.604(f): review all Investigator disclosures of significant financial interests; determine whether any significant financial interests relate to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so, develop and implement a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and shall be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest. Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage a financial conflict of interest include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Public disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (e.g., when presenting or publishing the research);

        (ii) For research projects involving human subjects research, disclosure of financial conflicts of interest directly to participants;

        (iii) Appointment of an independent monitor capable of taking measures to protect the design, conduct, and reporting of the research against bias resulting from the financial conflict of interest;

        (iv) Modification of the research plan;

        (v) Change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of personnel from participation in all or a portion of the research;

        (vi) Reduction or elimination of the financial interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest); or

        (vii) Severance of relationships that create financial conflicts.

        (2) Whenever, in the course of an ongoing PHS-funded research project, an Investigator who is new to participating in the research project discloses a significant financial interest or an existing Investigator discloses a new significant financial interest to the Institution, the designated official(s) of the Institution shall, within sixty days: review the disclosure of the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so, implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest. Depending on the nature of the significant financial interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date of disclosure and the completion of the Institution's review.

        (3) Whenever an Institution identifies a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or, for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed by the Institution during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., was not timely reviewed or reported by a subrecipient), the designated official(s) shall, within sixty days: review the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so:

        (i) Implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest going forward;

        (ii)(A) In addition, whenever a financial conflict of interest is not identified or managed in a timely manner including failure by the Investigator to disclose a significant financial interest that is determined by the Institution to constitute a financial conflict of interest; failure by the Institution to review or manage such a financial conflict of interest; or failure by the Investigator to comply with a financial conflict of interest management plan, the Institution shall, within 120 days of the Institution's determination of noncompliance, complete a retrospective review of the Investigator's activities and the PHS-funded research project to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted during the time period of the noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research.

        (B) The Institution is required to document the retrospective review; such documentation shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, all of the following key elements:

        () Project number;

        () Project title;

        () PD/PI or contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;

        () Name of the Investigator with the FCOI;

        () Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;

        () Reason(s) for the retrospective review;

        () Detailed methodology used for the retrospective review (e.g., methodology of the review process, composition of the review panel, documents reviewed);

        () Findings of the review; and

        () Conclusions of the review.

        (iii) Based on the results of the retrospective review, if appropriate, the Institution shall update the previously submitted FCOI report, specifying the actions that will be taken to manage the financial conflict of interest going forward. If bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component. The mitigation report must include, at a minimum, the key elements documented in the retrospective review above and a description of the impact of the bias on the research project and the Institution's plan of action or actions taken to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the bias (e.g., impact on the research project; extent of harm done, including any qualitative and quantitative data to support any actual or future harm; analysis of whether the research project is salvageable). Thereafter, the Institution will submit FCOI reports annually, as specified elsewhere in this subpart. Depending on the nature of the financial conflict of interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date that the financial conflict of interest or the Investigator's noncompliance is determined and the completion of the Institution's retrospective review.

        (4) Whenever an Institution implements a management plan pursuant to this subpart, the Institution shall monitor Investigator compliance with the management plan on an ongoing basis until the completion of the PHS-funded research project.

        (5)(i) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall ensure public accessibility, via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, of information concerning any significant financial interest disclosed to the Institution that meets the following three criteria:

        (A) The significant financial interest was disclosed and is still held by the senior/key personnel as defined by this subpart;

        (B) The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research; and

        (C) The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest.

        (ii) The information that the Institution makes available via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, shall include, at a minimum, the following: the Investigator's name; the Investigator's title and role with respect to the research project; the name of the entity in which the significant financial interest is held; the nature of the significant financial interest; and the approximate dollar value of the significant financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value.

        (iii) If the Institution uses a publicly accessible Web site for the purposes of this subsection, the information that the Institution posts shall be updated at least annually. In addition, the Institution shall update the Web site within sixty days of the Institution's receipt or identification of information concerning any additional significant financial interest of the senior/key personnel for the PHS-funded research project that was not previously disclosed, or upon the disclosure of a significant financial interest of senior/key personnel new to the PHS-funded research project, if the Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research and is a financial conflict of interest. The Web site shall note that the information provided is current as of the date listed and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest. If the Institution responds to written requests for the purposes of this subsection, the Institution will note in its written response that the information provided is current as of the date of the correspondence and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest, which should be requested subsequently by the requestor.

        (iv) Information concerning the significant financial interests of an individual subject to paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall remain available, for responses to written requests or for posting via the Institution's publicly accessible Web site for at least three years from the date that the information was most recently updated.

        (6) In addition to the types of financial conflicts of interest as defined in this subpart that must be managed pursuant to this section, an Institution may require the management of other financial conflicts of interest in its policy on financial conflicts of interest, as the Institution deems appropriate.

        (b) Reporting of financial conflicts of interest.

        (1) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an FCOI report regarding any Investigator's significant financial interest found by the Institution to be conflicting and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this subpart. In cases in which the Institution identifies a financial conflict of interest and eliminates it prior to the expenditure of PHS-awarded funds, the Institution shall not submit an FCOI report to the PHS Awarding Component.

        (2) For any significant financial interest that the Institution identifies as conflicting subsequent to the Institution's initial FCOI report during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., upon the participation of an Investigator who is new to the research project), the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component, within sixty days, an FCOI report regarding the financial conflict of interest and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this subpart. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, where such FCOI report involves a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or, for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed or managed by the Institution (e.g., was not timely reviewed or reported by a subrecipient), the Institution also is required to complete a retrospective review to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted prior to the identification and management of the financial conflict of interest was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research. Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, if bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component.

        (3) Any FCOI report required under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall include sufficient information to enable the PHS Awarding Component to understand the nature and extent of the financial conflict, and to assess the appropriateness of the Institution's management plan. Elements of the FCOI report shall include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:

        (i) Project number;

        (ii) PD/PI or Contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;

        (iii) Name of the Investigator with the financial conflict of interest;

        (iv) Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;

        (v) Nature of the financial interest (e.g., equity, consulting fee, travel reimbursement, honorarium);

        (vi) Value of the financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value;

        (vii) A description of how the financial interest relates to the PHS-funded research and the basis for the Institution's determination that the financial interest conflicts with such research; and

        (viii) A description of the key elements of the Institution's management plan, including:

        (A) Role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project;

        (B) Conditions of the management plan;

        (C) How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project;

        (D) Confirmation of the Investigator's agreement to the management plan;

        (E) How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance; and

        (F) Other information as needed.

        (4) For any financial conflict of interest previously reported by the Institution with regard to an ongoing PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an annual FCOI report that addresses the status of the financial conflict of interest and any changes to the management plan for the duration of the PHS-funded research project. The annual FCOI report shall specify whether the financial conflict is still being managed or explain why the financial conflict of interest no longer exists. The Institution shall provide annual FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component for the duration of the project period (including extensions with or without funds) in the time and manner specified by the PHS Awarding Component.

        (5) In addition to the types of financial conflicts of interest as defined in this subpart that must be reported pursuant to this section, an Institution may require the reporting of other financial conflicts of interest in its policy on financial conflicts of interest, as the Institution deems appropriate.

        § 50.606   Remedies.

#### § § 50.606

        (a) If the failure of an Investigator to comply with an Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution shall promptly notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action taken or to be taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action, or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the PHS-funded research project. PHS may, for example, require Institutions employing such an Investigator to enforce any applicable corrective actions prior to a PHS award or when the transfer of a PHS grant(s) involves such an Investigator.

        (b) The PHS Awarding Component and/or HHS may inquire at any time before, during, or after award into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests and the Institution's review (including any retrospective review) of, and response to, such disclosure, regardless of whether the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest. An Institution is required to submit, or permit on site review of, all records pertinent to compliance with this subpart. To the extent permitted by law, HHS will maintain the confidentiality of all records of financial interests. On the basis of its review of records or other information that may be available, the PHS Awarding Component may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed the financial conflict of interest in accordance with this subpart. The PHS Awarding Component may determine that imposition of specific award conditions under 45 CFR 75.207, or suspension of funding or other enforcement action under 45 CFR 75.371, is necessary until the matter is resolved.

        (c) In any case in which the HHS determines that a PHS-funded project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of interest that was not managed or reported by the Institution as required by this subpart, the Institution shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations .

        (b) A P&A system shall establish policies and procedures to guide and coordinate advocacy activities. The P&A system shall not implement a policy or practice restricting the remedies which may be sought on behalf of individuals with mental illness or compromising the authority of the P&A system to pursue such remedies through litigation, legal action or other forms of advocacy. However, this requirement does not prevent the P&A system from placing limitations on case or client acceptance criteria developed as part of the annual priorities. Prospective clients must be informed of any such limitations at the time they request service.

        (c) Wherever possible, the program should establish an ongoing presence in residential mental health care or treatment facilities, and relevant hospital units.

Decisions concerning the selection of individuals to receive such training shall be made in accordance with established policies, procedures and priorities of the P&A system.

        (f) A P&A system may monitor, evaluate and comment on the development and implementation of Federal, State and local laws, regulations, plans, budgets, levies, projects, policies and hearings affecting individuals with mental illness as a part of federally funded advocacy activities. A P&A system shall carry out systemic advocacy—those efforts to implement changes in policies and practices of systems that impact persons with mental illness.

        (g) Determination of “probable cause” may result from P&A system monitoring or other activities, including observation by P&A system personnel, and reviews of monitoring and other reports prepared by others whether pertaining to individuals with mental illness or to general conditions affecting their health or safety.

        (h) A P&A which is a public P&A system shall be free from hiring freezes, reductions in force, prohibitions on staff travel, or other policies imposed by the State to the extend that such policies would impact program staff or activities funded with Federal dollars and would prevent the P&A system from carrying out its mandates under the Act.

        (i) A P&A system may exercise its authority under State law where the authority exceeds the authority required by the Act. However, State law must not diminish the required authority of the Act.

        § 51.32   Resolving disputes.

#### § § 51.32

      § 51d.5   How is an emergency determined to exist?

#### § § 51d.5

      (a) In making a decision as to whether a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists for purposes of section 501(m) of the PHS Act, the Secretary, using discretion, will consider all relevant factors, but at a minimum the following must exist:

      (1) Existing State, Tribal and local systems for mental health and/or substance abuse services are overwhelmed or unable to meet the existing mental health or substance abuse needs of the local community at issue; and

      (2) This inability to meet the mental health and/or substance abuse service needs of a local community is the direct consequence of a clear precipitating event. This precipitating event must:

      (i) Have a sudden, rapid onset and a definite conclusion, such as:

      (A) A natural disaster (including, but not limited to, a hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, earthquake, fire, drought, or other natural catastrophe); or

      (B) A technological disaster (including, but not limited to, a chemical spill, a major industrial accident, or a transportation accident); or

      (ii) Result in significant:

      (A) Death,

      (B) Injury,

      (C) Exposure to life-threatening circumstances,

      (D) Hardship,

      (E) Suffering,

      (F) Loss of property, or

      (G) Loss of community infrastructure (e.g., loss of treatment facilities, staff, public transportation and/or utilities, or isolation from services); and

      (3) No other local, State, Tribal or Federal funding is available to adequately address the specific level of need resulting from the precipitating event and resulting emergency mental health and/or substance abuse service needs of the impacted community.

      (b) In making a determination that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary will consider the certification and written statements provided in accordance with § 51d.4(a)(1) or (b)(1), and other information independently available to the Secretary.

      (c) Once the Secretary determines that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary may exercise discretion to make awards to enable public entities to respond to the emergency, within the limits of funds available.

#### § § 51d.6

      (a) In assessing applications for funding, the Secretary will utilize the following criteria.

      (1)  Applicant has demonstrated mental health and/or substance abuse needs directly resulting from the precipitating event. The precipitating event is clearly identified along with information regarding its impact. Applicant has identified any high risk groups or populations with special concerns that may impact the delivery of services (e.g., children, adolescents, older adults, ethnic and cultural groups, lower income populations). This documentation of need shall include the extent of physical, psychological and social problems observed, and a description of how the estimate of the number of people to be served was made. Applicant has clearly documented that no other local, State, Tribal or Federal funding sources are available to address the need.

      (2)  Applicant has a clear plan of services to address documented needs within a defined geographic area and in a specified time period.

      § 52.6   Grant awards.

#### § § 52.6

      (a) Within the limits of funds available for that purpose, the Secretary will award a grant to those applicants whose approved projects will in the Secretary's judgment best promote the purposes of the statute authorizing the grant and the regulations of this part. The date specified by the Secretary as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than 9 months following the date of any initial or new award statement unless the Secretary finds that because of the nature of a project or the grantee's particular circumstances earlier assurance of grant support is required to initiate the project. Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award and the applicable cost principles prescribed in 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

      (b)  Grants under section 2314 of the Act to support research relating to the evaluation of drug treatments for AIDS not approved by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall be subject to appropriate scientific and ethical guidelines established by the Secretary for each project, pursuant to section 2314(c) of the Act. In order to receive a grant, the applicant must agree to comply with those guidelines.

      (c)  (1) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.

      (2) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit an application at the time and in the form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe to have support continued for each subsequent year.

      (3) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

      (d)  Whenever a research project involves a number of different but related problems, activities or disciplines which require evaluation by different groups, or whenever support for a project could be more effectively administered by separate handling of separate aspects of the project, the Secretary may evaluate, approve, and make one or more awards pursuant to one or more applications. When making more than one award in response to a single application, the Secretary shall consult with the applicant organization(s), as appropriate.

      (e)  The Secretary may permit unobligated grant funds remaining in the grant account at the close of a budget period to be carried forward for obligation during a subsequent budget period, provided a continuation award is made for that period and the Secretary's written approval is obtained.

      (f)  The Secretary, upon application in accordance with the provisions of § 52.4 and without further action by a Council or other body, may make a grant to any institution or other person eligible under § 52.3 for continuation of a currently supported project for which a grant was previously made to another institution or person, provided the Secretary finds that the change in the conduct of the project is consonant with the previous evaluation and approval of the project under § 52.5.

      § 52.7   Use of funds; changes.

#### § § 52.7

      (a)  The grantee may not in whole or in part delegate or transfer to another person responsibility for the use or expenditure of grant funds.

      (b)  The permissible changes by the principal investigator in the approved project shall be limited to changes in methodology, approach or other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the project's research objectives, including changes that grow out of the approved project and serve the best scientific strategy. If the grantee and the principal investigator are uncertain whether a change complies with this provision, the question must be referred to the Secretary for a final determination.

      (c)  The project period determined pursuant to § 52.5(b) may be extended by the Secretary, with or without additional grant support, for such an additional period as the Secretary determines may be required to complete, or fulfill the purposes of, the approved project.

      (6) The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant;

      (7) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the proposed program; and

      (8) Other factors which the awarding institute, center, or division considers appropriate in light of its particular statutory mission.

      (b) Where required by statute or NIH policy, applications are reviewed by appropriate national advisory councils or boards before awards are made. NIH grants may be awarded generally only after approval recommendations from both appropriate scientific peer review groups and national advisory councils or boards.

      § 52a.6   Information about grant awards.

#### § § 52a.6

      (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long NIH intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.

      (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year, and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by the NIH that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

      (c) Neither the approval of any application, nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

      § 52a.7   For what purposes may a grantee spend grant funds?

#### § § 52a.7

      A grantee shall spend funds it receives under this part solely in accordance with the approved application and budget, the authorizing legislation, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles prescribed in 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

      § 52e.5   What are the project requirements?

#### § § 52e.5

      (a) An approvable application must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that:

      (1) With respect to applications relating to projects covered by § 52e.1(a)(1), the techniques or procedures to be demonstrated and evaluated have been found safe and effective in the research setting and, based upon research findings, appear to have the potential for general applicability to the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, or blood diseases;

      (2) With respect to applications relating to projects covered by § 52e.1(a)(2) and § 52e.1(a)(3), the project will include development and evaluation of one or more methods for educating health practitioners or the public concerning advances in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of such diseases; and

      (3) The nature of the project is such that its completion may be anticipated within the project period, or such other period as may be specified in the application.

      (b) The project must, in the judgment of the Director, be necessary for cooperation by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with one or more other Federal Health agencies, State, local or regional public health agencies, or nonprofit private health agencies in the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung or blood diseases.

      § 52e.6   How will NIH evaluate applications?

#### § § 52e.6

      (a) Within the limits of funds available, after consultation with the Council, the Director may award grants to applicants with proposed projects which in the Director's judgment will best promote the purposes of section 419 of the Act, taking into consideration among other pertinent factors:

      (1) The scientific and technical merit of the proposed project;

      (2) The significance of the project in relation to the goals of the National Program;

      (3) Whether the project appropriately emphasizes the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, or blood diseases of children;

      (4) The qualifications and experience of the project director and other key personnel;

      (5) The administrative and managerial capability and fiscal responsibility of the applicant;

      (6) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the proposed project;

      (7) The adequacy of the methods proposed for monitoring and evaluating the proposed project; and

      (8) The degree to which the application adequately provides for the requirements set forth in §§ 52e.5(a) and 52e.5(b).

      (b) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years.

      (c) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of the government.

      (d) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

      (e) Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms, and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles prescribed in 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

> [45 FR 12249, Feb. 25, 1980, as amended at 58 FR 54298, Oct. 21, 1993; 81 FR 3008, Jan. 20, 2016]

      § 52e.7   What are the terms and conditions of awards?

#### § § 52e.7

      (a) Any funds granted pursuant to this part shall be expended solely for the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles prescribed by 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

      (b) The Director may permit unobligated grant funds remaining in the grant account at the close of a budget period to be carried forward for obligation during a subsequent budget period, provided a continuation award is made for that period and the NHLBI Director's written approval is obtained. The amount of any subsequent award will take into consideration unobligated grant funds remaining in the grant account.

      (3) Construction grants.

      § 52h.2   Definitions.

#### § § 52h.2

      As used in this part:

      (a)  means the Public Health Service _Act_, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 ).

      (b)  means that a reviewer or close relative or professional associate of the reviewer has a financial or other interest in an application or proposal that is known to the reviewer or the government official managing the review and would cause a reasonable person to question the reviewer's impartiality if he or she were to participate in the review; the government official managing the review (the Scientific Review Administrator or equivalent) will evaluate the appearance of a conflict of interest and determine, in accordance with this subpart, whether or not the interest would likely bias the reviewer's evaluation of the application or proposal.

      (c)  means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated; except that, where the Act specifically authorizes another official to make awards in connection with a particular program, the awarding official shall mean that official and any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.

      (d)  means the interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project period is divided for budgetary and reporting purposes.

      (e)  means a parent, spouse, domestic partner, or son or daughter.

      (f)  means a written offer to enter into a contract that is submitted to the appropriate agency official by an individual or nonfederal organization which includes, at a minimum, a description of the nature, purpose, duration, and cost of the project, and the methods, personnel, and facilities to be utilized in carrying it out. A contract proposal may be unsolicited by the federal government or submitted in response to a request for proposals.

      (g)  means the systematic use of knowledge gained from research to create useful materials, devices, systems, or methods.

      (h)  means the Department of Health and Human Services.

      (i)  means the _Director_ of the National Institutes of Health and any other official or employee of the National Institutes of Health to whom the authority involved has been delegated.

      (j)  as used in this part, includes cooperative agreements.

      (k)  means a group of primarily nongovernment experts qualified by training and experience in particular scientific or technical fields, or as authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review, to give expert advice on the scientific and technical merit of grant applications or contract proposals, or the concept of contract projects, in accordance with this part.

      (l)  has the same meaning as in 42 CFR part 52.

      (m)  means any colleague, scientific mentor, or student with whom the peer reviewer is currently conducting research or other significant professional activities or with whom the member has conducted such activities within three years of the date of the review.

      (n)  means the methodology to be followed and the resources needed in carrying out the project.

      (o)  means the basic purpose, scope, and objectives of the project.

      (p)  has the same meaning as in 42 CFR part 52.

      (q)  means a reviewer or a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer has a financial or other interest in an application or proposal that is known to the reviewer and is likely to bias the reviewer's evaluation of that application or proposal as determined by the government official managing the review (the Scientific Review Administrator, or equivalent), as acknowledged by the reviewer, or as prescribed by this part. A reviewer shall have a real conflict of interest if he/she or a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer:

      (1) Has received or could receive a direct financial benefit of any amount deriving from an application or proposal under review;

      (2) Apart from any direct financial benefit deriving from an application or proposal under review, has received or could receive a financial benefit from the applicant institution, offeror or principal investigator that in the aggregate exceeds $10,000 per year; this amount includes honoraria, fees, stock or other financial benefit, and additionally includes the current value of the reviewer's already existing stock holdings. The Director, NIH, may amend the dollar threshold periodically, as appropriate, after public notice and comment; or

      (3) Has any other interest in the application or proposal that is likely to bias the reviewer's evaluation of that application or proposal. Regardless of the level of financial involvement or other interest, if the reviewer feels unable to provide objective advice, he/she must recuse him/herself from the review of the application or proposal at issue. The peer review system relies on the professionalism of each reviewer to identify to the designated government official any real or apparent conflicts of interest that are likely to bias the reviewer's evaluation of an application or proposal.

      (r)  means a Government solicitation to prospective offerors, under procedures for negotiated contracts, to submit a proposal to fulfill specific agency requirements based on terms and conditions defined in the request for proposals. The request for proposals contains information sufficient to enable all offerors to prepare proposals, and is as complete as possible with respect to: nature of work to be performed; descriptions and specifications of items to be delivered; performance schedule; special requirements clauses, or other circumstances affecting the contract; format for cost proposals; and evaluation criteria by which the proposals will be evaluated.

      (s)  has the same meaning as in 42 CFR part 52.

      (t)  means an identified, circumscribed activity, involving a single contract or two or more similar, related, or interdependent contracts, intended and designed to acquire new or fuller knowledge and understanding in the areas of biomedical or behavioral research and/or to use such knowledge and understanding to develop useful materials, devices, systems, or methods.

      (u)  has the same meaning as peer review group, which is defined in paragraph (k) of this section.

      (v)  has the same meaning as the definition of offer in 48 CFR 2.101.

      (w)  has the same meaning as unsolicited proposal in 48 CFR 15.601.

      § 52h.3   Establishment and operation of peer review groups.

#### § § 52h.3

      (a) To the extent applicable, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 2) and chapter 9 of the DHHS General Administration Manual   shall govern the establishment and operation of peer review groups.

      (b) Subject to § 52h.5 and paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will adopt procedures for the conduct of reviews and the formulation of recommendations under §§ 52h.7, 52h.9, and 52h.10.

      § 52h.4   Composition of peer review groups.

#### § § 52h.4

      (a) To the extent applicable, the selection and appointment of members of peer review groups and their terms of service shall be governed by chapter 9 of the DHHS General Administration Manual.

      (b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, members will be selected based upon their training and experience in relevant scientific or technical fields, or upon their qualifications as authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review, taking into account, among other factors:

      (1) The level of formal scientific or technical education completed or experience acquired by the individual;

      (2) The extent to which the individual has engaged in relevant research, the capacities (e.g., principal investigator, assistant) in which the individual has done so, and the quality of the research;

      (3) Recognition as reflected by awards and other honors received from scientific and professional organizations; and

      (4) The need for the group to have included within its membership experts from various areas of specialization within relevant scientific or technical fields, or authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided by law, not more than one-fourth of the members of any peer review group to which this part applies may be officers or employees of the United States. Being a member of a scientific peer review group does not make an individual an officer or employee of the United States.

      § 52h.5   Conflict of interest.

#### § § 52h.5

      (a) This section applies only to conflicts of interest involving members of peer review groups. This section does not cover individuals serving on National Advisory Councils or Boards, Boards of Scientific Counselors, or Program Advisory Committees who, if not already officers or employees of the United States, are special Government employees and covered by title 18 of the United States Code, the Office of Government Ethics Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635), and Executive Order 11222, as amended. For those federal employees serving on peer review groups, in accordance with § 52h.4, the requirements of title 18 of the United States Code, 5 CFR part 2635 and Executive Order 12674, as modified by Executive Order 12731, apply.

      (b) A reviewer with a real conflict of interest must recuse him/herself from the review of the application or proposal, except as otherwise provided in this section.

      (1) A reviewer who is a salaried employee, whether full-time or part-time, of the applicant institution, offeror, or principal investigator, or is negotiating for employment, shall be considered to have a real conflict of interest with regard to an application/proposal from that organization or principal investigator, except that the Director may determine there is no real conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest where the components of a large or multicomponent organization are sufficiently independent to constitute, in effect, separate organizations, provided that the reviewer has no responsibilities at the institution that would significantly affect the other component.

      (2) Where a reviewer's real conflict of interest is based upon the financial or other interest of a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer, that reviewer must recuse him/herself, unless the Director provides a waiver in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (3) For contract proposal reviews, an individual with a real conflict of interest in a particular proposal(s) is generally not permitted to participate in the review of any proposals responding to the same request for proposals. However, if there is no other qualified reviewer available having that individual's expertise and that expertise is essential to ensure a competent and fair review, a waiver may be granted by the Director to permit that individual to serve as a reviewer of those proposals with which the reviewer has no conflict, while recusing him/herself from the review of any particular proposal(s) in which there is a conflict of interest.

      (4) The Director may waive any of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section relating to a real conflict of interest if the Director determines that there are no other practical means for securing appropriate expert advice on a particular grant or cooperative agreement application, contract project, or contract proposal, and that the real conflict of interest is not so substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of the advice to be provided by the reviewer.

      (c) Any appearance of a conflict of interest will result in recusal of the reviewer, unless the Director provides a waiver, determining that it would be difficult or impractical to carry out the review otherwise, and the integrity of the review process would not be impaired by the reviewer's participation.

      (d) When a peer review group meets regularly it is assumed that a relationship among individual reviewers in the group exists and that the group as a whole may not be objective about evaluating the work of one of its members. In such a case, a member's application or proposal shall be reviewed by another qualified review group to ensure that a competent and objective review is obtained.

      (e) When a member of a peer review group participates in or is present during the concept review of a contract proposal that occurs after release of the solicitation, as described under § 52h.10(b), but before receipt of proposals, the member is not considered to have a real conflict of interest as described in paragraph (b) of this section, but is subject to paragraph (c) of this section concerning appearance of conflict of interest if the member is planning to respond to the solicitation. When the concept review occurs after receipt of proposals, paragraph (b) applies.

      (f) No member of a peer review group may participate in any review of a specific grant application or contract project for which the member has had or is expected to have any other responsibility or involvement (whether pre-award or post-award) as an officer or employee of the United States.

      (g) The Director may periodically issue guidance to the government officials responsible for managing reviews and reviewers on what interests would constitute a real conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest.

      § 52h.6   Availability of information.

#### § § 52h.6

      (a) Transcripts, minutes, and other documents made available to or prepared for or by a peer review group will be available for public inspection and copying to the extent provided by the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 2), the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), and implementing DHHS regulations (45 CFR parts 5, 5b).

      (b) Meetings of peer review groups reviewing grant applications or contract proposals are closed to the public in accordance with sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6)) and section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 2). Documents made available to, or prepared for or by peer review groups that contain trade secrets or commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential, and personal information concerning individuals associated with applications or proposals, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, are exempt from disclosure in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 552(b)(6)).

      (c) Meetings of peer review groups reviewing contract project concepts are open to the public in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 2) and the Government in the Sunshine Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552b).

      § 52h.7   What matters must be reviewed for grants?

#### § § 52h.7

      (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, no awarding official shall award a grant based upon an application covered by this part unless the application has been reviewed by a peer review group in accordance with the provisions of this part and the group has made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of that application. In addition, where under applicable law an awarding official is required to secure the approval or advice of a national council or board concerning an application, the application may not be considered by the council or board unless it has been reviewed by the appropriate peer review group, in accordance with the provisions of this part, and the group has made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of the application, except where the council or board is the peer review group.

      (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, recommendations by peer review groups are advisory only and not binding on the awarding official or the national advisory council or board.

      § 52h.8   What are the review criteria for grants?

#### § § 52h.8

      In carrying out its review under § 52h.7, the scientific peer review group shall assess the overall impact that the project could have on the research field involved, taking into account, among other pertinent factors:

      (a) The significance of the goals of the proposed research, from a scientific or technical standpoint;

      (b) The adequacy of the approach and methodology proposed to carry out the research;

      (c) The innovativeness and originality of the proposed research;

      (d) The qualifications and experience of the principal investigator and proposed staff;

      (e) The scientific environment and reasonable availability of resources necessary to the research;

      (f) The adequacy of plans to include both genders, minorities, children and special populations as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research;

      (h) The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans, animals, and the environment, to the extent they may be adversely affected by the project proposed in the application.

      § 52h.9   What matters must be reviewed for unsolicited contract proposals?

#### § § 52h.9

      (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, no awarding official shall award a contract based upon an unsolicited contract proposal covered by this part unless the proposal has been reviewed by a peer review group in accordance with the provisions of this part and the group has made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of that proposal.

      (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, peer review group recommendations are advisory only and not binding on the awarding official.

      § 52h.10   What matters must be reviewed for solicited contract proposals?

#### § § 52h.10

      (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no awarding official shall issue a request for contract proposals with respect to a contract project involving solicited contract proposals, unless the project concept has been reviewed by a peer review group or advisory council in accordance with this part and the group has made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of the concept.

      (b) The awarding official may delay carrying out the requirements for peer review of paragraph (a) of this section until after issuing a request for proposals if the official determines that the accomplishment of essential program objectives would otherwise be placed in jeopardy and any further delay clearly would not be in the best interest of the Government. The awarding official shall specify in writing the grounds on which this determination is based. Under these circumstances, the awarding official will not award a contract until peer review of the project concept and the proposals has been completed. The request for proposals shall state that the project concept will be reviewed by a peer review group and that no award will be made until the review is conducted and recommendations made based on that review.

      (c) The awarding official may determine that peer review of the project concept for behavioral or biomedical research and development contracts is not needed if one of the following circumstances applies: the solicitation is to re-compete or extend a project that is within the scope of a current project that has been peer reviewed, or there is a Congressional authorization or mandate to conduct specific contract projects. If a substantial amount of time has passed since the concept review, the awarding official shall determine whether peer review is required to ensure the continued scientific merit of the concept.

      (d) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, the recommendations referred to in this section are advisory only and not binding on the awarding official.

      § 52h.11   What are the review criteria for contract projects and proposals?

#### § § 52h.11

      (a) In carrying out its review of a project concept under § 52h.10(a) or § 52h.10(b), the peer review group shall take into account, among other pertinent factors:

      Subparts A-K [Reserved]

      Subpart L—Services for Persons Unable To Pay; Community Service; Nondiscrimination

        § 53.111   Services for persons unable to pay.

#### § § 53.111

        (a)  The provisions of this section apply to every applicant which heretofore has given or hereafter will give an assurance that it will make available a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor but shall not apply to an applicant (1) for more than 20 years after the completion of construction of any facility with respect to which funds have been paid under section 606 of the Act or (2) beyond the period during which any amount of a direct loan made under sections 610 or 623 of the Act, or any amount of a loan with respect to which a loan guarantee and interest subsidy has been provided under sections 623 and 624 of the Act remains unpaid.

        (b)  As used in this section:

        (1) The term  includes hospitals, facilities for long-term care, outpatient facilities, rehabilitation facilities, and public health centers;

        (2) The term  means an _applicant_ for, or recipient of, a grant, a loan guarantee or a loan under the Act;

        (3)  means the fiscal year of the applicant;

        (4) The term  means the actual _operating costs_ of the applicant for a fiscal year as determined in accordance with cost determination principles and requirements under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395):  That such “operating costs” shall be determined for the applicant's entire facility and for all patients regardless of the source of payment for such care:  That in determining such operating costs there shall be deducted the amount of all actual or estimated reimbursements, as applicable, for services received or to be received pursuant to title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 and 1936);

        (5) The term  means the cost of providing services to a specific patient determined in accordance with the cost determination principles and requirements under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395) and subpart D of the regulations thereunder (20 CFR part 405,   part 401 );

        (6) The term  means services which are made available to persons unable to pay therefor without charge or at a charge which is less than the reasonable cost of such services. The level of such services is measured by the difference between the amount charged such persons for such services and the reasonable cost thereof;

        (7)  means a level of uncompensated services which meets a need for such services in the area served by an applicant and which is within the financial ability of such applicant to provide.

        (c)  (1) Before an application under this part is recommended by a State agency to the Secretary for approval, the State agency shall obtain an assurance from the applicant that there will be made available in the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor. The requirement of an assurance from an applicant shall be waived if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State agency, subject to subsequent approval by the Secretary, that such a requirement is not feasible from a financial viewpoint.

        (2) Prior to recommending that such requirement be waived, the State agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the area served by the applicant a notice of the request for such waiver and invite public comment thereon, allowing not less than 30 days therefor. All comments received shall be available for public inspection, and shall be considered by the State agency in arriving at its recommendation. Notice of the determination on the request for waiver shall be given to all interested persons and to the public before the approval of the Secretary is sought.

        (d)  An applicant which, for a fiscal year, (1) budgets for the support of, and makes available on request, uncompensated services at a level not less than the lesser of 3 percent of operating costs or 10 percent of all Federal assistance provided to or on behalf of the applicant under the Act, or (2) certifies that it will not exclude any person from admission on the ground that such person is unable to pay for needed services and that it will make available to each person so admitted services provided by the facility without charge or at a charge below reasonable cost which does not exceed any such person's ability to pay therefor as determined in accordance with criteria established pursuant to paragraph (g), shall be deemed in presumptive compliance with its assurance. In the case of a loan guarantee with interest subsidy or a direct loan guarantee be sold by the Secretary with an interest subsidy, the amount of Federal assistance shall include the total amount of the interest subsidy which the Secretary is, or will be, obligated to pay over the full life of the loan, as well as any other payments which the Secretary makes on behalf of the applicant in connection with the loan guarantee or the direct loan which has been sold.

        (e)  (1) Each applicant shall, not later than 120 days after the end of a fiscal year, unless a longer period is approved by the State agency for good cause shown, file with the State agency a copy of its annual statement for such year as required by section 646 of the Act and § 53.128(q), which shall set forth its operating costs.

        (2) With respect to each fiscal year for which a level of uncompensated services has been established in accordance with this section, the annual statement shall also set forth the amount of uncompensated services provided in such year.

        (i) The provision of a level of uncompensated services in such year which equals or exceeds the level established pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section for such year shall constitute compliance with the assurance.

        (ii) If the level of services provided was less than the level of uncompensated services established pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the applicant shall submit with such statement: A justification therefor, showing that the provision of such lower level of uncompensated services was reasonable under the circumstances; and a description of the steps it proposes to take to assure the availability and utilization of the level of uncompensated services to be established for the current fiscal year, which shall include an affirmative action plan, utilizing press releases or other appropriate means as the facility may desire to bring to the attention of the public the availability of such uncompensated services and the conditions of eligibility therefor.

        (3) Each applicant shall file with its annual statement a copy of that portion of its adopted budget for the current fiscal year relating to the support of uncompensated services in such year. Such budget for uncompensated services shall be based on the operating costs of the applicant for the preceding fiscal year and shall give due cognizance to probable increases in operating costs. Except in the case of a certification pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if the budget statement does not conform to the presumptive compliance guideline, the applicant shall submit with its statement.

        (i) A justification therefor, showing that such lower level of uncompensated services is reasonable under the circumstances, and

        (ii) A plan to increase such uncompensated services to meet the presumptive compliance guideline or such other level of uncompensated services as may have been established or as it requests the State agency to establish in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

        (4) The applicant shall also submit such additional reports related to compliance with its assurance as the State agency may reasonably require.

        (5) Pending the establishment of a level of uncompensated services for any fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the applicant shall, in such fiscal year, provide a level of services which is the higher of

        (i) The level established for the preceding fiscal year (or if no such level has been established for such prior year, the level of services provided in such year) or

        (ii) The level proposed in its adopted budget for the current fiscal year.

        (f)  (1) In determining the amount of uncompensated services provided by an applicant, there shall be included only those services provided to an individual with respect to whom the applicant has made a written determination prior to the provision of such services that such individual is unable to pay therefor under the criteria established pursuant to 42 CFR 53.111(g), except that:

        (i) Such determination may be made after the provision of such services in the case of services provided on an emergency basis:  That when billing is made for such service, such billing must be accompanied by substantially the information required in the posted notice under paragraph (i) of this section; and

        (ii) Such determination may be made after the provision of such services in the case of a change in circumstances as a result of the illness or injury occasioning such services (e.g., the patient's financial condition has changed due to a loss of wages resulting from the illness) or in case of insurance coverage or other resources being less than anticipated or the costs of services being greater than anticipated.  in all cases where such determination was not made prior to the provision of services, such services may not be included as uncompensated services if any collection effort has been made other than the rendering of bills permissible in the above exceptions:  That such a determination may be made at any time if the determination was hindered or delayed by reason of erroneous or incomplete information furnished by or in behalf of the patient.

        (2) There shall be excluded from the computation of uncompensated services:

        (i) Any amount which the applicant has received, or is entitled to receive, from a third party insurer or under a governmental program; and

        (ii) The reasonable cost of any services for which payment in whole or in part would be available under a governmental program (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) in which the applicant, although eligible to do so, does not participate, but only to the extent of such otherwise available payment.

        (g)  (1) The State agency shall set forth in its State plan, subject to approval by the Secretary, criteria for identifying persons unable to pay for services, which shall include persons who are otherwise self-supporting but unable to pay the full charge for needed services. Such criteria shall be based on the following or similar factors:

        (i) The health and medical care insurance coverage, personal or family income, the size of the patient's family, and other financial obligations and resources of the patient or the family in relation to the reasonable cost of the services;

        (ii) Generally recognized standards of need such as:

        () The St_a_te standard for the medically needy as determined for the purposes of the Aid for Families with Dependent Children program;

        () The current Social Security Administration poverty income level;

        () The _c_urrent Office of Economic Opportunity Income Poverty Guidelines applicable in the area; or

        (iii) Any other equivalent measures which are found by the Secretary to provide a reasonable basis for determining an individual's ability to pay for medical and hospital services.

        (2) A copy of such criteria shall be provided by the applicant, upon request, to any patient or former patient of the applicant and to any person seeking services from the applicant.

        (3) The State agency shall provide a copy of such criteria to any person requesting it.

        (h)  (1) The State agency shall set forth in its State plan procedures for the determination for each applicant of the level of uncompensated services which constitutes a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor provided that in no event shall the level of uncompensated services established under this section exceed the presumptive compliance guideline.

        (2) The State agency shall for the purpose of making such determination, review, and evaluate the annual statement, the budget and the related documents submitted by each applicant pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, by applying the following criteria:

        (i) The financial status of the applicant, taking account of income from all sources, and its financial ability to provide uncompensated services;

        (ii) The nature and quantity of services provided by the applicant;

        (iii) The need within the area served by the applicant for the provision, without charge or at charge which is less than reasonable cost, for services of the nature provided or to be provided by the applicant; and

        (iv) The extent and nature of joint or cooperative programs with other facilities for the provision of uncompensated services, and the extent and nature of outreach services directed to the needs of underserved areas.

        (3) In accordance with its findings made after such review and evaluation, the State agency shall, within 60 days after receipt of the annual statement and related documents required by paragraph (e) of this section, for each fiscal year of an applicant which begins following the expiration of 90 days after the effective date of this regulation:

        (i) Est_a__b_lish a level of uncompensated services for each applicant which may be equal to or less than the presumptive compliance guideline:  That if the State agency determines, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, that () there is a need in the area served by an applicant for a level of uncompensated services greater than the level proposed in the applicant's budget statement, and () the applicant is financially able to provide such greater level of uncompensated services, the State agency shall establish such greater level as the level applicable to the applicant; and

        (ii) Accept or modify a plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

        (4) The State agency shall notify the applicant in writing of the level of uncompensated services which it has established for the applicant for the fiscal year. At the time of notifying the applicant, the State agency shall also publish as a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the community served by the applicant the rate that has been established and a statement that the documents upon which the agency based its determination are available for public inspection at a location and time prescribed. In the case of the establishment by the State agency of a rate which is less than the presumptive compliance guideline, such notice shall also include a statement that persons wishing to object to the rate established may do so by writing to the State agency within 20 days after publication of the notice:  That the applicant may object to any level established which is greater than the level proposed in the applicant's budget statement.

        (5) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the applicant or any person or persons residing or located within the area served by the applicant, or any organization on behalf of such person or persons, may submit to the State agency within 20 days of the publication and sending of the notice objections to the rate established by the State agency for the applicant. Such objections may be supported in writing by factual information and argument. The State agency shall give public notice of receipt of the objections and shall make the objections and their supporting documents available for public inspection and comment. It may, if it believes that determination of the objections will be assisted by oral evidence or by oral argument, set a public hearing on the objections and shall give notice of such hearing to all interested parties and to the public. The State agency shall within 60 days of the expiration of the period within which objections may be filed, rule upon the objections in writing, stating its reason for sustaining or overruling them, in whole or in part, and establishing finally the rate of uncompensated services either the same as, above, or below the rate previously established, as may best accord with all of the evidence on file with or heard by the State agency. Notice of the final determination shall be mailed to all parties who filed objections or who participated in the proceedings leading to the redetermination.

        (6) Within 20 days of receipt of written notice of the final determination of a State agency after ruling on objections to the rate established by the State agency, the applicant or any other interested person or organization may submit to the Secretary a written request for review of the State agency determination. Such review shall be made upon the record of the State agency determination which shall be sustained if supported by substantial evidence and is not otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the Secretary or his designee determines that the rate established by the State agency is unsupported by the evidence in the record or is otherwise arbitrary or capricious, the Secretary or his designee shall, upon the basis of the record or upon other evidence or information which is before him or which he may obtain, establish a level of uncompensated services which he determines, in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, is appropriate.

        (7) The level of uncompensated services established for an applicant under this section for any fiscal year shall constitute a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor with respect to such applicant for such fiscal year.

        (i)  The applicant shall post notice (which shall be multilingual where the applicant serves a multilingual community), in substantially the following form, in appropriate areas within the facility (admissions, office, emergency department and business office) for the purpose of informing patients or potential patients that criteria for eligibility and applications are available upon request:

        (j)  The State plan shall provide for evaluation and enforcement of the assurance in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1) The State agency shall,

        (i) At least annually, perform evaluations of the amount of the various services provided in each facility with respect to which Federal assistance has been provided under the Act, to determine whether such assurance is being complied with; and

        (ii) Establish procedures for the investigation of complaints that such assurance is not being complied with.

        (2) Evaluation pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall be based on the annual budget of each facility for uncompensated services and on financial statements of such facilities filed pursuant to section 646 of the Act and § 53.128(q), and on such other information, including reports of investigations and hearing decisions, as the State agency deems relevant and material.

        (3) The State plan shall provide for adequate methods of enforcement of the assurance, including effective sanctions to be applied against any facility which fails to comply with such assurance. Such sanctions may include, but need not be limited to, license revocation, termination of State assistance, and court action.

        (k)  (1) The State agency shall, not less often than annually, report in writing to the Secretary its evaluation of each facility's compliance with the assurance, the disposition of each complaint received by the State agency, proposed remedial action with respect to each facility found by the State agency to be not in compliance with the assurance, and the status of such remedial action.

        (2) In addition, the State agency shall promptly report to the Regional Attorney and Regional Health Director of the Department of Health and Human Services the institution of any legal action against a facility or the State agency involving compliance with the assurance.

        (b) Each construction contract is subject to the condition that the applicant shall comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319), relating to nondiscrimination in construction contract employment, and the applicable rules, regulations, and procedures prescribed pursuant thereto.

        (c) Attention is called to the requirement of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d; 78 Stat. 252) which provides that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. A regulation implementing such title VI, applicable to assistance under this part for construction and modernization of hospitals and medical facilities, has been issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the approval of the President (45 CFR part 80).

    PART 54—CHARITABLE CHOICE REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO STATES RECEIVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT BLOCK GRANTS AND/OR PROJECTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN TRANSITION FROM HOMELESSNESS GRANTS

### Part 54

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 300x-65,  42 U.S.C. 290kk,  42 U.S.C. 300x-21,  42 U.S.C. 290cc-21,  and 42 U.S.C. 2000bb,

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 56444, Sept. 30, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

      § 54.1   Scope.

#### § § 54.1

      These provisions apply only to funds provided directly to pay for substance abuse prevention and treatment services under 42 U.S.C. 300x-21  and 42 U.S.C. 290cc-21 to 290cc-35. This part does not apply to direct funding under any such authorities for activities that do not involve the provision of substance abuse services, such as for infrastructure activities authorized under Section 1971 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300y, and for technical assistance activities. This part implements the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions, 42 U.S.C. 300x-65 and 42 U.S.C. 290kk,

      § 54.2   Definitions.

#### § § 54.2

      (a)  means the programs authorized under:

      (1) The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, 42 U.S.C. 300x to 300x-66, and

      (2) The Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Formula Grants, 42 U.S.C. 290cc-21 to 290cc-35 insofar as they fund substance abuse prevention and/or treatment services.

      (b)  means a nonprofit religious organization.

      (c)  means an individual who receives substance abuse services under a program funded in whole or in part by applicable programs.

      (d)  means a public or private entity that has received financial assistance, under an applicable program.

      (e)  means the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

      (f)  means the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 300x-65 and 42 U.S.C. 290kk,

      (g)  means funding that is provided to an organization directly by a governmental entity or intermediate organization that has the same duties under this part as a governmental entity, as opposed to funding that an organization receives as the result of the genuine and independent private choice of a beneficiary through a voucher, certificate, coupon, or other similar mechanism.

      § 54.3   Nondiscrimination against religious organizations.

#### § § 54.3

      (a) Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in applicable programs, as long as their services are provided consistent with the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Except as provided herein or in the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions, nothing in these regulations shall restrict the ability of the Federal government, or a State or local government, from applying to religious organizations the same eligibility conditions in applicable programs as are applied to any other nonprofit private organization.

      (b) Neither the Federal government nor a State or local government receiving funds under these programs shall discriminate against an organization that is, or applies to be, a program participant on the basis of religion or the organization's religious character or affiliation.

      § 54.4   Religious activities.

#### § § 54.4

      No funds provided directly from SAMHSA or the relevant State or local government to organizations participating in applicable programs may be expended for inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. If an organization conducts such activities, it must offer them separately, in time or location, from the programs or services for which it receives funds directly from SAMHSA or the relevant State or local government under any applicable program, and participation must be voluntary for the program beneficiaries.

      § 54.5   Religious character and independence.

#### § § 54.5

      A religious organization that participates in an applicable program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs. The organization may not expend funds that it receives directly from SAMHSA or the relevant State or local government to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide services supported by applicable programs, without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols. In addition, a SAMHSA-funded religious organization retains the authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.

      § 54.6   Employment practices.

#### § § 54.6

      (a) The participation of a religious organization in, or its receipt of funds from, an applicable program does not affect that organization's exemption provided under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1 regarding employment practices.

      (b) To the extent that 42 U.S.C. 300x-57(a)(2) or 42 U.S.C. 290cc-33(a)(2) precludes a program participant from employing individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on of its activities, those provisions do not apply if such program participant is a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society and can demonstrate that its religious exercise would be substantially burdened by application of these religious nondiscrimination requirements to its employment practices in the program or activity at issue. In order to make this demonstration, the program participant must certify: that it sincerely believes that employing individuals of a particular religion is important to the definition and maintenance of its religious identity, autonomy, and/or communal religious exercise; that it makes employment decisions on a religious basis in analogous programs; that the grant would materially affect its ability to provide the type of services in question; and that providing the services in question is expressive of its values or mission. The organization must maintain documentation to support these determinations and must make such documentation available to SAMHSA upon request.

      (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or affect any State law or regulation that relates to discrimination in employment.

      (d) The phrases “with respect to the employment,” “individuals of a particular religion,” and “religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society” shall have the same meaning as those terms have under section 702 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a).

      § 54.7   Nondiscrimination requirement.

#### § § 54.7

      A religious organization that is a program participant shall not, in providing program services or engaging in outreach activities under applicable programs, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to actively participate in a religious practice.

      § 54.8   Right to services from an alternative provider.

#### § § 54.8

      (a)  If an otherwise eligible program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant, within a reasonable period of time after the date of such objection, such program beneficiary shall have rights to notice, referral, and alternative services, as outlined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

      (b)  Program participants that refer an individual to alternative service providers, and the State government that administers the applicable programs, shall ensure that notice of the individual's right to services from an alternative provider is provided to all program beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries. The notice must clearly articulate the program beneficiary's right to a referral and to services that reasonably meet the requirements of timeliness, capacity, accessibility, and equivalency as discussed in this section. A model notice is set out in appendix A to part 54a.

      (c)  If a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant that is a religious organization, that participating religious organization shall, within a reasonable time after the date of such objection, refer such individual to an alternative provider. The State shall have a system in place to ensure that referrals are made to an alternative provider. That system shall ensure that the following occurs:

      (1) The religious organization that is a program participant shall, within a reasonable time after the date of such objection, refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider;

      (2) In making such referral, the program participant shall consider any list that the State or local government makes available to entities in the geographic area that provide program services, which may include utilizing any treatment locator system developed by SAMHSA;

      (3) All referrals shall be made in a manner consistent with all applicable confidentiality laws, including, but not limited to, 42 CFR Part 2 (“Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records”);

      (4) Upon referring a program beneficiary to an alternative provider, the program participant shall notify the State or responsible unit of government of such referral; and

      (5) The program participant shall ensure that the program beneficiary makes contact with the alternative provider to which he or she is referred.

      (d)  If an otherwise eligible applicant or recipient objects to the religious character of a SAMHSA-funded service provider, the recipient is entitled to receive services from an alternative provider. In such cases, the State or local agency must provide the individual with alternative services within a reasonable period of time, as defined by the State agency. That alternative provider must be reasonably accessible and have the capacity to provide comparable services to the individual. Such services shall have a value that is not less than the value of the services that the individual would have received from the program participant to which the individual had such objection, as defined by the State agency. The alternative provider need not be a secular organization. It must simply be a provider to which the recipient has no religious objection. States may define and apply the terms “reasonably accessible,” “a reasonable period of time,” “comparable,” “capacity,” and “value that is not less than.” The appropriate State or local governments that administer SAMHSA-funded programs shall ensure that notice of their right to alternative services is provided to applicants or recipients. The notice must clearly articulate the recipient's right to a referral and to services that reasonably meet the timeliness, capacity, accessibility, and equivalency requirements discussed above.

      (e)  As part of the annual report to SAMHSA, PATH grantees shall include a description of the activities the grantee has taken to comply with 42 CFR part 54.

      § 54.9   Assurances and State oversight of the Charitable Choice requirements.

#### § § 54.9

      In order to ensure that States receiving grant funding under the SAPT block grant and PATH formula grant programs comply with the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions and provide oversight of religious organizations that provide substance abuse services under such programs, States are required as part of their applications for funding to certify that they will comply with all of the requirements of such provisions and the implementing regulations under this part, and that they will provide such oversight of religious organizations.

      § 54.10   Fiscal accountability.

#### § § 54.10

      (a) Religious organizations that receive applicable program funds for substance abuse services are subject to the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations to account, in accordance with generally accepted auditing and accounting principles, for the use of such funds.

      (b) Religious organizations shall segregate Federal funds they receive under an applicable program into a separate account from non-Federal funds. Only the Federal funds shall be subject to audit by government under the SAMHSA program.

      § 54.11   Effects on State and local funds.

#### § § 54.11

      If a State or local government contributes its own funds to supplement activities carried out under the applicable programs, the State or local government has the option to separate out the Federal funds or commingle them. If the funds are commingled, the provisions of this part shall apply to all of the commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds.

      § 54.12   Treatment of intermediate organizations.

#### § § 54.12

      If a nongovernmental organization (referred to here as an “intermediate organization”), acting under a contract or other agreement with the Federal Government or a State or local government, is given the authority under the contract or agreement to select nongovernmental organizations to provide services under any applicable program, the intermediate organization shall have the same duties under this part as the government. The intermediate organization retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under this part and the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions.

      § 54.13   Educational requirements for personnel in drug treatment programs.

#### § § 54.13

      In determining whether personnel of a program participant that has a record of successful drug treatment for the preceding three years have satisfied State or local requirements for education and training, a State or local government shall not discriminate against education and training provided to such personnel by a religious organization, so long as such education and training is comparable to that provided by nonreligious organizations, or is comparable to education and training that the State or local government would otherwise credit for purposes of determining whether the relevant requirements have been satisfied.

      A religious organization that is a program participant shall not, in providing program services or engaging in outreach activities under applicable programs, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to actively participate in a religious practice.

      § 54a.8   Right to services from an alternative provider.

#### § § 54a.8

      (a)  If an otherwise eligible program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant, within a reasonable period of time after the date of such objection, such program beneficiary shall have rights to notice, referral, and alternative services, as outlined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. With respect to SAMHSA discretionary programs, for purposes of determining what is the appropriate Federal, State, or local government, the following principle shall apply: When SAMHSA provides funding directly to another unit of government, such as a State or local government, that unit of government is responsible for providing the alternative services. When SAMHSA provides discretionary grant funding directly to a nongovernmental organization, SAMHSA is the responsible unit of government.

      (b)  Program participants that refer an individual to alternative providers, and the appropriate Federal, State, or local governments that administer the applicable programs, shall ensure that notice of the individual's rights to services from an alternative provider is provided to all program beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries. The notice must clearly articulate the program beneficiary's right to a referral and to services that reasonably meet the requirements of timeliness, capacity, accessibility, and equivalency as discussed in this section. A model notice is set out in appendix A to this part.

      (c)  If a program beneficiary or a prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant that is a religious organization, that participating religious organization shall, within a reasonable time after the date of such objection, refer such individual to an alternative provider.

      (1) When the State or local government is the responsible unit of government, the State shall have a system in place to ensure that such referrals are made. That system shall ensure that the following occurs:

      (i) The religious organization that is a program participant shall, within a reasonable time after the date of such objection, refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider;

      (ii) In making such referral, the religious organization shall consider any list that the State or local government makes available to entities in the geographic area that provide program services, which may include utilizing any treatment locator system developed by SAMHSA;

      (iii) All referrals are to be made in a manner consistent with all applicable confidentiality laws, including, but not limited to, 42 CFR part 2 (“Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records”);

      (iv) Upon referring a program beneficiary to an alternative provider, the religious organization shall notify the responsible unit of government of such referral; and

      (v) The religious organization shall ensure that the program beneficiary makes contact with the alternative provider to which he or she is referred.

      (2) When SAMHSA is the responsible unit of government, the referral process is as follows:

      (i) When a program beneficiary requests alternative services, the religious organization will seek to make such a referral.

      (ii) If the religious organization cannot locate an appropriate provider of alternative services, the religious organization will contact SAMHSA. They will work together to identify additional alternative providers, utilizing the SAMHSA Treatment Locator system, if appropriate.

      (iii) The religious organization will contact these alternative providers and seek to make the referral, in a manner consistent with all applicable confidentiality laws, including, but not limited to, 42 CFR part 2 (“Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records”).

      (iv) In the event the religious organization is still unable to locate an alternative provider, it may again contact SAMHSA for assistance.

      (d)  The program participant shall notify the appropriate Federal, State or local government agency that administers the program of such referral. If a State or local government is the responsible unit of government, it may determine its own reporting procedures. When SAMHSA is the responsible unit of government, this notification will occur during the course of the regular reports that may be required under the terms of the funding award.

      (e)  The responsible unit of government, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, shall provide to an otherwise eligible program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary who objects to the religious character of a program participant, services and fund services from an alternative provider that is reasonably accessible to, and has the capacity to provide such services to the individual. Such services shall have a value that is not less than the value of the services that the individual would have received from the program participant to which the individual had such objection. The appropriate State or local governments that administer SAMHSA-funded programs shall ensure that notice of their right to alternative services is provided to applicants or recipients. The alternative provider need not be a secular organization. It must simply be a provider to which the program beneficiary has no religious objection.

      (1) When the State receives a discretionary grant from SAMHSA, it shall utilize its own implementation procedures for these provisions and shall use funds from the SAMHSA discretionary grant to finance such alternative services, as needed;

      (2) When the local government receives a discretionary grant from SAMHSA, it shall utilize State implementation procedures for these provisions and shall use funds from the SAMHSA discretionary grant to finance such alternative services, as needed;

      (3) When a religious organization receives a discretionary grant from SAMHSA, if a publicly funded alternative provider is available that is reasonably accessible and can provide equivalent services, the religious organization shall refer the beneficiary to that provider. However, if such a provider is not available, the religious organization shall contract with an alternative provider to provide such services and may finance such services with funds from the SAMHSA discretionary grant.

      § 54a.9   Oversight of the Charitable Choice requirements.

#### § § 54a.9

      In order to ensure that program funds are used in compliance with the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions, applicants for funds under applicable programs are required, as part of their applications for funding, to certify that they will comply with all of the requirements of the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions and the implementing regulations under this part.

      § 54a.10   Fiscal accountability.

#### § § 54a.10

      (a) Religious organizations that receive applicable program funds for substance abuse services are subject to the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations to account, in accordance with generally accepted auditing and accounting principles, for the use of such funds.

      (b) Religious organizations shall segregate Federal funds they receive under applicable programs into a separate account from non-Federal funds. Only the Federal funds shall be subject to audit by the government under the SAMHSA program.

      § 54a.11   Effect on State and local funds.

#### § § 54a.11

      If a State or local government contributes its own funds to supplement activities carried out under the applicable programs, the State or local government has the option to separate out the Federal funds or commingle them. If the funds are commingled, the provisions of this part shall apply to all of the commingled funds, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds.

      § 54a.12   Treatment of intermediate organizations.

#### § § 54a.12

      If a nongovernmental organization (referred to here as an “intermediate organization”), acting under a contract or other agreement with the Federal Government or a State or local government, is given the authority under the contract or agreement to select nongovernmental organizations to provide services under any applicable program, the intermediate organization shall have the same duties under this part as the government. The intermediate organization retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under this part and the SAMHSA Charitable Choice provisions.

      § 54a.13   Educational requirements for personnel in drug treatment programs.

#### § § 54a.13

      In determining whether personnel of a program participant that has a record of successful drug treatment for the preceding three years have satisfied State or local requirements for education and training, a State or local government shall not discriminate against education and training provided to such personnel by a religious organization, so long as such education and training is comparable to that provided by nonreligious organizations, or is comparable to education and training that the State or local government would otherwise credit for purposes of determining whether the relevant requirements have been satisfied.

      § 54a.14   Determination of nonprofit status.

#### § § 54a.14

      The nonprofit status of any SAMHSA applicant can be determined by any of the following:

      (a) Reference to the organization's listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code.

      (b) A copy of a currently valid IRS Tax exemption certificate.

      (c) A statement from a State taxing body, State Attorney General, or other appropriate State official certifying that the applicant organization has a nonprofit status and that none of its net earnings accrue to any private shareholder or individuals.

      (d) A certified copy of the organization's certificate of incorporation or similar document if it clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the organization.

      (e) Any of the above proof for a State or national parent organization and a statement signed by the parent organization that the applicant organization is a local nonprofit affiliate.

        (2) On the basis of a percentage of all, or a portion of, the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as fringe benefit rates) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary:  That no grant shall be made for an amount in excess of the total costs found necessary by the Secretary to carry out the project.

        (i) In determining the percentage of project costs to be borne by the grantee, factors which the Secretary will take into consideration will include the following:

        (A) The ability of the grantee to finance its share of project costs from non-Federal sources;

        (B) The need in the area served by the project for the services to be provided; and

        (C) The extent to which the project will provide services in an innovative manner which the Secretary desires to stimulate in the interest of developing more effective health service delivery systems on a regional or national basis.

        (ii) At any time after approval of an application under this part, the Secretary may retroactively agree to a percentage of project costs to be borne by the grantee lower than that determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section where he finds that changed circumstances justify a smaller contribution.

        (iii) In determining the grantee's share of project costs, costs borne by Federal grant funds, or costs used to match other Federal grants, may not be included except as otherwise provided by law or regulations.

        (b) All grant awards shall be in writing, and shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.

        (c) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award, shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make separate application.

        (c) An application will not be approved unless an agreement between the Secretary and the applicant school for a Federal capital contribution under section 721 of the Act is reached.

> [44 FR 29055, May 18, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 38112, Sept. 27, 1984; 56 FR 19293, Apr. 26, 1991; 57 FR 45734, Oct. 5, 1992; 61 FR 6123, Feb. 16, 1996]

        § 57.204   Payment of Federal capital contributions and reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary.

#### § § 57.204

        (a)  The Secretary will make payments to each school with which he or she has entered into an agreement under the Act at a time determined by him or her. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by all schools for Federal capital contributions exceeds the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:

        (1) The amount requested in the application, or

        (2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan Program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in all participating schools during that year. Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications requested more than the amount paid to them, but with whatever adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding the total requested by it.

        (b)  The payment of Federal capital contributions to a school will be paid in a manner that avoids unnecessary accumulations of money in any health professions student loan fund.

        (c)  All funds from a student loan fund established under this subpart which are remitted to the Secretary in any fiscal year shall be available for allotment under this subpart, in the same fiscal year and the succeeding fiscal year, to schools which, during the period beginning on July 1, 1972, and ending on September 30, 1985, established student loan funds with Federal capital contributions under this subpart. The Secretary will from time to time set dates by which the schools must file applications to receive a portion of these funds. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by eligible schools exceeds the amount of funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:

        (1) The amount requested in the application, or

        (2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in all eligible schools during that year.

        § 57.205   Health professions student loan funds.

#### § § 57.205

        (a)  Any fund established by a school with Federal capital contributions will be accounted for separately from other funds, providing a clear audit trail for all transactions. At all times the fund must contain monies representing the institutional capital contribution. The school must at all times maintain all monies relating to the fund in one or more interest-bearing accounts or investment instruments which meet OMB requirements established for Federal monies held by third parties. The school must place all earnings into the fund but may first deduct from total earnings any reasonable and customary charges incurred through the use of an interest-bearing account. An institution shall exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary with regard to these deposits and investments, and shall be responsible for reimbursing the fund for any losses that occur due to the use of investments that are not federally insured.

        (1) The Federal capital contribution fund is to be used by the school only for:

        (i) Health professions student loans to full-time students;

        (ii) Capital distribution as provided in section 728 of the Act or as agreed to by the school and the Secretary; and

        (iii) Costs of litigation, costs associated with membership in credit bureaus, and to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of health professions student loans.

        (2) A school must review the balance in the fund on at least a semi-annual basis to determine whether the fund balance compared with projected levels of expenditures and collections exceeds its needs. A school in closing status must review the balance in the fund on a quarterly basis. Monies identified as in excess of the school's needs must be reported, and the Federal share returned to the Federal Government, by the due date of the required report which identifies the excess monies. The school's determination is subject to the review and approval of the Secretary.

        (b)  (1) Each Federal capital loan is subject to the terms of the promissory note executed by an authorized official on behalf of the borrowing school.

        (2) The Federal capital loans must be carried in a special account of the school, to be used by the school only for (i) repayments of principal and interest on Federal capital loans; and (ii) costs of litigation; costs associated with membership in credit bureaus; and, to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of health professions student loans.

        (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of § 57.218 and the Department's Claims Collections regulations (45 CFR part 30), as appropriate.

> [44 FR 29055, May 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 25069, June 3, 1983; 56 FR 40725, Aug. 15, 1991; 61 FR 6123, Feb. 16, 1996]

        § 57.206   Eligibility and selection of health professions student loan applicants.

#### § § 57.206

        (a)  (1) Applicants are eligible for consideration for a health professions student loan if they are:

        (i) Residents of the United States and either a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, a citizen of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a citizen of the Republic of Palau, a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia;

        (ii) Enrolled, or accepted for enrollment in the school as full-time students;

        (iii) In need of the amount of the loan to pursue a full-time course of study at the school;

        (iv) Of exceptional financial need in the case of students of medicine or osteopathic medicine. A student will be considered to demonstrate exceptional financial need if the school determines that his or her resources, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, do not exceed the lesser of $6,700 or one-half of the costs of attendance at the school. Summer earnings, educational loans, veterans (G.I.) benefits and earnings during the school year will not be considered as resources in determining whether an applicant meets the eligibility criteria for exceptional financial need, but will be considered in determining the amount of funds a student may receive; and

        (v) In compliance with the requirement to register for the draft, if required to do so under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act.

        (2) An applicant who has previously attended an institution of higher education must submit a financial aid transcript which includes at least the following data:

        (i) Applicant's name and social security number;

        (ii) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by the applicant for study at an institution of higher education;

        (iii) Whether the applicant is in default on any of these loans, or owes a refund on any grants;

        (iv) Certification from each institution previously attended by the applicant that the applicant has received no financial aid, if applicable; and

        (v) From each institution previously attended, the signature of an official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on behalf of the institution.

        (b)  The school will select qualified applicants, including medical (M.D. and D.O.) applicants, and determine the amount of student loans by considering:

        (1) The financial resources available to the student by using one of the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by the Secretary of Education in combination with other information which the school has regarding the student's financial status. The school must take into account, regardless of the tax status of the student, the expected contribution from parents, spouse, self or other family members; and

        (2) The costs reasonably necessary for the student's attendance at the school, including any special needs and obligations which directly affect the student's ability to attend the school on a full-time basis. The school must document the criteria used for determining these costs.

        (c)  In addition to the factors in § 57.206(b), the school must select medical (M.D. and D.O.) students graduating after June 30, 1979, based on the order of greatest need, taking into consideration the other resources available to the student through the school. For purposes of establishing priority for selecting medical (M.D. and D.O.) student applicants to receive health professions student loans, summer earnings, educational loans, veterans (G.I.) benefits, and earnings during the school year will be considered as financial resources.

        (d)  The school must verify, to the best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the loan application. To comply with this requirement, a school may require that a student provide, for example: Photocopies of the parents', student's, and spouse's Federal income tax forms with original signatures for the most recent tax year (or certification that no Federal income tax return was filed); tax returns that are certified as having been received by the Internal Revenue Service; or other documentation that the school considers necessary to help assure that information on the loan application is correct.

        § 57.207   Maximum amount of health professions student loans.

#### § § 57.207

        The total of the health professions student loans made from the fund to any student for a school year may not exceed $2,500 and the cost of tuition. The maximum amount loaned during a 12-month period to any student enrolled in a school which provides a course of study longer than the 9-month school year may be proportionately increased.

        § 57.208   Health professions student loan promissory note and disclosure requirements.

#### § § 57.208

        (a)  Each health professions student loan must be evidenced by a properly executed promissory note in a form approved by the Secretary. The school must safeguard the promissory note against fire, theft, and tampering.

        (3) A copy of each executed note must be supplied by the school to the student borrower.

        (b)  A school must require security or endorsement if the borrower is a minor and if, under the applicable State law, the note signed by him or her would not create a binding obligation. The school may not require security or endorsement in any other circumstances.

        (c)  (1) For any loan made after June 30, 1986, the school shall, at the time the loan is made, provide the following loan information to the student:

        (i) The yearly and cumulative maximum amounts that may be borrowed by the student;

        (ii) The terms under which repayment of the loan will begin;

        (iii) The maximum number of years in which the loan must be repaid;

        (iv) The interest rate that will be paid by the borrower and the minimum amount of the required monthly payment;

        (v) The amount of any other fees charged to the borrower by the lender;

        (vi) Any options the borrower may have for deferral, cancellation, prepayment, consolidation, or other refinancing of the loan;

        (vii) A definition of default on the loan and a specification of the consequences which will result to the borrower if the borrower defaults, including a description of any arrangements which may be made with credit bureau organizations;

        (viii) To the extent practicable, the effect of accepting the loan on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student assistance; and

        (ix) A description of the actions that may be taken by the Federal Government to collect the loan, including a description of the type of information concerning the borrower that the Federal Government may disclose to:

        (A) Officers, employees, or agents of the Department of Health and Human Services,

        (B) Officers, employees, or agents of schools with which the Secretary has an agreement under this subpart, or

        (2) For any loan made after June 30, 1986, the school shall, prior to the borrower's completion or termination of studies at the school, provide the following loan information to the student:

        (i) Each amount borrowed by the student under this subpart;

        (ii) The total amount borrowed by the student under this subpart; and

        (iii) A schedule for the repayment of the amounts borrowed under this subpart, including the number, amount, and frequency of payments to be made.

        (3) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the school must comply with the applicable requirements of Truth in Lending Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226).

        § 57.209   Payment of health professions student loans.

#### § § 57.209

        (a) Health professions student loans from any fund may be paid to or on behalf of student borrowers in installments considered appropriate by the school except that a school may not pay to or on behalf of any borrower more during any given installment period (e.g., semester, term, or quarter) than the school determines the student needs for that period.

        (b) No payment may be made from a fund to or on behalf of any student borrower if at the time of the payment the borrower is not a full-time student.

        § 57.210   Repayment and collection of health professions student loans.

#### § § 57.210

        (a) Each health professions student loan, including accrued interests, will be repayable in equal or graduated periodic installments in amounts calculated on the basis of a 10-year repayment period. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, repayment of a loan must begin one year after the student ceases to be a full-time student.

        (1) If a borrower reenters the same or another school as a full-time student within the 1-year period, the date upon which interest will accrue and the repayment period will begin will be determined by the date on which the student last ceases to be a full-time student at that school.

        (2) The following periods will be excluded from the 10-year repayment period:

        (i) All periods for up to a total of 3 years of active duty performed by the borrower as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps or the U.S. Public Health Service Corps;

        (ii) All periods for up to a total of 3 years of service as a volunteer under the Peace Corps Act;

        (iii) All periods of advanced professional training including internships and residencies, except as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section;

        (iv) All periods during which the borrower is pursuing a full-time course of study at an eligible health professions school;

        (v) A period not in excess of 2 years during which a borrower who is a full-time student in a health professions school leaves the school, with the intent to return to such school as a full-time student, to engage in a full-time educational activity which is directly related to the health profession for which the individual is preparing. To qualify for such deferment, the full-time educational activity must be one which:

        (A) Is part of a joint-degree program or a formal program of joint study in conjunction with the health profession for which the borrower is preparing at the school; or

        (B) Is an activity which will enhance the borrower's knowledge and skills in the health profession for which the borrower is preparing at the school, as determined by the school.

        (vi) A period not in excess of 2 years during which a borrower who is a graduate of a health professions school participates in:

        (A) A fellowship training program which is directly related to the health profession for which the borrower prepared at the school, as determined by the school from which the borrower received his or her loan, and is engaged in by the borrower no later than 12 months after the completion of the borrower's participation in advanced professional training as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, or prior to the completion of such borrower's participation in such training. To qualify for such deferment, the fellowship training program must be one which:

        () Is a full-time activity in research or research training or in health care policy; and

        () Is a formally established fellowship program which was not created for a specific individual; or

        (B) A full-time educational activity which is directly related to the health profession for which the borrower prepared at the school, as determined by the school from which the borrower received his or her loan, and is engaged in by the borrower no later than 12 months after the completion of the borrower's participation in advanced professional training as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, or prior to the completion of the borrower's participation in such training. To qualify for such deferment, the full-time educational activity must be one which:

        () Is part of a joint-degree program in conjunction with the health profession for which the borrower prepared at the school; or

        () Is required for licensure, registration, or certification in the health profession for which the borrower received the HPSL loan; or

        () Is a full-time educational program in public health, health administration, or a health care discipline directly related to the health profession for which the borrower received the loan.

        (3) To receive a deferment, a borrower must, no later than 30 days prior to the onset of the activity (or no later than 30 days prior to the due date of the first payment if the borrower begins the activity during the grace period), and annually thereafter, provide the lending school with evidence of his or her status in the deferrable activity, and evidence that verifies deferment eligibility of the activity. This evidence must include certification by the Program Director or other authorized official that the borrower's activity meets the deferment requirements. The borrower must also notify the school upon completion or termination of the activity. It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the lending school with all required information or other information regarding the requested deferment. The school may deny a request for deferment if it is not filed in accordance with the requirements of this section.

        (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a borrower must establish a repayment schedule with the school providing for payments not less often than quarterly. Any borrower whose repayment is delinquent more than 60 days must establish a monthly repayment schedule with the school. However, a borrower may at his or her option and without penalty, prepay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any time.

        (5) A school may grant forbearance whenever extraordinary circumstances such as unemployment, poor health or other personal problems temporarily affect the borrower's ability to make scheduled loan repayments.

        (b)(1) Each school at which a fund is established must exercise due diligence in the collection of health professions student loans due the fund. In the exercise of due diligence, a school must follow procedures which are at least as extensive and effective as those used in the collection of other student loan accounts due the school, and must use the steps outlined below in accordance with collection practices which are generally accepted among institutions of higher education:

        (i) Conduct and document an entrance interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower prior to disbursing HPSL funds in an academic year. During the entrance interview the school must obtain documentation which indicates that the borrower is aware of the rights and responsibilities associated with HPSL funds and personal information which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. The requirements of this subparagraph may be met by correspondence, if the school determines that a face-to-face meeting (individually or in groups) is impracticable.

        (ii) Conduct and document an exit interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower. During the exit interview, the school must provide each borrower with information necessary to carry out the terms of repayment, remind the borrower of the rights and responsibilities associated with HPSL funds, and update the personal information collected prior to disbursing HPSL funds which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. If the borrower terminates studies without advance notice, the school must document attempts to inform the borrower of the substance of the exit interview and to secure exit interview information from the borrower by mail.

        (iii) Notify the borrower in writing of the impending repayment obligation at least twice during the grace period;

        (iv) Notify a borrower who is in deferment status in writing of the impending repayment obligation 1 to 3 months prior to the expiration of the approved period of deferment;

        (v) Perform regular billing;

        (vi) Follow up past due payments with a series of at least four documented and reasonably spaced attempts to contact the borrower, at least three of which must be in writing at not more than 30-day intervals, prior to the loan becoming 120 days past due, provided that the school has a current address for the borrower;

        (vii) Perform address searches when necessary;

        (viii) Use collection agents, which may include the use of an internal collection agent;

        (ix) Institute legal proceedings against borrowers after all other attempts at collection have failed, unless the school determines, subject to the approval of the Secretary, that such litigation would not be cost-effective; and

        (x) Become a member of a credit bureau and notify the credit bureau of accounts past due by more than 120 days.

        (2)  (i) For any health professions student loan made after June 30, 1969, but prior to October 22, 1985, the school may fix a charge for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under section 722(c) of the Act for any failure to file timely and satisfactory evidence of the entitlement. The amount of the charge may not exceed $1 for the first month or part of a month by which the installment or evidence is late and $2 for each succeeding month or part of a month. The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the day after the day on which the installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no later than the due date of the next installment following receipt of the notice of the charge by the borrower.

        (ii) For any health professions student loan made on or after October 22, 1985, the school shall assess a charge for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when the loan is more than 60 days past due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under section 722(c) of the Act, for any failure to file satisfactory evidence of the entitlement within 60 days of the date payment would otherwise be due. No charge may be made if the loan is less than 61 days past due. The amount of this charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount due at the time the charge is calculated. The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the day on which the charge is calculated, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no later than the due date of the next installment following receipt of the notice of the charge by the borrower.

        (3) With respect to any health professions student loan made after June 30, 1969, the school may require the borrower to make payments of at least $15 per month on all outstanding health professions student loans during the repayment period.

        (4) A school must, on an annual basis, review and assess the collectibility of any loan more than 3 years past due. If the school determines that the prospects of future collection are promising enough to justify periodic review of the debt, and neither the statute of limitations nor the 10-year repayment period has expired, the school may retain the account for continued collections, provided that it makes an attempt at least semi-annually to collect from the borrower. When the due diligence procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been exhausted, the school is responsible for determining the collection methods it will use for the semi-annual collection effort required on these loans. If the school determines that the prospects of future collection are not promising, or when the statute of limitations or the 10-year repayment period has expired, the loan must be considered uncollectible. A school may determine a loan to be uncollectible sooner than 3 years past due when it has evidence that the loan cannot be collected, but in no case should a school consider a loan as uncollectible if it has not been in default for a least 120 days. A school is not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and (iii) of this section for loans that became uncollectible, as determined by the school, before August 1, 1985.

        (i) A school must request permission to write off an uncollectible loan within 30 days of the determination that it is uncollectible or reimburse the fund in the full amount of the loan, pursuant to § 57.210(b)(4)(iii). The 30-day period for submitting the loan for write-off review begins on the date that the determination of uncollectibility is made, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In any instance where the Secretary determines that a school has failed to exercise due diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, the school will be required to place in the fund the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on the loan. Reimbursement must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less than 30 days following the Secretary's disapproval of the request for write-off approval.

        (ii) If the Secretary determines that a school has exercised due diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or if the school determines that the loan was uncollectible prior to August 1, 1985, the school will be permitted to reduce its accounts receivable for the HPSL fund by the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on that loan and will not be required to return the Federal share of the loss to the Secretary.

        (iii) If a school does not request permission to write off an uncollectible loan within the required timeframe, it must reimburse the fund for the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on that loan. This reimbursement must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less than 30 days following its determination that a loan is uncollectible.

        (iv) Failure to comply with the requirement of this section will subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of § 57.218 and the Department's Claims Collection regulations (45 CFR part 30), as appropriate.

        (5)  Upon written request by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may disclose the address of any taxpayer who has defaulted on a health professions student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents of the Department, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect the loan. Any such mailing address may be disclosed by the Secretary to any school from which the defaulted borrower received a health professions student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents of the school whose duties relate to the collection of health professions student loan funds, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect the loan. Any school which requests and obtains this address information must comply with the requirements of the Secretary and the IRS regarding the safeguarding and proper handling of this information.

        (b)  The Secretary will cancel a student borrower's indebtedness in accordance with section 722(d) of the Act upon the death of the borrower. The school to which the borrower was indebted must secure a certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under State law.

#### § § 57.213a

        (a) For loans made prior to October 22, 1985, in the event that insufficient funds are available to the Secretary in any fiscal year to enable him or her to pay to all schools their proportionate shares of all loans and interest canceled under this subpart for practice in a shortage area, death, or disability:

        (1) Each school will be paid an amount bearing the same ratio to the total of the funds available for that purpose as the principal of loans canceled by that school in that fiscal year bears to the total principal of loans canceled by all schools in that year; and

        (2) Any additional amounts to which a school is entitled will be paid by the Secretary at the time of distribution of the assets of the school's Fund under section 728 of the Act.

        (b) For loans made on or after October 22, 1985, a school may assess the borrower a charge to insure against the loss of the institutional share of a loan canceled due to the borrower's death or permanent and total disability. The school must develop annually a rate which reflects its cancellation experience. This charge shall not exceed .6 percent of the loan amount. Funds collected under this provision must be maintained by the school in an insured, interest-bearing account (with any earned interest credited to this insurance fund), and used only to reimburse the school for the institutional share of any HPSL loan made on or after October 22, 1985, that is canceled due to the borrower's death or permanent and total disability. A school is not required to establish a separate bank account, but is required to maintain separate accountability.

#### § § 57.214

        In the event that the Secretary undertakes to repay educational loans under section 722(k) of the Act, he or she will use the following criteria to make a determination as to each applicant's eligibility:

        (a) An applicant will be considered to have failed to complete the course of study leading to the first professional degree for which an eligible education loan was made upon certification by a health professions school that the individual ceased to be enrolled in the school subsequent to November 17, 1971;

        (b) An applicant will be considered to be in exceptionally needy circumstances if, upon comparison of the income and other financial resources of the applicant with his or her expenses and financial obligations, the Secretary determines that repayment of the loan would constitute a serious economic burden on the applicant. In making this determination, the Secretary will take into consideration the applicant's net financial assets, his or her potential earning capacity, and the relationship of the income available to the applicant to the low-income levels published annually by the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this section;

        (c) An applicant will be considered to be from a low-income family if the applicant comes from a family with an annual income below a level based on low-income thresholds according to family size published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary for use in this program, and the family has no substantial net financial assets. Income levels as adjusted will be published annually by the Secretary in the

        (d) An applicant will be considered to be from a disadvantaged family if the individual comes from a family in which the annual income minus unusual expenses which contribute to the economic burdens borne by the family does not exceed the low-income levels published by the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this section and the family has no substantial net financial assets;

        (e) An applicant will be considered as not having resumed his or her health professions studies within two years following the date the individual ceased to be a student upon a certification so stating from the applicant; and

        (f) An applicant will be considered as not reasonably expected to resume his or her health professions studies within two years following the date upon which he or she terminated these studies, based upon consideration of the reasons for the applicant's failure to complete these studies, taking into account such factors as academic, medical, or financial difficulties.

The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:

        (ii) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or

        (iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.

        (3) The school must also comply with the requirements of 45 CFR part 75 and section 798(e) of the Act concerning recordkeeping, audit, and inspection.

        (b) The following student records must be retained by the school for 5 years after an individual student ceases to be a full-time student:

        (5) Copies of all correspondence to or from the borrower and endorser;

        (6) Copies of all correspondence with collection agents related to the individual borrower;

        (8) Copies of all correspondence relating to uncollectible loans which have been written off by the Federal Government or repaid by the school.

        (d) The school must also retain other records as the Secretary may prescribe. In all cases where questions have arisen as a result of a Federal audit, the records must be retained until resolution of all questions.

        (e) Institutional officials who have information which indicates the potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the United States, involving these loan funds, should promptly provide this information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for Investigations.

        (1) The term  means the total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or canceled) on loans in default for more than 120 days; and

        (2) The term  means the total principal amount of all loans made by a school under this subpart minus the total principal amount of loans made by the school to students who are:

        (i) Enrolled in a full-time course of study at the school; or

        (b) Any school that has a default rate greater than 5 percent on June 30 of any year will be required to:

        (1) Reduce its default rate by 50 percent (or a school with a default rate below 10 percent must reduce its rate to 5 percent) by the close of the following 6-month period; and

        (2) By the end of each succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default rate to 50 percent of the required rate for the previous 6-month period, until it reaches 5 percent.

        (c) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section which fails to comply with those requirements will receive no new HPSL funds and will be required to:

        (1) Place the revolving fund monies and all subsequent collections into an insured interest-bearing account;

        (2) Make no loan disbursements; and

        (3) By the end of the succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default rate to 50 percent of the rate it failed to achieve under paragraph (b) of this section, or 5 percent. A school that meets this requirement will be permitted to resume the use of its health professions student loan funds, but must continue to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section if its default rate is still greater than 5 percent.

        (d) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section which fails to comply with those requirements will be subject to termination. The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:

        § 57.218   Noncompliance.

#### § § 57.218

        Wherever the Secretary finds that a participating school has failed to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act or the regulations of this subpart, he or she may, on reasonable notice to the school, withhold further payment of Federal capital contributions, and take such other action, including the termination of any agreement, as he or she finds necessary to enforce the Act and regulations. In this case no further expenditures shall be made from the health professions student loan fund or funds involved until the Secretary determines that there is no longer any failure of compliance.

        § 57.304   Payment of Federal capital contributions and reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary.

#### § § 57.304

        (a)  The Secretary will make payments at a time determined by him or her, to each school with which he or she has entered into an agreement under the Act.

        (1) For any fiscal year for which “set-aside” funds are available, the Secretary will first make payments in the manner described in (a)(2) of this section of not less than $1,000,000 of the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for making loans under this subpart. These funds will be paid to schools submitting an application for “set-aside” funds to be used only for the purpose of making loans to individuals qualified to receive loans under this subpart who, on the date they receive the loan, have not been employed on a full-time basis or been enrolled in any educational institution on a full-time basis for at least 7 years. An individual may not receive a loan under this subparagraph that exceeds $500 for any academic year.

        (2) If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by all schools for Federal capital contributions minus the amount received under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller: (i) The amount requested in the application, or (ii) an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in all participating schools during that year.

        (3) Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications requested more than the amount paid to them, but with whatever adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding the total requested by it.

        (b)  The payment of Federal capital contributions to a school will be paid in a manner that avoids unnecessary accumulations of money in any nursing student loan fund.

        (c)  (1) All funds from a student loan fund established under this subpart which are remitted to the Secretary in any fiscal year shall be available for allotment under this subpart, in the same fiscal year and the succeeding fiscal year, to eligible nursing schools. In making these allotments, the Secretary shall give priority to nursing schools which established a student loan fund under this subpart after September 30, 1975. The Secretary will make payments to eligible schools at a time determined by him or her, according to the procedures indicated in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.

        (2)  The Secretary will make awards first to those eligible schools that established a nursing student loan fund after September 30, 1975. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by these schools exceeds the amount of funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:

        (i) The amount requested in the application, or

        (ii) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in these eligible schools during that year.

        (3)  If there are funds remaining after making awards as specified by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary will make awards to eligible schools which established a nursing student loan fund prior to October 1, 1975. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by these schools exceeds the amount of funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:

        (i) The amount requested in the application, or

        (ii) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in these eligible schools during that year.

        § 57.305   Nursing student loan funds.

#### § § 57.305

        (a)  Any fund established by a school with Federal capital contributions will be accounted for separately from other funds, providing a clear audit trail for all transactions. At all times the fund must contain monies representing the institutional capital contribution. The school must at all times maintain all monies relating to the fund in one or more interest-bearing accounts or investment instruments which meet OMB requirements established for Federal monies held by third parties, except that if the school documents that the costs associated with the use of an interest-bearing account would exceed expected earnings, the school is not required to maintain these monies in an interest-bearing account. The school must place all earnings into the fund but may first deduct from total earnings any reasonable and customary charges incurred through the use of an interest-bearing account. An institution shall exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary with regard to these deposits and investments, and shall be responsible for reimbursing the fund for any losses that occur due to the use of investments that are not federally insured.

        (1) The Federal capital contribution fund is to be used by the school only for:

        (i) Nursing student loans to full-time or half-time students;

        (ii) Capital distribution as provided in section 839 of the Act or as agreed to by the school and the Secretary; and

        (iii) Costs of litigation, costs associated with membership in credit bureaus, and to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of nursing student loans.

        (2) A school must review the balance in the fund on at least a semi-annual basis to determine whether the fund balance compared with projected levels of expenditures and collections exceeds its needs. A school in closing status must review the balance in the fund on a quarterly basis. Monies identified as in excess of the school's needs must be reported, and the Federal share returned to the Federal Government, by the due date of the required report which identifies the excess monies. The school's determination is subject to the review and approval of the Secretary.

        (b)  (1) Each Federal capital loan is subject to the terms of the promissory note executed by an authorized official on behalf of the borrowing school.

        (2) The Federal capital loans must be carried in a special account of the school, to be used by the school only for: (i) Repayments of principal and interest on Federal capital loans; and (ii) costs of litigation, costs associated with membership in credit bureaus, and, to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of nursing student loans.

        (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of § 57.318 and the Department's Claims Collections regulations (45 CFR part 30), as appropriate.

        § 57.306   Eligibility and selection of nursing student loan applicants.

#### § § 57.306

        (a)  (1) Applicants are eligible for consideration for a nursing student loan if they are:

        (i) Residents of the United States and either a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, a citizen of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a citizen of the Republic of Palau, a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia;

        (ii) Enrolled, or accepted for enrollment in the school as full-time or half-time students;

        (iii) In need of the amount of the loan to pursue the course of study at the school; and

        (iv) Capable, in the opinion of the school, of maintaining good standing in the course of study.

        (2) An applicant who has previously attended an institution of higher education must submit a financial aid transcript which includes at least the following data:

        (i) Applicant's name and social security number;

        (ii) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by the applicant for study at an institution of higher education;

        (iii) Whether the applicant is in default on any of these loans, or owes a refund on any grants;

        (iv) Certification from each institution previously attended by the applicant that the applicant has received no financial aid, if applicable; and

        (v) From each institution previously attended, the signature of an official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on behalf of the institution.

        (b)  The school will select qualified applicants, make reasonable determinations of need, and determine the amount of student loans.

        (1) In selecting nursing student loan applicants the school will give preference to licensed practical nurses, and to persons with exceptional financial need. For purposes of this preference, a student will be considered to demonstrate exceptional financial need if the school determines that the student's resources, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, do not exceed one-half of the costs of attendance at the school. Summer earnings, educational loans, veterans (G.I.) benefits, earnings during the school year, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) will not be considered as resources in determining whether an applicant meets these criteria for exceptional financial need, but will be considered in determining the amount of funds a student may receive.

        (2) In determining whether a student is in need of a nursing student loan to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at the school, the school will take into consideration:

        (i) The financial resources available to the student by using one of the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by the Secretary of Education in combination with other information which the school has regarding the student's financial status; and

        (ii) The costs reasonably necessary for the student's attendance at the school, including any special needs and obligations which directly affect the student's financial ability to attend the school on a full-time or half-time basis. The school must document the criteria used for determining these costs.

        (c)  The school must verify, to the best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the loan application. To comply with this requirement, a school may require that a student provide, for example: Photocopies of the parents', student's, and spouse's Federal income tax forms with original signatures for the most recent tax year (or certification that no Federal income tax return was filed); tax returns that are certified as having been received by the Internal Revenue Service; or other documentation that the school considers necessary to help assure that information on the loan application is correct.

        § 57.307   Maximum amount of nursing student loans.

#### § § 57.307

        The total of the nursing student loans made from the fund to any student for an academic year may not exceed $2,500, except that for each of the final 2 academic years of the program, the total must not exceed $4,000. The maximum amount loaned during a 12-month period to any student enrolled in a school which provides a course of study longer than the 9-month academic year may be proportionately increased. The total of all nursing student loans to any student must not exceed $13,000.

        § 57.308   Nursing student loan promissory note.

#### § § 57.308

        (a)  Each nursing student loan must be evidenced by a properly executed promissory note in a form approved by the Secretary. The school must safeguard the promissory note against fire, theft, and tampering.

        (1) Each promissory note must state that the loan will bear interest on the unpaid balance computed only for periods during which repayment of the loan is required, at the rate of 5 percent per year.

        (2) Each promissory note must contain an acceleration clause provided by the Secretary, which will permit the acceleration of delinquent loans at the school's option.

        (3) A copy of each executed note must be supplied by the school to the student borrower.

        (b)  A school must require security or endorsement if the borrower is a minor and if, under the applicable State law, the note signed by him or her would not create a binding obligation. The school may not require security or endorsement in any other circumstances.

> [50 FR 34434, Aug. 23, 1985, as amended at 56 FR 13771, Apr. 4, 1991; 57 FR 45735, Oct. 5, 1992]

        § 57.309   Payment of nursing student loans.

#### § § 57.309

        (a) Nursing student loans from any fund may be paid to or on behalf of student borrowers in installments considered appropriate by the school except that a school may not pay to or on behalf of any borrower more during any given installment period (e.g., semester, term, or quarter) than the school determines the student needs for that period.

        (b) No payment may be made from a fund to or on behalf of any student borrower if at the time of the payment the borrower is not a full-time or half-time student.

        § 57.310   Repayment and collection of nursing student loans.

#### § § 57.310

        (a) Each nursing student loan, including accrued interest, will be repayable in equal or graduated periodic installments in amounts calculated on the basis of a 10-year repayment period. Repayment of a loan must begin 9 months after the student ceases to be a full-time or half-time student, except that if a borrower reenters the same or another school as a full-time or half-time student within the 9-month period, the date upon which interest will accrue and the repayment period will begin will be determined by the date upon which the student last ceases to be a full-time or half-time student at that school.

        (1) The following periods will be excluded from the 10-year repayment period: (i) All periods up to a total of 3 years of active duty performed by the borrower as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps or the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps;

        (ii) All periods up to a total of 3 years of service as a volunteer under the Peace Corps Act; and

        (iii) All periods up to a total of 10 years during which the borrower is pursuing a full-time or half-time course of study at a school leading to a baccalaureate degree in nursing or an equivalent degree, or to a graduate degree in nursing, or is otherwise pursuing advanced professional training in nursing (or training to be a nurse anesthetist). For purposes of this paragraph, “otherwise pursuing advanced professional training in nursing” shall include full-time or half-time training, beyond the first diploma or degree in nursing received by the particular borrower, of at least 1 academic year which will advance the borrower's knowledge of and strengthen his or her skills in the provision of nursing services.

        (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a borrower must establish a repayment schedule with the school providing for payments not less often than quarterly. Any borrower whose repayment becomes more than 60 days past due must be placed on a monthly repayment schedule by the school. A borrower may at his or her option and without penalty, prepay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any time.

        (3) A school may grant forbearance whenever extraordinary circumstances such as unemployment, poor health or other personal problems temporarily affect the borrower's ability to make scheduled loan repayments.

        (b)  (1) Each school at which a fund is established must exercise due diligence in the collection of nursing student loans due the fund. In the exercise of due diligence, a school must follow procedures which are at least as extensive and effective as those used in the collection of other student loan accounts due the school, and must use the steps outlined below in accordance with collection practices which are generally accepted among institutions of higher education:

        (i) Conduct and document an entrance interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower prior to disbursing NSL funds in any academic year. During the entrance interview the school must obtain documentation which indicates that the borrower is aware of the rights and responsibilities associated with NSL funds and personal information which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. The requirement of this subparagraph may be met by correspondence if the school determines that a face-to-face meeting (individually or in groups) is impracticable.

        (ii) Conduct and document an exit interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower. During the exit interview, the school must provide each borrower with information necessary to carry out the terms of repayment, remind the borrower of the rights and responsibilities associated with NSL funds, and update the personal information collected prior to disbursing NSL funds which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. If the borrower terminates studies without advance notice, the school must document attempts to inform the borrower of the substance of the exit interview and to secure exit interview information from the borrower by mail.

        (iii) Notify the borrower in writing of the impending repayment obligation at least twice during the grace period;

        (iv) Notify a borrower who is in deferment status in writing of the impending repayment obligation 1 to 3 months prior to the expiration of the approved period of deferment;

        (v) Perform regular billing;

        (vi) Follow up past due payments with a series of at least four documented and reasonably spaced attempts to contact the borrower, at least three of which must be in writing at not more than 30-day intervals, prior to the loan becoming 120 days past due, provided that the school has a current address for the borrower;

        (vii) Perform address searches when necessary;

        (viii) Use collection agents, which may include the use of an internal collection agent;

        (ix) Institute legal proceedings against borrowers after all other attempts at collection have failed, unless the school determines, subject to the approval of the Secretary, that such litigation would not be cost-effective; and

        (x) Become a member of a credit bureau and notify the credit bureau of accounts past due by more than 120 days.

        (2)  (i) For any nursing student loan made after June 30, 1969, but prior to October 1, 1985, the school may fix a charge for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under section 836(b)(2) of the Act, or cancellation or repayment under section 836(b)(3) of the Act, for any failure to file timely and satisfactory evidence of the entitlement. The amount of the charge may not exceed $1 for the first month or part of a month by which the installment or evidence is late and $2 for each succeeding month or part of a month. The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the day after the day on which the installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no later than the due date of the next installment following receipt of the notice of the charge by the borrower.

        (ii) For any nursing student loan made on or after October 1, 1985, the school shall assess a charge for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when the loan is more than 60 days past due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under section 836(b)(2) of the Act, for any failure to file satisfactory evidence of the entitlement within 60 days of the date payment would otherwise be due. No charge may be made if the loan is less than 61 days past due. The amount of this charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount due at the time the charge is calculated. The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the day on which the charge is calculated, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no later than the due date of the next installment following receipt of the notice of the charge by the borrower.

        (3) With respect to any nursing student loan made after June 30, 1969, the school may require the borrower to make payments of at least $15 per month on all outstanding nursing student loans during the repayment period.

        (4) A school must, on an annual basis, review and assess the collectibility of any loan more than 3 years past due. If the school determines that the prospects of future collection are promising enough to justify periodic review of the debt, and neither the statute of limitations nor the 10-year repayment period has expired, the school may retain the account for continued collections, provided that it makes an attempt at least semi-annually to collect from the borrower. When the due diligence procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been exhausted, the school is responsible for determining the collection methods it will use for the semi-annual collection effort required on these loans. If the school determines that the prospects of future collection are not promising, or when the statute of limitations or the 10-year repayment period has expired, the loan must be considered uncollectible. A school may determine a loan to be uncollectible sooner than 3 years past due when it has evidence that the loan cannot be collected, but in no case should a school consider a loan as uncollectible if it has not been in default for at least 120 days. A school is not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and (iii) of this section for loans that became uncollectible, as determined by the school, before January 1, 1983.

        (i) A school must request permission to write off an uncollectible loan within 30 days of the determination that it is uncollectible or reimburse the fund in the full amount of the loan, pursuant to § 57.310(b)(4)(iii). The 30-day period for submitting the loan for write-off review begins on the date that the determination of uncollectibility is made, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In any instance where the Secretary determines that a school has failed to exercise due diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, the school will be required to place in the fund the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on the loan. Reimbursement must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less than 30 days following the Secretary's disapproval of the request for write-off approval.

        (ii) If the Secretary determines that a school has exercised due diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or if the school determines that the loan was uncollectible prior to January 1, 1983, the school will be permitted to reduce its accounts receivable for the NSL fund by the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on that loan and will not be required to return the Federal share of the loss to the Secretary.

        (iii) If a school does not request permission to write off an uncollectible loan within the required timeframe, it must reimburse the fund for the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on that loan. This reimbursement must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less than 30 days following its determination that a loan is uncollectible.

        (iv) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of § 57.318 and the Department's Claims Collection regulations (45 CFR part 30), as appropriate.

        (5)  Upon written request by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may disclose the address of any taxpayer who has defaulted on a nursing student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents of the Department, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect the loan. Any such mailing address may be disclosed by the Secretary to any school from which the defaulted borrower received a nursing student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents of the school whose duties relate to the collection of nursing student loan funds, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect the loan. Any school which requests and obtains such address information must comply with the requirements of the Secretary and the IRS regarding the safeguarding and proper handling of this information.

        (a)  The Secretary will cancel a borrower's indebtedness in accordance with section 836(b)(4) of the Act if the borrower is found to be permanently and totally disabled on recommendation of the school and as supported by whatever medical certification the Secretary may require. A borrower is totally and permanently disabled if he or she is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a medically determinable impairment, which the Secretary expects to continue for a long time or to result in death.

        (b)  The Secretary will cancel a borrower's indebtedness in accordance with section 836(b)(4) of the Act upon the death of the borrower. The school to which the borrower was indebted must secure a certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under State law.

        (b) An applicant will be considered to be in exceptionally needy circumstances if, upon comparison of the income and other financial resources of the applicant with his or her expenses and financial obligations, the Secretary determines that repayment of the loan would constitute a serious economic burden on the applicant. In making this determination, the Secretary will take into consideration the applicant's net financial assets, his or her potential earning capacity, and the relationship of the income available to the applicant to the low-income levels published annually by the Secretary in the ;

        (c) An applicant will be considered as not having resumed his or her nursing studies within 2 years following the date the individual ceased to be a student upon certification so stating from the applicant; and

        (d) An applicant will be considered as not reasonably expected to resume his or her nursing studies within 2 years following the date upon which he or she terminated these studies, based upon consideration of the reasons for the applicant's failure to complete these studies, taking into account such factors as academic, medical, or financial difficulties. The Secretary will only repay education loans made after November 17, 1971.

#### § § 57.316

        Participating schools are advised that in addition to complying with the terms and conditions of these regulations, several other regulations apply under this subpart. These include, but are not limited to:

> [56 FR 13772, Apr. 4, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 45735, Oct. 5, 1992; 61 FR 6123, Feb. 16, 1996]

        § 57.316a   Performance standard.

#### § § 57.316a

        On June 30, 1986, and on each June 30 thereafter, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each school must have a default rate (as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section) of not more than 5 percent.

        (a) The default rate for each school shall be the ratio (stated as a percentage) that the defaulted principal amount outstanding of the school bears to the matured loans of the school. For this purpose:

        (1) The term “defaulted principal amount outstanding” means the total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or canceled) on loans in default for more than 120 days; and

        (2) The term “matured loans” means the total principal amount of all loans made by a school under this subpart minus the total principal amount of loans made by the school to students who are:

        (i) Enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at the school; or

        (ii) In their grace period.

        (b) Any school that has a default rate greater than 5 percent on June 30, 1986, or on June 30 of any year thereafter will be required to:

        (1) Reduce its default rate by 50 percent (or a school with a default rate below 10 percent must reduce its rate to 5 percent) by the close of the following 6-month period; and

        (2) By the end of each succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default rate to 50 percent of the required rate for the previous 6-month period, until it reaches 5 percent.

        (c) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section which fails to comply with those requirements will receive no new NSL funds and will be required to:

        (1) Place the revolving fund monies and all subsequent collections into an insured interest-bearing account;

        (2) Make no loan disbursements; and

        (3) By the end of the succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default rate to 50 percent of the rate it failed to achieve under paragraph (b) of this section, or 5 percent. A school that meets this requirement will be permitted to resume the use of its nursing student loan funds, but must continue to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section if its default rate is still greater than 5 percent.

        (d) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section which fails to comply with those requirements will be subject to termination. The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:

        (1) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 30-day requirement);

        (2) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or

        (3) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.

        § 57.317   Additional conditions.

#### § § 57.317

        The Secretary may, with respect to any agreement entered into with any school under § 57.305, impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of any award when in his or her judgment the conditions are necessary to assure or protect advancement of the purposes of the agreement, the interest of the public health, or the conservation of funds awarded.

        § 57.318   Noncompliance.

#### § § 57.318

        Whenever the Secretary finds that a participating school has failed to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act or the regulations of this subpart he or she may, on reasonable notice to the school, withhold further payments of Federal capital contributions and take other action, including the termination of any agreement, as he or she finds necessary to enforce the Act and regulations. In such case no further expenditures shall be made from the nursing student loan fund or funds involved until the Secretary determines that there is no longer any failure of compliance.

#### § § 57.409

        If, within 20 years after completion of construction (or, in the case of interim facilities prior to the time at which teaching in such facilities is moved to a permanent facility, whichever comes first), the facility shall cease to be used for any one or more of the purposes for which it was constructed, the Secretary, in determining whether there is good cause for releasing the applicant or other owner of the facility from the obligation so to use the facility, shall take into consideration the extent to which:

        (a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to the teaching of other health personnel;

        (b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of such period other facilities not previously utilized for nurse training will be so utilized and are substantially the equivalent in nature and extent for such purposes.

#### § § 57.1507

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may in particular cases guarantee loans in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section where he determines that, because of special circumstances, such additional loan guarantee will further the purposes of part B of title VII of the Act. In making such determinations, the Secretary will in each case consider the following factors:

#### § § 57.1508

        The length of time for which interest subsidy payments will be made under the agreement, the amount of loan with respect to which such payments will be made, and the level of such payments shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the availability of funds and his determination of the applicant's need therefor taking into consideration his analysis of the present and reasonable projected future financial ability of the applicant to repay the principal and interest of the loan without jeopardizing the quality of its educational program:  That each such interest subsidy payment shall not exceed the amount necessary to reduce by 3 percent per annum the net effective interest rate otherwise payable on the loan or the portion thereof with respect to which such interest subsidy is paid.

        (b) The Secretary may, in particular cases where he determines that, because of unusual circumstances, the applicant would be financially unable to amortize the loan over a repayment period of 30 years, approve a longer requirement period which shall in no case exceed 40 years; and

        (c) In no case shall a loan repayment period exceed the useful life of the facility to be constructed with the assistance of the loan.

        § 57.1513   Repayment.

#### § § 57.1513

        Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Secretary, each loan with respect to which a guarantee is made or interest subsidies are paid shall be repayable in substantially level total annual installments of principal and interest, sufficient to amortize the loan through the final year of the life of the loan.

#### § § 57.1514

        For each application for a loan guarantee or interest subsidy, or combination thereof, which is approved by the Secretary under this subpart, an offer to guarantee such loan and/or make interest subsidy payments with respect thereto will be sent to the applicant, setting forth the pertinent terms and conditions for the loan guarantee and/or interest subsidy, and will be conditioned upon the fulfillment of such terms and conditions.

        (2) That the applicant shall be permitted to prepay up to 15 percent of the original principal amount of such loan in any calendar year without additional charge. The applicant and the lender may further agree that the applicant shall be permitted to prepay in excess of 15 percent of the original amount of the loan in any calendar year without additional charge, but no such payment in excess of 15 percent shall be made without the prior written approval of the Secretary.

        (3) That if the applicant shall default in making periodic payment, when due, of the principal and interest on the loan guaranteed under the agreement, the holder of the loan shall promptly give the Secretary written notification of such default.

The Secretary shall pay such amount from funds available to him for these purposes.

        (5) That in the event of exercise by the holder of the loan of any right to accelerate payment of such loan as a result of the applicants default in making periodic payment when due of the principal and interest on the guaranteed loan, the Secretary shall, upon demand by the holder not less than 90 days after receipt by the Secretary of notification of such default, pay to such holder 90 percent of the total amount of principal and of interest on the loan remaining unpaid after the holder has exercised his right to foreclose upon and dispose of the security and has applied the proceeds thereby received to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan, in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the security instrument.

Pursuant to such written notification of transfer, the Secretary will make such interest payments directly to the new holder (transferee) of the loan:  That it shall be the responsibility of the holder to remit any payments of interest subsidy to the new holder which the Secretary may have made to the holder after such transfer and prior to receipt of such written notice, and the Secretary shall not be liable to any party for amounts remitted to the holder prior to receipt of such written notice and acknowledgment in writing by the Secretary of receipt of such notice.

        (3) That the holder of the loan will promptly notify the Secretary of any default or prepayment by the applicant with respect to the loan.

        (6) Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined, after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 45 CFR part 83, that the Assurance executed by the applicant under section 704 (or its predecessor, section 799A) of the Act, is no longer satisfactory, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease:  That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he determines that a subsequent Assurance submitted by the applicant is satisfactory.

        (7) Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined by the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 45 CFR parts 80 and 81, that the applicant has ceased to comply with the Assurance it has executed under 45 CFR 80.4(d) concerning nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease:  That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he subsequently determines that the applicant has come into compliance with the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and implementing regulations.

        (8) Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined by the Secretary after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, that the applicant has ceased to comply with such title, and its implementing regulations, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease:  That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he subsequently determines that the applicant has come into compliance with the requirements of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and implementing regulations.

        (c)  In addition to the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, each agreement, whether pertaining to a loan guarantee or interest subsidy or both, shall contain such other provisions as the Secretary finds necessary in order to protect the financial interests of the United States.

        (b) A hospital or outpatient facility will be used as provided for under title VI of the act;

        (c) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of the repayment period of the loan other facilities not previously utilized for the purpose for which the facility was constructed will be so utilized and are substantially equivalent in nature and extent for such purposes; and

        (d) Such recovery would seriously curtail the training of qualified health professions personnel in the area served by the facility.

        § 57.1518   Modification of loans.

#### § § 57.1518

        No official of the Department of Health and Human Services will approve any proposal to modify the terms of a loan guaranteed under title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 293 ) and this subpart which would permit the use of the guaranteed loan (or the guarantee) as collateral for an issue of tax-exempt securities.

        (1) In the case of any individual selected pursuant to § 57.2205(a) (1) or (2), such practice must be in the physician shortage area to which such individual agreed to return:  That if the Secretary determines at the time the individual proposes to engage in the required practice that such area is no longer a physician shortage area and cannot reasonably be expected to become such an area within 2 years from such time, such practice shall, at the option of the individual, be either in any then current physician shortage area, or in such place or places, facility, or facilities, and in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families.

        (2) In the case of any individual selected pursuant to § 57.2205(a) (3) or (4), such practice must be in accordance with the agreement described in § 57.2205(b)(2) (, in a physician shortage area with a substantial portion of migratory agricultural workers in such area; a physician shortage area; or in such place or places, facility or facilities, and in such manner as may be necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families; as the case may be).

        (d) Where an individual has received scholarship grant support for four academic years, such individual shall be considered to have received scholarship grant support for only three academic years if the Secretary determines (1) that such individual has served his internship or residency in a hospital (i) which is located in a physician shortage area, or (ii) in which a substantial portion of the patients of such hospital consists of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of the families of such workers and (2) that while so serving such internship or residency, he has received training or professional experience designed to prepare him to engage in the practice of primary care.

        (f) No individual who has received a scholarship grant under this subpart may enter into an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to section 741(f) of the Act until either (1) such individual has completed the practice required by paragraph (a) of this section, or (2) the Secretary has determined that the United States is entitled to recover from such individual an amount determined in accordance with § 57.2210. In no case, however, shall a scholarship grant under this subpart be considered an educational loan for purposes of section 741(f) of the Act.

#### § § 57.2211

        (a) Any obligation of any individual under this subpart will be cancelled upon the death of such individual as documented by a certification of death, or such other official proof as is conclusive under State law, and submitted to the Secretary.

        (b) Subject to the provision of paragraph (f) of this section, where an individual fails to complete the practice required by § 57.2209(a) within the period prescribed in § 57.2209(b), the Secretary may waive or suspend for such period as determined by the Secretary the obligation of such individual to repay pursuant to § 57.2210 where the Secretary determines that compliance by such individual with such obligation (1) is impossible, or (2) would involve extreme hardship to such individual and enforcement of such obligation with respect to such individual would be against equity and good conscience.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, compliance by an individual will be deemed impossible where the Secretary determines, on the basis of such information and documentation as he may require, that the individual is permanently and totally disabled.

        (d) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether compliance by an individual would involve extreme hardship to such individual and would be against equity and good conscience, the Secretary will take into consideration the following:

        (1) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;

        (2) The individual's estimated future financial resources and obligations;

        (3) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete such practice within the prescribed period, such as problems of a personal nature; and

        (4) The extent to which the individual is practicing his profession in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 784 of the Act.

        (e) Where the Secretary determines that compliance by an individual with his obligation to engage in the practice of primary care in a specified shortage area pursuant to § 57.2209(a) is impossible or would involve extreme hardship to such individual and enforcement of such obligation with respect to such individual would be against equity and good conscience, the Secretary may waive such obligation and permit the individual at his option to practice either in any then current physician shortage area, or in such place or places, facility or facilities, and in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families. The Secretary will take into consideration in determining whether to grant a waiver under this paragraph the extent to which the individual has problems of a personal nature, e.g., physical or mental disability, terminal illness in the family, or need for financial support that cannot be supplied by the required service, which intrude upon the individual's ability to perform the required service in the specified shortage area.

        (f) The Secretary may extend the period (prescribed in § 57.2209(b)) within which an individual must complete the practice required pursuant to § 57.2209(a) for a period not to exceed one year where the Secretary finds that (1) such individual is unable to complete such practice within such period because of a temporary physical or mental disability, or (2) completion by such individual of such practice within such period would involve extreme hardship to such individual and that failure to so extend such period would be against equity and good conscience.

These programs are referred to herein as the “scholarship programs.” The regulations apply to increases in tuition and other educational costs occurring after the school year beginning immediately before October 1, 1981.

> [57 FR 45745, Oct. 5, 1992]

        § 57.3202   How will allowable increases be determined?

#### § § 57.3202

        (a) The Secretary is responsible for increases in tuition and other educational costs only if the same increase is charged to all students in the same category (for example, the same class year or place of residence) and without regard to whether the student is receiving support under the scholarship programs. A student participating in the scholarship programs may not be denied eligibility because of this participation for any discounts or rebates in tuition or other educational costs given to all other students in the same category at the institution.

        (b) Institutions whose enrollment contains 25 percent or more students participating in the scholarship programs, and whose percentage increase in tuition and other educational costs in any school year exceeds the previous calendar year's average inflation rate as indicated by the  may be requested to provide the Secretary with detailed cost breakdowns justifying the increase.

        (c) In the case of a school which is requested to provide the Secretary with cost increase justification under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will be responsible for increases in tuition and other educational costs charged to students participating in the scholarship programs over the amount charged for the school year immediately preceding the increase only to the extent that they are: (1) Attributable to uncontrollable costs, such as fuel costs, mandated cost-of-living increases in wages, salaries and fringe benefits, (2) attributable to costs of maintaining and improving the quality of the health professions education provided by the institution, such as hiring additional faculty to improve the faculty-student ratio, costs incurred in off-site training of students, and necessary improvements in teaching equipment. Increases in patient care and research costs are allowable as part of an increase in tuition and other educational costs only to the extent that they can be documented as clearly necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the education being supported; or (3) attributable to loss of revenue from other sources which was used solely for the maintenance and improvement of the educational system.

        (d) If the Secretary, after reviewing all available data, information, and justifications submitted by an institution, determines that an increase in tuition and other educational costs is not allowable under the criteria described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the Secretary will provide the affected institution a detailed written explanation of the basis of that determination. The Secretary will be responsible for that portion of tuition and other educational costs the Secretary determines to be allowable.

        § 59.1   To what programs do these regulations apply?

#### § § 59.1

        The regulations of this subpart are applicable to the award of grants under section 1001 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300) to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects. These projects shall consist of the educational, comprehensive medical, and social services necessary to aid individuals to determine freely the number and spacing of their children.

        § 59.2   Definitions.

#### § § 59.2

        § 59.3   Who is eligible to apply for a family planning services grant?

#### § § 59.3

        Any public or nonprofit private entity in a State may apply for a grant under this subpart.

        § 59.4   How does one apply for a family planning services grant?

#### § § 59.4

        (a) Application for a grant under this subpart shall be made on an authorized form.

        (b) An individual authorized to act for the applicant and to assume on behalf of the applicant the obligations imposed by the terms and conditions of the grant, including the regulations of this subpart, must sign the application.

        (c) The application shall contain

        (1) A description, satisfactory to the Secretary, of the project and how it will meet the requirements of this subpart;

        (2) A budget and justification of the amount of grant funds requested;

        (3) A description of the standards and qualifications which will be required for all personnel and for all facilities to be used by the project; and

        (4) Such other pertinent information as the Secretary may require.

        § 59.5   What requirements must be met by a family planning project?

#### § § 59.5

        (a) Each project supported under this part must:

        (1) Provide a broad range of acceptable and effective medically approved family planning methods (including natural family planning methods) and services (including pregnancy testing and counseling, assistance to achieve pregnancy, basic infertility services, STI services, preconception health services, and adolescent-friendly health services). If an organization offers only a single method of family planning, it may participate as part of a project as long as the entire project offers a broad range of acceptable and effective medically approved family planning methods and services. Title X service sites that are unable to provide clients with access to a broad range of acceptable and effective medically approved family planning methods and services, must be able to provide a prescription to the client for their method of choice or referrals to another provider, as requested.

        (2) Provide services without subjecting individuals to any coercion to accept services or to employ or not to employ any particular methods of family planning. Acceptance of services must be solely on a voluntary basis and may not be made a prerequisite to eligibility for, or receipt of, any other services, assistance from or participation in any other program of the applicant.

        (3) Provide services in a manner that is client-centered, culturally and linguistically appropriate, inclusive, and trauma-informed; protects the dignity of the individual; and ensures equitable and quality service delivery consistent with nationally recognized standards of care.

        (4) Provide services in a manner that does not discriminate against any client based on religion, race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, number of pregnancies, or marital status.

        (5) Not provide abortion as a method of family planning.  A project must:

        (i) Offer pregnant clients the opportunity to be provided information and counseling regarding each of the following options:

        (A) Prenatal care and delivery;

        (B) Infant care, foster care, or adoption; and

        (C) Pregnancy termination.

        (ii) If requested to provide such information and counseling, provide neutral, factual information and nondirective counseling on each of the options, and, referral upon request, except with respect to any option(s) about which the pregnant client indicates they do not wish to receive such information and counseling.

        (6) Provide that priority in the provision of services will be given to clients from low-income families.

        (7) Provide that no charge will be made for services provided to any clients from a low-income family except to the extent that payment will be made by a third party (including a government agency) which is authorized to or is under legal obligation to pay this charge.

        (8) Provide that charges will be made for services to clients other than those from low-income families in accordance with a schedule of discounts based on ability to pay, except that charges to persons from families whose annual income exceeds 250 percent of the levels set forth in the most recent Poverty Guidelines issued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2) will be made in accordance with a schedule of fees designed to recover the reasonable cost of providing services.

        (i) Family income should be assessed before determining whether copayments or additional fees are charged.

        (ii) With regard to insured clients, clients whose family income is at or below 250 percent of the FPL should not pay more (in copayments or additional fees) than what they would otherwise pay when the schedule of discounts is applied.

        (9) Take reasonable measures to verify client income, without burdening clients from low-income families. Recipients that have lawful access to other valid means of income verification because of the client's participation in another program may use those data rather than re-verify income or rely solely on clients' self-report. If a client's income cannot be verified after reasonable attempts to do so, charges are to be based on the client's self-reported income.

        (10) If a third party (including a Government agency) is authorized or legally obligated to pay for services, all reasonable efforts must be made to obtain the third-party payment without application of any discounts. Where the cost of services is to be reimbursed under title XIX, XX, or XXI of the Social Security Act, a written agreement with the title XIX, XX, or XXI agency is required.

        (11)(i) Provide that if an application relates to consolidation of service areas or health resources or would otherwise affect the operations of local or regional entities, the applicant must document that these entities have been given, to the maximum feasible extent, an opportunity to participate in the development of the application. Local and regional entities include existing or potential subrecipients which have previously provided or propose to provide family planning services to the area proposed to be served by the applicant.

        (ii) Provide an opportunity for maximum participation by existing or potential subrecipients in the ongoing policy decision making of the project.

        (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, each project must meet each of the following requirements unless the Secretary determines that the project has established good cause for its omission. Each project must:

        (1) Provide for medical services related to family planning (including consultation by a clinical services provider, examination, prescription and continuing supervision, laboratory examination, contraceptive supplies), in person or via telehealth, and necessary referral to other medical facilities when medically indicated, and provide for the effective usage of contraceptive devices and practices.

        (2) Provide for social services related to family planning, including counseling, referral to and from other social and medical service agencies, and any ancillary services which may be necessary to facilitate clinic attendance.

        (3) Provide for opportunities for community education, participation, and engagement to:

        (i) Achieve community understanding of the objectives of the program;

        (ii) Inform the community of the availability of services; and

        (iii) Promote continued participation in the project by diverse persons to whom family planning services may be beneficial to ensure access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality family planning services.

        (4) Provide for orientation and in-service training for all project personnel.

        (5) Provide services without the imposition of any durational residency requirement or requirement that the patient be referred by a physician.

        (6) Provide that family planning medical services will be performed under the direction of a clinical services provider, with services offered within their scope of practice and allowable under state law, and with special training or experience in family planning.

        (7) Provide that all services purchased for project participants will be authorized by the project director or their designee on the project staff.

        (8) Provide for coordination and use of referrals and linkages with primary healthcare providers, other providers of healthcare services, local health and welfare departments, hospitals, voluntary agencies, and health services projects supported by other federal programs, who are in close physical proximity to the Title X site, when feasible, in order to promote access to services and provide a seamless continuum of care.

        (9) Provide that if family planning services are provided by contract or other similar arrangements with actual providers of services, services will be provided in accordance with a plan which establishes rates and method of payment for medical care. These payments must be made under agreements with a schedule of rates and payment procedures maintained by the recipient. The recipient must be prepared to substantiate that these rates are reasonable and necessary.

        (10) Provide, to the maximum feasible extent, an opportunity for participation in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the project by persons broadly representative of all significant elements of the population to be served, and by others in the community knowledgeable about the community's needs for family planning services.

        § 59.6   What procedures apply to assure the suitability of informational and educational material (print and electronic)?

#### § § 59.6

        (a) A grant under this section may be made only upon assurance satisfactory to the Secretary that the project shall provide for the review and approval of informational and educational materials (print and electronic) developed or made available under the project by an Advisory Committee prior to their distribution, to assure that the materials are suitable for the population or community to which they are to be made available and the purposes of Title X of the Act. The project shall not disseminate any such materials which are not approved by the Advisory Committee.

        (b) The Advisory Committee referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be established as follows:

        (1)  The committee shall consist of no fewer than five members and up to as many members the recipient determines, except that this provision may be waived by the Secretary for good cause shown.

        (2)  The committee shall include individuals broadly representative of the population or community for which the materials are intended (in terms of demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, age, marital status, income, geography, and including but not limited to individuals who belong to underserved communities, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality).

        (3)  In reviewing materials, the Advisory Committee shall:

        (i) Consider the educational, cultural, and diverse backgrounds of individuals to whom the materials are addressed;

        (ii) Consider the standards of the population or community to be served with respect to such materials;

        (iii) Review the content of the material to assure that the information is factually correct, medically accurate, culturally and linguistically appropriate, inclusive, and trauma informed;

        (iv) Determine whether the material is suitable for the population or community to which is to be made available; and

        (v) Establish a written record of its determinations.

        § 59.7   What criteria will the Department of Health and Human Services use to decide which family planning services projects to fund and in what amount?

#### § § 59.7

        (a) Within the limits of funds available for these purposes, the Secretary may award grants for the establishment and operation of those projects which will in the Department's judgment best promote the purposes of section 1001 of the Act, taking into account:

        (1) The number of clients, and, in particular, the number of low-income clients to be served;

        (2) The extent to which family planning services are needed locally;

        (3) The ability of the applicant to advance health equity;

        (4) The relative need of the applicant;

        (5) The capacity of the applicant to make rapid and effective use of the federal assistance;

        (6) The adequacy of the applicant's facilities and staff;

        (7) The relative availability of non-federal resources within the community to be served and the degree to which those resources are committed to the project; and

        (8) The degree to which the project plan adequately provides for the requirements set forth in these regulations.

        (b) The Secretary shall determine the amount of any award on the basis of an estimate of the sum necessary for the performance of the project. No grant may be made for less than 90 percent of the project's costs, as so estimated, unless the grant is to be made for a project which was supported, under section 1001, for less than 90 percent of its costs in fiscal year 1975. In that case, the grant shall not be for less than the percentage of costs covered by the grant in fiscal year 1975.

        (c) No grant may be made for an amount equal to 100 percent for the project's estimated costs.

        § 59.8   How is a grant awarded?

#### § § 59.8

        (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This anticipated period will usually be for three to five years.

        (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A recipient must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the recipient's progress and management practices and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of the government.

        (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

        § 59.9   For what purpose may grant funds be used?

#### § § 59.9

        Any funds granted under this subpart shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this subpart, the terms and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles prescribed in 45 CFR part 75.

        § 59.10   Confidentiality.

#### § § 59.10

        (a) All information as to personal facts and circumstances obtained by the project staff about individuals receiving services must be held confidential and must not be disclosed without the individual's documented consent, except as may be necessary to provide services to the patient or as required by law, with appropriate safeguards for confidentiality. Otherwise, information may be disclosed only in summary, statistical, or other form which does not identify particular individuals. Reasonable efforts to collect charges without jeopardizing client confidentiality must be made. Recipient must inform the client of any potential for disclosure of their confidential health information to policyholders where the policyholder is someone other than the client.

        (b) To the extent practical, Title X projects shall encourage family participation.  However, Title X projects may not require consent of parents or guardians for the provision of services to minors, nor can any Title X project staff notify a parent or guardian before or after a minor has requested and/or received Title X family planning services.

        § 59.11   Additional conditions.

#### § § 59.11

        The Secretary may, with respect to any grant, impose additional conditions prior to, at the time of, or during any award, when in the Department's judgment these conditions are necessary to assure or protect advancement of the approved program, the interests of public health, or the proper use of grant funds.

#### § § 59.206

        (a) Within the limits of funds available for such purpose, the Secretary may award grants to assist in the establishment and operation of those projects which will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 1003 of the Act, taking into account:

        (1) The extent to which a training program will increase the delivery of services to people, particularly low-income groups, with a high percentage of unmet need for family planning services;

Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary.

        (c) Allowability of costs shall be in conformance with the applicable cost principles prescribed by 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

        (d) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.

        (a)  The Secretary, with the advice of the Board in each case, shall award grants to those applicants whose arrangements and proposed services will, in the Secretary's judgment, have the greatest potential for fulfilling the need for a regional medical library. The Secretary, in determining the priority assigned an applicant, must consider:

        (1) The adequacy of the applicant's library in terms of collections, personnel, equipment, and other facilities; and

        (2) The size and nature of the population to be served in the applicant's region.

        Although the Secretary may approve exceptions which are consistent with program purposes, in addition to other terms, conditions, and assurances required by law, each grantee must meet the following requirements:

        (a)  Any funds granted under this subpart shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds were granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this subpart, the terms and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles in 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

        (b) —(1)  The grantee shall modify and increase its library resources to provide supportive services to other health-sciences informational activities.

        (2)  The grantee shall provide free loan services to qualified users or, in lieu of loans, make available photoduplicated or facsimile copies of biomedical materials which qualified requesters may retain. Reasonable fees may be charged for copies or other services (other than free loan services) provided by a grantee under this subpart:  That equal access to the health-information resources of the region or of the national network is assured. These fees shall be designed to recover expenses. The grantee's access policies shall determine the qualifications of individuals or organizations for access to the services provided under the grant, so long as those policies are consistent with the mandatory service undertakings of the program. The Secretary may review the grantee's access policies to assure compliance with this requirement.

        (b)  The Special Review Committee shall be composed of a representative of the Office of the Surgeon General designated by the Surgeon General as chairman but nonvoting member, the appropriate Associate Director or comparable official of the bureau involved, the Chief of the Division of Research Grants, the Director of the Institute or the Chief of the Division which awarded the fellowship in question, or their delegates, and two additional members appointed by the Surgeon General.

        (c)  The Committee may supplement the information referred to it by such correspondence, personal interviews, or other informal methods as necessary in order to make its recommendation as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d)  The Committee shall review the pertinent records, determine whether there is substantial reason to believe that the award should be terminated or not continued either on grounds relating to moral character or on the ground that the statement filed pursuant to § 61.5(d) was not made in good faith, and make its recommendation to the Surgeon General in writing, with reasons therefor, accordingly.

        § 61.16   Termination of or refusal to continue award on grounds relating to moral character or loyalty; hearing.

#### § § 61.16

        If, after review of the recommendation of the Special Review Committee, the Surgeon General believes that the award should be terminated or should not be continued, he shall notify the fellow and sponsoring institution in writing that unless a request for a hearing is made by the fellow within 20 days after the fellow's receipt of such notice, his fellowship will be terminated or his application for continuation of the award denied. A copy of the regulations under this subpart and a copy of part 10 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be enclosed with the notice. The notice shall set forth, as specifically as security permits, the grounds for the questions pertaining to moral character or loyalty. Any such request for a hearing shall be promptly submitted by the Surgeon General to the Chairman of the Departmental Fellowship Review Panel for handling in accordance with such part 10.

        § 61.17   Termination on grounds other than those relating to moral character or loyalty.

#### § § 61.17

        The Surgeon General may terminate a fellowship upon receipt from the fellow of a written request for termination. The Surgeon General shall terminate any fellowship prior to the date it would otherwise expire if he determines that the fellow's performance is unsatisfactory or that the fellow or the sponsoring institution is unfit or unable to carry out the purpose of the fellowship. The fellow and the sponsoring institution shall be notified in writing of such termination.

        § 61.18   Publications.

#### § § 61.18

        Publication, distribution, and disposition of all manuscripts and other materials resulting from a fellowship awarded hereunder shall be subject to the conditions that all such materials shall bear appropriate acknowledgment of Public Health Service support, that fellows shall furnish copies of such publications or other materials as may be requested by the Surgeon General, and to such other conditions as the Surgeon General may prescribe.

        § 61.19   Copyright and reproduction.

#### § § 61.19

        Where the work accomplished under a fellowship award results in a book or other copyrightable material, the author is free to copyright the work, but the Public Health Service reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, all copyrightable or copyrighted material resulting from the fellowship award.

        § 61.20   Inventions or discoveries.

#### § § 61.20

        Any fellowship award made hereunder is subject to the regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services set forth in title 45 CFR parts 6 and 8, as amended. Such regulations shall apply to any activity for which fellowship funds are in fact used, whether within the scope of the fellowship as approved or otherwise. Appropriate measures shall be taken by the fellow, the sponsoring institution, and the Surgeon General to assure that no contracts, assignments, or other arrangements inconsistent with the fellowship obligation are entered into or continued and that all personnel involved in the supported activity are aware of and comply with such obligation. Laboratory notes, related technical data and information pertaining to inventions or discoveries shall be maintained for such periods, and filed with or otherwise made available to the Surgeon General or those whom he may designate at such times and in such manner as he may determine necessary to comply with such Department regulations.

        § 61.21   Interest.

#### § § 61.21

        Any interest earned through deposit or investment by the sponsoring institution of funds paid pursuant to the provisions of this subpart shall be paid to the United States as such interest is received by the sponsoring institution.

        § 61.22   Nondiscrimination.

#### § § 61.22

        Attention is called to the fact that funds paid to a sponsoring institution pursuant to § 61.11 in order to meet the expenses of the activities of a fellow are considered Federal financial assistance to such institution. The institution is thus subject in this respect to the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin imposed by title VI, Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the implementing Regulation of the Department of Health and Human Services (45 CFR part 80).

        (b)  The Secretary will suspend scholarship payments to or on behalf of a participant if the school (1) approves a leave-of-absence for the participant for health, personal, or other reasons, or (2) requires the participant to repeat course work for which the Secretary has previously made scholarship payments under § 62.7. However, if the repeated course work does not delay the participant's graduation date, scholarship payments will continue except for any additional costs relating to the repeated course work. Any scholarship payments suspended under this paragraph will be resumed by the Secretary upon notification by the school that the participant has returned from the leave-of-absence or has completed the repeated course work and is pursuing as a full-time student the course of study for which the scholarship was awarded.

        (b)  (1) The period of obligated service will begin when the Scholarship Program participant begins to provide services in the health manpower shortage area to which he or she is assigned by the Secretary. Except for those participants who receive a deferral under § 62.9 (a) or (b), this assignment will be made by the Secretary as soon as possible following: (i) the completion of the participant's course of study leading to a degree in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, or an equivalent credential for a particular health profession, and (ii) appointment of the participant as a Commissioned Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or as a civilian member of the National Health Service Corps.

        (2) For purposes of this paragraph, “appointment” means only those appointments as Commissioned Officers in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or as civilian members of the National Health Service Corps made specifically for the purpose of serving a participant's period of obligated service.

        (c)  Except as provided in § 62.14(b)(1), the period for which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to serve is equal to 1 year for each school year for which the participant receives a scholarship award under this part, or 2 years, whichever is greater.

        (d)  If the Secretary determines that there is no need in a health manpower shortage area for a member of the profession in which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to provide service, the Scholarship Program participant may be detailed to serve the period of obligated service as a full-time member of the profession for which the participant has been trained, in any unit of the Department of Health and Human Services as the Secretary may determine.

        (e)  Except as provided in § 62.14(b)(2), no period of approved graduate training will be credited toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under the Scholarship Program.

        (f)  (1) A Scholarship Program participant who demonstrates exceptional promise for medical research may perform the period of obligated service owed under this section by participating in the National Research Service Award Program for individual postdoctoral fellows authorized under section 472 of the Act.

        (2) Exceptional promise for medical research will be demonstrated if the participant applies for a National Research Service Award for individual postdoctoral fellows, is selected to participate in this research program, and accepts the offer of participation. A Scholarship Program participant in the National Research Service Award Program will receive credit toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under this section for any period of time he or she is engaged in activities which meet the service requirements of the National Research Service Award Program.

        (3) If the time served under the National Research Service Award Program is less than the total period of obligated service owed under the Scholarship Program, the participant will serve the remainder of the Scholarship Program service obligation (i) in activities which meet the criteria for service under the National Research Service Award Program, as approved by the Secretary or (ii) as a member of the National Health Service Corps providing health services in the full-time clinical practice of his or her health profession. A participant who fails to begin or complete the service requirements under the National Research Service Award Program may be subject to the default penalty under § 62.10(c) of this part and the default penalties under the National Research Service Award Program.

        (g)  The Secretary will release a participant from all or part of the service obligation if the participant applies for a release under section 753 of the Act and agrees in writing to engage for a period equal to the remaining period of the participant's service obligation in the full-time private clinical practice of the participant's health profession, under the requirements of section 753 of the Act.

        § 62.9   Under what circumstances can the period of obligated service be deferred to complete approved graduate training?

#### § § 62.9

        (a)  Upon the request of any participant receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy, or dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy, the Secretary will defer the beginning date of the obligated service to allow the participant to complete an approved graduate training program. The period of this deferment may not exceed (1) three years for any participant receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy or dentistry, or (2) one year for any participant receiving a degree from a school of veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy. The Secretary may, however, extend this period of deferment if the Secretary determines that the extension is consistent with the needs of the National Health Service Corps.

        (b)  Each participant receiving a degree in medicine or osteopathy who does not intend to enter training which can be completed within the deferment period granted under paragraph (a) of this section must complete at least one year of approved graduate training before beginning the period of obligated service. This one year of training must be in (1) an allopathic flexible first-year program whose sponsorship includes approved residencies in family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, or a categorical first-year program in family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics; (2) a rotating internship in osteopathic medicine; or (3) such other programs as the Secretary determines provides comparable experience. Any participant receiving a degree in medicine or osteopathy who fails to complete the one year of required training or an approved graduate training program for which a deferment was granted under paragraph (a) of this section will be subject to the default penalties of § 62.10(c).

        (c)  Before altering the length or type of approved graduate training for which the period of obligated service was deferred under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the participant must request and obtain the Secretary's approval of the alteration.

        (d)  The Secretary may prescribe additional terms and conditions for deferment under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section as necessary to carry out the purposes of the Scholarship Program.

        (e)  Any participant whose period of obligated service has been deferred under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section must begin the obligated service when the participant begins to provide health services in the health manpower shortage area to which he or she is assigned by the Secretary. This assignment will be made by the Secretary as soon as possible following (1) the completion of the requested or required graduate training for which the deferment was granted, and (2) appointment as a Commissioned Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or as a civilian member of the National Health Service Corps.

        § 62.10   What will happen if an individual does not comply with the terms and conditions of participating in the scholarship program?

#### § § 62.10

        (a) If a participant, other than one described in paragraph (b) of this section, fails to accept payment or instructs the school not to accept payment of the scholarship provided by the Secretary, the participant must, in addition to any service or other obligation incurred under the contract, pay to the United States the amount of $1,500 liquidated damages. Payment of this amount must be made within 30 days of the date on which the participant fails to accept payment of the scholarship award or instructs the school not to accept payment.

        (b) When a participant fails to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing, is dismissed from the school for disciplinary reasons, or voluntarily terminates the course of study or program for which the scholarship was awarded before completing the course of study or program, the participant must, instead of performing any service obligation, pay to the United States an amount equal to all scholarship funds awarded under § 62.7. Payment of this amount must be made within 3 years of the date the participant becomes liable to make payment under this paragraph.

        (c) If a participant fails to begin or complete the period of obligated service incurred under § 62.8, including failing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of a deferment granted by the Secretary, the participant must pay to the United States an amount determined by the formula set forth in section 754(c) of the Act. Payment of this amount shall be made within 1 year of the date that the participant failed to begin or complete the period of obligated service, as determined by the Secretary.

        § 62.11   When can a scholarship program payment obligation be discharged in bankruptcy?

#### § § 62.11

        In accordance with section 754(d)(3) of the Act, any payment obligation incurred under § 62.10 may not be discharged in bankruptcy under title XI of the United States Code until 5 years after the date on which the payment obligation is due.

        § 62.12   Under what circumstances can the service or payment obligation be canceled, waived or suspended?

#### § § 62.12

        (a) Any obligation of a participant for service or payment will be canceled upon the death of the participant.

        (b)(1) A participation may seek a waiver or suspension of the service or payment obligations incurred under this part by written request to the Secretary setting forth the bases, circumstances, and causes which support the requested action. The Secretary may approve a request for a suspension for a period of 1 year. A renewal of this suspension may also be granted.

        (2) The Secretary may waive or suspend any service or payment obligation incurred by a participant whenever compliance by the participant (i) is impossible, or (ii) would involve extreme hardship to the participant and if enforcement of the service or payment obligation would be against equity and good conscience.

        (c) Compliance by a participant with a service or payment obligation will be considered impossible if the Secretary determines, on the basis of information and documentation as may be required, that the participant suffers from a physical or mental disability resulting in the permanent inability of the participant to perform the service or other activities which would be necessary to comply with the obligation.

        (d) In determining whether to waive or suspend any or all of the service or payment obligations of a participant as imposing an undue hardship and being against equity and good conscience, the Secretary, on the basis of information and documentation as may be required, will consider:

        (1) The participant's present financial resources and obligations;

        (2) The participant's estimated future financial resources and obligations; and

        (3) The extent to which the participant has problems of a personal nature, such as physical or mental disability, terminal illness in the immediate family which so intrude on the participant's present and future ability to perform as to raise a presumption that the individual will be unable to perform the obligation incurred.

        (b) If a participant has received an award under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and also receives an award under the Scholarship Program, the following conditions apply:

        (1)  The period of obligated service owed by the participant is equal to the total number of school years for which scholarship support was awarded under both the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program without regard to either Program's minimum support requirement under 42 CFR 62.7(a) (1976) as adopted on May 22, 1974 (see 39 FR 17962), and under § 62.8(c) of this part.

        (2)  (i) If a participant received a scholarship under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program for any school year beginning before October 12, 1976, the participant will receive credit toward satisfying the periods of obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and under § 62.8 of this part for any periods of internship or residency training served in a Service or National Health Service Corps facility.

        (ii) If a participant received a scholarship for the first time during the 1977-78 school year under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program, the participant will only receive 1 year of credit toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program for internship or residency training served in a Service or National Health Service Corps facility.

        (3)  The PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program default penalty will apply to a participant who fails to begin or complete the active duty service obligation incurred under that Program, and the § 62.10 default penalties will apply to a participant who fails to begin or complete the service obligation incurred under § 62.8 of these regulations. In determining which default penalty to apply when an individual who has received a Scholarship award under both the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program fails to begin or complete his service obligation, the service obligations will be considered to have been served in the order in which they were incurred.

        § 62.71   What is the scope and purpose of the Special Repayment Program?

#### § § 62.71

        These regulations apply to the Special Repayment Program authorized under section 204 of Pub. L. 100-177, which provides a time-limited opportunity for persons who were, on November 1, 1987, in breach of a written contract under the Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program or the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program to satisfy their scholarship obligations through full-time clinical service. These regulations do not apply to any Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program or National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program obligation which the Secretary has determined was completely satisfied through service or monetary payment prior to November 1, 1987. The purpose of this program is to supply trained health professionals for the National Health Service Corps, which is used by the Secretary to improve the delivery of health services in health manpower shortage areas.

        § 62.72   Definitions.

        (1) An offer of employment from a HPOL or SHPOL site which specifies at least the agreed upon salary and start date; and

        (2) The Program participant's acceptance of that offer. Provided, however, that if the Program participant would be self-employed, a  means that the Secretary has approved a program participant's private practice option application under section 338D(a) of the Act.

        means service performed prior to a Program participant's service start date under the Special Repayment Program:

        (1) As a member of the National Health Service Corps pursuant to an assignment by the Secretary under section 333 of the Act;

        (2) Under a written private practice option agreement signed by the Secretary pursuant to section 338D of the Act; or

        means the debt that would be owed by a Program participant under section 225(f)(1) of the Act, as in effect on September 30, 1977, and/or section 338E(b) of the Act, as if no payments had been made on the debt.

        § 62.73   What are the procedures for participation in the Special Repayment Program?

#### § § 62.73

        (a)  On or before February 29, 1988, the Secretary will, subject to paragraph (h) of this section, send written notice to each eligible defaulter of the opportunity provided under this Program. The notice will be sent to the last known address of each eligible defaulter and will describe the special repayment options available under the Program.

        (b)  On or before May 29, 1988, eligible defaulters who wish to participate in this Program must sign and submit to the Secretary a written contract to provide service in accordance with either section 204(b) or section 204(c) of Pub. L. 100-177. The election between section 204(b) and section 204(c) of Pub. L. 100-177 is binding on the eligible defaulters.

        (c)  Program participants will receive a listing of approved sites appropriate to the service option they have selected. Program participants electing service under section 204(b) of Pub. L. 100-177 will receive a HPOL. Program participants electing service under section 204(c) of Pub. L. 100-177 will receive a SHPOL. The HPOL or SHPOL sent to the Program participant will be specific to the Program participant's profession and his or her specialty training which is most needed by the National Health Service Corps. The Secretary is not required to identify placements for Program participants in a medical specialty for which the National Health service Corps has no need.

        (d)  If a program participant electing to serve under section 204(b) of Pub. L. 100-177 chooses to serve at a remaining site on the 1988 HPOL, such participant must match to a site and must begin serving at the site by October 1, 1988. If a Program participant electing to serve under section 204(b) of Pub. L. 100-177 chooses to serve at a site on the 1989 HPOL, such participant must match to a HPOL site by February 15, 1989, and must begin service at the site by October 1, 1989. If a Program participant has elected to serve under section 204(c) of Pub. L. 100-177, such participant must match to a SHPOL site by May 15, 1989, and must begin service at that site by October 1, 1989.

        (e)  The Program participant is responsible for the costs of any site visit(s) and any other contact with the site to obtain employment at the site.

        (f)  If a Program participant does not match to a site or begin service at that site within the time frames described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will determine that such individual is not relieved of his or her liability to the United States under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and/or Scholarship Program (including accrued interest and/or damages).

        (g)  Service must be performed in accordance with subpart II of part D of title III of the Act. Service credit will begin after a Program participant has matched to a HPOL or SHPOL site and has commenced service at that site in accordance with subpart II of part D of title III of the Act.

        (h)  The Secretary is authorized, at any time, to deny or terminate an individual's participation in the Program for reasons related to the individual's professional competence or conduct.

        § 62.74   How much credit will a Program participant receive for monetary repayments made, or for approved service performed, before beginning service under the Special Repayment Program?

#### § § 62.74

        (a) Prior approved service performed by a Program participant will be credited to the Program participant for the purpose of calculating the Program participant's remaining service obligation under this Program. Thus, the Program participant's remaining service obligation will be calculated by subtracting the number of days of the Program participant's prior approved service from the number of days of the Program participant's original service obligation under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and/or the Scholarship Program. If a Program participant has made monetary payments, his or her remaining service obligation will be reduced by converting the monetary payments into days of service credit as set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, whichever is applicable.

        (b) Program participants who elect to serve pursuant to section 204(b) and section 204(c)(2) of Pub. L. 100-177, will not receive a refund of any amounts previously paid but will receive service credit for those payments as follows:

        (1) The number of days of service credit will be calculated by dividing the total amount paid by the Program participant prior to the Program participant's service start date by the total debt as of the service start date and multiplying the result of that division by the number of days of the participant's remaining service obligation (as determined by the formula set forth in the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this section).

        (2) If the Program participant defaults on a contract under this Program, prior monetary payments will not be credited to service but will be applied to the monetary debt owed by the Program participant.

        (c) Program participants who elect to serve under section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177 must pay an amount equal to the scholarship amount. Any amounts paid by the Program participant prior to or after entry into the Program, in accordance with § 62.76 of this subpart, will be used to reduce the Program participant's financial obligation incurred under section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177. In some cases, the amounts paid before or after entry into the Program will exceed the scholarship amount. These payments in excess of the scholarship amount will be converted into days of service credit under the formula set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a Program participant defaults on a contract under this option, the monies paid in excess of the scholarship amount will not be credited to service but will be credited toward the monetary debt owed by the Program participant under section 338E(b) of the Act or section 225(f)(1) of the Act, as in effect on September 30, 1977. The scholarship amount paid upon entering this option will be forfeited.

        § 62.75   Will individuals serving under the Special Repayment Program receive credit for partial service?

#### § § 62.75

        (a) With respect to obligations under the Scholarship Program, a credit will be allowed for partial service under the Special Repayment Program and will result in a reduction of the Program participant's financial obligation in accordance with the following formula:

        (b) With respect to obligations under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program, if a Program participant fails to complete the period of obligated service under the Program (including any additional months of service incurred pursuant to section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177), no credit for partial service under this Program will be allowed.

        (c) Where participants have obligations under both the Scholarship Program and the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program, credit for service will be applied against the scholarship obligations in the order in which they were incurred.

        § 62.76   How will amounts of money due under the option under section 204(c)(1) of Public Law 100-177 be required to be repaid?

#### § § 62.76

        Program participants who elect to serve under section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177 will be required to pay the full scholarship amount at least 60 days prior to the service start date specified in the documentation submitted to the Secretary.

      (4) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried forward to the next budget period, for use as prescribed by the Secretary, provided a continuation award is made. If at any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for that period, the Secretary may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess.

      (2) Following termination of the traineeship, the individual must annually provide (in such form and manner as the Secretary prescribes) a written report describing those previous years' activities which are related to service that fulfills the payback obligation. The Secretary will review this report and credit all service performed in those categories specified in paragraph (d) of this section toward the individual's payback obligation, except any service which is performed:

      (i) Before termination of the individual's clinical traineeship; and

      (ii) As part of any activity, such as course work, preparation of a dissertation or thesis, or practicum, which is needed to complete the training for which the individual received the traineeship.

      (c)  The period of service payback must equal the period of support under the clinical traineeship on a month for month basis.

      (d) —(1)  The obligated service must consist of the provision of service for which the individual was trained (in the training program for which the clinical traineeship was received) and must be performed on a full-time basis (not less than 30 hours per week averaged over the obligated service period).

      (2)  Except as provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the individual must provide the obligated service in:

      (i) A public inpatient mental institution;

      (ii) Any entity which is receiving or has received a grant under the Mental Health Systems Act or the Community Mental Health Centers Act;

      (iv) Any public or private nonprofit entity or in any nursing home (whether public, private nonprofit, or for profit) in which 50 percent or more of those served are within one or more of the following groups: Racial or ethnic minorities (American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic), chronically mentally ill, mentally retarded, criminal or delinquent populations, rape victims, physically handicapped, abusers of alcohol, or persons addicted to drugs or other substances, children and adolescents, the elderly, poverty populations, migrants, members of the armed forces (or veterans if seen in a Federal facility), residents of areas other than those defined as urbanized by the Department of Commerce, or any other special populations, such as groups of refugees or disaster victims, which are specifically designated by the Secretary for this purpose.

      (3)  If the individual obtains the written approval of the Secretary, the individual may fulfill his or her obligation by:

      (i) Serving in any public or private nonprofit entity or in any nursing home (whether public, private nonprofit, or for profit) in which not less than 25 percent of those served are within one or more of the underserved population groups listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The individual must demonstrate a service commitment of more than 50 percent of his or her time to the targeted populations.

      (ii) Teaching, conducting research, or conducting evaluation directed at improving alcohol, drug abuse or mental health services to one or more of the priority population groups listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, or working in a position which fosters the closer collaboration of health and alcohol, drug abuse or mental health services.

      (i) Extend the period for beginning the obligated service (24 months after termination of the clinical traineeship), permit breaks in the required continuous service or extend the period for repayment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if it is determined that:

      (A) An extension or break in service is necessary for the completion of training;

      (B) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because a temporary disability makes present performance impossible; or

      (C) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because present performance would involve a substantial hardship and failure to extend the period would be against equity and good conscience.

      (ii) Waive, in whole or in part, the service payback and recovery requirements of this section if it is determined that fulfillment would be impossible because the individual is permanently and totally disabled.

      (iii) In making determinations under § 64a.105(e)(1)(i)(C), the Secretary will take into consideration the following factors:

      (A) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;

      (B) The individual's estimated future financial resources and obligations;

      (C) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete the requirements within the prescribed period, such as problems of a personal nature;

      (D) The unavailability of employment opportunities appropriate to the individual's education and training; and

      (E) Any other extenuating circumstances.

      (2) Upon receipt of written notice giving evidence of a conflicting obligation under section 752 or 753 of the Act or of an election to fulfill an obligation under section 472 of the Act prior to an obligation under this section, the Secretary will extend the period for beginning service (24 months after termination of the clinical traineeship), permit breaks in the required continuous service or extend the period for repayment under paragraph (g)(1), as appropriate.

      (3) The service payback and recovery obligations of an individual will be cancelled upon the submission to the Secretary of a certificate of that individual's death or other evidence which the Secretary determines to be satisfactory.

      (f)  In any case where the individual has, in addition to a payback obligation incurred under this section, an obligation to perform service under section 752 or 753 of the Act (because of receipt of a National Health Service Corps scholarship) or under section 472 of the Act (because of receipt of a National Research Service Award), or both, performance of the same activity may not be counted toward more than one of these obligations. In determining the order in which obligations must be fulfilled, obligations under section 752 or 753 take precedence over obligations incurred under this section. However, with respect to obligations under this section and 472, the individual may elect which obligation to fulfill first. Any individual who has an obligation under section 752 or 753 or makes an election to fulfill an obligation under section 472 prior to an obligation under this section, must give written notice to the Secretary as provided by paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (g)  (1) If an individual fails to begin or complete the obligated service in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, that individual is obligated to repay the United States an amount equal to three times the cost of the award (including stipends and other trainee allowances) plus interest on that amount calculated for the total period since the trainee failed to perform the obligated service at the rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury for National Research Service Awards prevailing on the date on which the period of appointment begins, multiplied, in any case in which the service that was required has been performed in part, by the percentage which the length of service that was not performed is to the length of the service that was required to be performed. The amount will be determined under the following formula:

      (2) Unless the Secretary extends the repayment period as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the individual shall pay to the United States the total amount which the United States is entitled to recover under paragraph (g)(1) of this section immediately upon the date that the individual fails to begin or complete the period of obligated service (including failing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of an extension or break in service granted the individual) or upon the date that the individual indicates his or her intention not to fulfill the service obligation as determined by the Secretary. The amount is considered a debt owed to the United States, with interest accruing monthly upon the total debt as provided under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

      (1) The program of grants for the training and education of workers who are or are likely to be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal or containment, or emergency response that is authorized under section 126(g) of the SARA; and

      (2) The program of grants to support qualified non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing training and education to hazardous materials employees regarding: the safe unloading, loading, handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials; and, emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials that is authorized under section 118 of the HMTA.

      (b) Grants are available for curriculum and training materials development, technical support of training, direct student training, training program evaluation and related activities. Target populations for this training are workers and supervisors who are or are likely to be engaged in hazardous substance removal or other activities which expose or potentially expose these workers to hazardous substances in activities such as:

      (1) Waste handling and processing at waste generators and active and inactive hazardous substance treatment, storage, and disposal facilities;

      (2) Clean up, removal, containment, or remedial actions at waste sites;

      (3) Hazardous substance emergency response;

      (4) Hazardous substance disposal site risk assessment and investigation, clean up, or remedial actions; and

      Target populations may also be regulated under standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies under section 126(g) of the SARA or section 106(b) of the HMTA.

      (c) Two types of grants are available: Program grants covering the full range of activities, including program development, direct worker training and education, and program evaluation; and planning grants under the SARA.

      (1) Planning grants are intended to assist organizations which demonstrate potential for providing hazardous worker training, but need additional developmental efforts prior to initiation of full curriculum development and training activities. A limited number of one-year planning grants may be funded at a level determined appropriate by the Director. After successful completion of a one-year planning grant, a recipient may apply for a full program grant on a competitive basis.

      (2) Full program grants will be awarded to organizations with demonstrated capability to provide worker health and safety training and education and demonstrated ability to identify, describe, and access target populations. Full program grantees must be able to immediately initiate curriculum development and worker training activities.

A recommendation against further consideration shall not preclude reconsideration, if the application is revised, responding to issues and questions raised during the review, and resubmitted for peer review at a later date.

        § 67.17   Grant award.

#### § § 67.17

        (a) Within the limits of available funds, the Administrator may award grants to those applicants whose projects are being considered for funding, which in the judgment of the Administrator, will promote best the purposes of Title IX of the PHS Act and (if applicable) section 1142 of the Social Security Act, AHCPR priorities, and the regulations of this subpart.

        (b) The Notice of Grant Award specifies how long the Administrator intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 3-5 years, except for small grants, which usually are 1 year awards. The project period as specified in the Notice of Grant Award shall begin no later than 9 months following the date of the award, except that the project period must begin in the same fiscal year as that from which funds are being awarded.

        (c) Upon request from the grantee, Department grants policy permits an extension of the project period for up to 12 months, without additional funds, when more time is needed to complete the research. The Administrator may approve a request for an additional extension of time based on unusual circumstances with written justification submitted by the grantee, prior to the completion of the project period. In no case will an additional extension of more than 12 months be approved.

        (d) Generally, a grant award will be for 1 year, and subsequent continuation awards will be for 1 year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate continuation application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by the Administrator that continuation is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

        (e) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application.

        (f)  For particular categories of small grants, such as dissertation research support, the Administrator may establish a limit on total direct costs to be awarded. Any categorical limits will be announced in advance of the deadline for receipt of applications for such small grants.

        (g)  (1) Except for small grants, supplemental awards that would exceed 20 percent of the AHCPR approved direct costs of the project during the project period, or that request an increase in funds to support a change or a significant expansion of the scope of the project, will be reviewed as competing supplemental grants in accordance with § 67.15(a). A supplemental award for preparation of data in suitable form for transmittal in accordance with § 67.21 shall be excluded from the 20 percent aggregate.

        (2) In the case of small grants, as defined in section 922(d)(2) of the PHS Act, the Administrator will not approve a supplemental award during the project period (excluding any supplemental award for preparation of data in suitable form for transmittal in accordance with § 67.21) that will, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the AHCPR approved direct costs of the project.

        (h)  Each project with a project period in excess of 2 years and with direct costs over the project period in excess of the amount specified in section 922(d)(2) may be reviewed during the second budget period and during each subsequent budget period by at least two members of the peer review group that reviewed the initial application, or individuals who participated in that review, to the extent practicable. Recommendations to the Administrator for continuation support will be based upon evaluation of:

        (1) The progress of the project in meeting project objectives;

        (2) The appropriateness of the management of the project and allocation of resources within the project;

        (3) The adequacy and appropriateness of the plan for carrying out the project during the budget period in light of the accomplishments during previous budget periods; and

        (4) The reasonableness of the proposed budget for the subsequent budget period.

        § 67.18   Use of project funds.

#### § § 67.18

        Grant funds must be spent solely for carrying out the approved project in accordance with Title IX of PHS Act, section 1142 of the Social Security Act (if applicable), the regulations of this subpart, the terms and conditions of the award, and the provisions of 45 CFR part 75.

      § 68.13   What will happen if an individual does not comply with the terms and conditions of participation in the NIH LRPs?

#### § § 68.13

      Program participants who breach their Loan Repayment Program Contracts will be subject to the applicable monetary payment provisions set forth at section 338E of the Act (42 U.S.C. 254o). Payment of any amount owed under section 338E of the Act shall be made within one year of the date the participant breached his or her Loan Repayment Program Contract, unless the NIH specifically authorizes a longer period. Terminations will not be considered a breach of contract in cases where such terminations are beyond the control of the participant as follows:

      (a) Terminations for convenience of the government will not be considered a breach of contract and monetary damages will not be assessed.

      (b) Occasionally, a participant's research assignment or funding may evolve and change to the extent that the individual is no longer engaged in approved research. Similarly, the research needs and priorities of the IC and/or the NIH may change to the extent that a determination is made that a health professional's skills may be better utilized in a nonresearch assignment. Normally, job changes of this nature will not be considered a breach of contract on the part of either the NIH or the participant. Under these circumstances, the following will apply:

      (1) Program participation will cease as of the date an individual is no longer engaged in approved research;

      (2) Based on the approval of the NIH, the participant will be released from the remainder of his or her service obligation without assessment of damages or monetary penalties. The participant in this case will be permitted to retain all Program benefits made or owed by the NIH on his/her behalf up to the date the individual is no longer engaged in research, less the pro rata portion of any benefits advanced beyond the period of completed service.

#### § § 68.14

      (a) Any obligation of a participant for service or payment will be canceled upon the death of the participant.

      (b)(1) The NIH may waive or suspend any service or payment obligation incurred by the participant upon request whenever compliance by the participant:

      (i) Is impossible;

      (ii) Would involve extreme hardship to the participant; or

      (iii) If enforcement of the service or payment obligation would be unconscionable.

      (2) The NIH may approve a request for a suspension of the service or payment obligations for a period of up to one (1) year.

      (c) Compliance by a participant with a service or payment obligation will be considered impossible if the NIH determines, on the basis of information and documentation as may be required, that the participant suffers from a permanent physical or mental disability resulting in the inability of the participant to perform the service or other activities that would be necessary to comply with the obligation.

      (d) In determining whether to waive or suspend any or all of the service or payment obligations of a participant as imposing an undue hardship and being against good conscience, the NIH, on the basis of such information and documentation as may be required, will consider:

      (1) The participant's present financial resources and obligations;

      (2) The participant's estimated future financial resources and obligations; and

      (3) The extent to which the participant has problems of a personal nature, such as a physical or mental disability or terminal illness in the immediate family, which so intrude on the participant's present and future ability to perform as to raise a presumption that the individual will be unable to perform the obligation incurred.

      § 68.15   When can an NIH LRP payment obligation be discharged in bankruptcy?

#### § § 68.15

      Any payment obligation incurred under § 68.13 of this part may be discharged in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code only if such discharge is granted after the expiration of the seven-year period beginning on the first date that payment is required and only if the bankruptcy court finds that a non-discharge of the obligation would be unconscionable.

      § 68.16   Additional conditions.

#### § § 68.16

      (a) When a shortage of funds exists, participants may be funded only partially, as determined by the NIH. However, once an NIH LRP contract has been signed by both parties, the NIH will obligate such funds as necessary to ensure that sufficient funds will be available to pay benefits for the duration of the period of obligated service unless, by mutual written agreement, the parties specify otherwise.

      (b) Additional conditions may be imposed as deemed necessary.

      § 68.17   What other regulations and statutes apply?

#### § § 68.17

      Several other regulations and statutes apply to this part. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:

        (4) The means by which the prohibition shall be implemented; and

In addition, the Director may, as practicable under the circumstances, consult with any State or local authorities that he or she deems appropriate in his or her discretion.

        (1) If the order will be implemented in whole or in part by State and local authorities who have agreed to do so under 42 U.S.C. 243(a), then the Director shall explain in the order the procedures and standards by which those authorities are expected to aid in the enforcement of the order.

The licensed veterinarian must return conditionally released animals immediately to the custody of the carrier or the CDC-registered animal care facility upon the conclusion of such medical care or evaluation.

        when applied to an animal, means restriction to a building or other enclosure at a U.S. port or other location approved by the Director, including  to a destination, separate from other animals, and from persons except for contact necessary for its care. If the animal is allowed out of the enclosure, it must be muzzled and kept on a leash.

        means dog-maintained rabies virus variant and includes any rabies virus variant that is known or suspected to have an enzootic transmission cycle in which dogs are essential for the maintenance of the viral variant. This includes epidemiologic situations in which dogs are the only recognized reservoir species, as well as situations in which dogs and other species (typically wildlife) both play epidemiologically relevant roles in maintaining enzootic transmission.

        means a country determined by the Director as not having DMRVV present based on internationally accepted standards.

        means a country determined by the Director as having high risk for DMRVV transmission based on factors such as the presence and geographic distribution of the virus, or low quality of or low confidence in rabies surveillance systems or dog vaccination programs. A list of the DMRVV high-risk countries is available on CDC's website.

        means a country determined by the Director as having low risk for DMRVV transmission based on factors such as the virus being limited to a localized area, adequacy of surveillance and dog vaccination programs to prevent further geographic distribution of the virus, and the virus being in a controlled status with the country's heading toward eventual DMRVV-free status.

        means a country from which the import of dogs into the United States has been prohibited or otherwise restricted. Designation of a _DMRVV-restricted country_ may be based on the country's export of dogs infected with DMRVV to any other country within a timeframe determined by the Director or based on the country's lacking adequate controls, as determined by the Director, to monitor and prevent the export of dogs to the United States with falsified or fraudulent rabies vaccination credentials, inaccurate or invalid rabies vaccination documentation, or other fraudulent, inaccurate, or invalid importation documents.

        means any person transporting one or more animals on behalf of an importer for purposes of resale, adoption, or transfer of ownership.

        (ii) The dog has a valid and complete certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form and a valid serologic titer from a CDC-approved laboratory.

        (e)  (1) The Director may limit the times, U.S. ports, or conditions under which dogs or cats may arrive at and be admitted to the United States based on an importer's, CDC-registered animal care facility's, or carrier's failure to comply with the provisions of this section or as needed to protect the public's health. If the Director determines a limitation is required, the Director will notify importers, CDC-registered animal care facilities, and carriers in writing of the specific times, U.S. ports, or conditions under which dogs and cats may be permitted to arrive at and be admitted to the United States.

        (2) CBP will prescribe the time, place, and manner in which dogs are presented upon arrival at a port of entry, which may include prohibiting dogs from being presented within the Federal Inspection Station.

        (f)  (1) All dogs presented for admission into the United States must be at least six (6) months old at the time of their arrival into the United States.

        (2) Dogs arriving into the United States that are not at least six (6) months old at the time of their arrival shall be denied admission and returned to the country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section.

        (g)  (1) All dogs presented for admission into the United States must have a microchip implanted prior to arrival at the U.S. port.

        (2) The microchip must have been implanted on or before the date the current rabies vaccine was administered. Rabies vaccines administered prior to the implantation of a microchip are invalid.

        (3) The microchip number must be documented on the certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form, the certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form, or if the dog is arriving from a DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free country, documented on one of the forms listed in paragraph (u)(2) of this section and all accompanying veterinary records. The microchip number must also be documented on the CDC dog import form.

        (4) Importers must consent to the scanning of the dogs' microchip by CDC quarantine public health officers, CDC-registered animal care facility staff, or their representatives, upon the dogs' arrival at a U.S. port.

        (5) Dogs arriving in the United States without a microchip, with a microchip that cannot be detected, with a microchip that does not match the accompanying documentation, or if the importer refuses to have the dogs' microchip scanned, shall be denied admission and returned to the country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section.

        (h)  (1) All importers of dogs must submit a complete and accurate CDC dog import form to CDC via a CDC-approved system prior to the dogs arriving in the United States. This includes accompanied or unaccompanied dogs arriving by air, land, or sea regardless of where the dogs originated or whether arriving as cargo, checked-baggage, or hand-carried baggage. This excludes dogs that are transiting through the United States without making an entry in accordance with paragraph (cc) of this section.

        (2) Dogs that arrive without a receipt confirming that the CDC dog import form was submitted before the dogs' arrival in the United States may be denied admission and returned to their country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section, regardless of the value of the shipment.

        (3) Dogs arriving by air without a receipt confirming that the CDC dog import form was submitted before the dogs' arrival in the United States may be held in the care of a CDC-registered animal care facility, on a space-available basis, for up to 24 hours after their arrival. If the dogs arrive at an airport without a CDC-registered animal care facility or if the animal care facility lacks space to house the dogs, the dogs may be held in the care of a licensed veterinarian approved by CDC for up to 24 hours after their arrival until the  is filed. The importer (or airline if the importer abandons the animal) is responsible for making all necessary arrangements with a CDC-registered animal care facility or a veterinary clinic (if the CDC-registered animal care facility is unavailable at the airport or lacks space to house the dogs), including arranging transportation to the facility. The airline may require reimbursement from an importer for any associated costs incurred by the airline on the importer's behalf.

        (4) Dogs arriving by sea without a receipt confirming submission of a CDC dog import form may be held on board the vessel until the form is filed. The vessel's owner or operator may require reimbursement from an importer for any associated costs incurred by the vessel's owner or operator on the importer's behalf.

        (5) Dogs arriving by land without a receipt confirming submission of a CDC dog import form shall be denied admission and returned immediately to the dogs' country of departure, but such denial does not prevent the importer from reapplying for admission of the dogs after the form is filed.

        (6) A receipt confirming submission of the CDC dog import form must accompany all dogs departing foreign locations for travel to the United States. For dogs departing from foreign airports to the United States, the airline must deny boarding to dogs unless the importer has presented this receipt prior to boarding.

        (7) Airlines, unless granted a waiver in accordance with paragraph (dd) of this section, are required to create a bill of lading for all dogs arriving in the United States prior to the dogs' arrival. This includes dogs transported as cargo, checked-baggage, or hand-carried baggage. If granted a waiver to the bill of lading requirement, the airline's handling and transport of the dogs must be consistent with the terms of that waiver.

        (8) Unless being transported by an airline for which a waiver to the bill of lading requirement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (dd) of this section, dogs arriving by air for which a bill of lading has not been filed prior to their arrival in the United States (or if the airline's handling and transport of the dogs is inconsistent with the terms of the waiver) shall be denied admission and returned to their country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section.

        (i)  (1) All animals arriving at a U.S. port shall be inspected upon arrival, and only those animals that show no signs of communicable disease as defined in 42 CFR 71.1 shall be admitted into the United States.

        (2) All animals presented for admission into the United States may be subject to additional examination and disease surveillance screening for the purpose of communicable disease surveillance. Ill animals may be required to undergo additional diagnostic testing prior to release of the animal; such testing is not considered surveillance screening.

        (3) The Director may require confinement of an animal and examination by a veterinarian when necessary to determine whether the animal is admissible into the United States, for instance, if dental examination would assist in determining the animal's age.

        (4) Importers who refuse to consent to inspection, examination, disease surveillance screening, or diagnostic testing of the animal upon arrival shall have the animal denied admission and returned to its country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section.

        (j)  (1) If an animal, upon inspection, does not appear to be in good health ( it has signs such as emaciation, lesions of the skin, discharge of the eyes or nose, coughing, sneezing, nervous system disturbances, inability to stand or walk, difficulty breathing, jaundice, vomiting, or diarrhea), or appears healthy but, during shipment, may have been exposed to a sick or dead animal (including an animal other than a dog or cat) suspected of having a communicable disease, the Director may require prompt confinement and veterinary examination.

        (2) In the case of animals that appear unhealthy or those that were potentially exposed and arriving by air or sea, the Director may require the airline or vessel's master or operator to arrange for a licensed veterinarian to examine the animal and give or arrange for any tests or treatment indicated. In the case of animals that appear unhealthy or those that were potentially exposed and arriving by land, the Director may deny admission, but such denial does not prevent the importer from reapplying for admission after providing the Director with satisfactory evidence that a licensed veterinarian has examined the animal and administered any tests or treatment as needed to ensure the animal does not have a communicable disease.

        (3) Carriers shall maintain a record of sickness of animals occurring while  to the United States and shall submit the record to the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the U.S. port.

        (4) Animals that become sick while  or on arrival shall be separated from other animals (including animals other than dogs or cats) as soon as the sickness is discovered and shall be held in confinement pending any necessary examination as determined by the Director.

        (5) Airlines (in the case of arrivals by air) or the masters or operators of vessels (in the case of arrivals by sea) shall immediately arrange for confinement and medical evaluation of any ill or injured animals at a CDC-registered animal care facility or CDC-approved veterinary facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) which, in the judgment of the Director, affords protection against transmission of any communicable disease, and suitable housing in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131  as may be amended). In the case of ill or injured animals arriving by land, the Director may deny admission, but such denial does not prevent the importer from reapplying for admission after providing the Director with satisfactory evidence of confinement (as needed) and examination by a licensed veterinarian.

        (6) The airline or vessel's master or operator shall immediately thereafter arrange for transportation of any ill or injured animals by a CBP-bonded transporter to the CDC-registered animal care facility or other CDC-approved veterinary facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) for confinement and medical evaluation. The airline or vessel's master or operator shall arrange to have ill or injured animals transported in a way that does not expose transportation personnel or the public to communicable diseases.

        (7) The Director will consider the findings of the examination and tests in determining whether the animal may have a communicable disease.

        (8) The importer shall bear the expenses of transportation, confinement, examination, tests, and treatment under this paragraph. If an importer fails to arrange for or pay for such expenses or cooperate with any CDC-mandated public health evaluations, then the animal will be considered abandoned, and the carrier shall assume financial responsibility pursuant to paragraph (aa) of this section.

        (9) Confinement shall be subject to conditions specified by the Director to protect the public's health.

        (10) CDC may request that CBP conditionally release animals for medical evaluation and treatment in emergency or exigent circumstances. Animals eligible for conditional release shall remain under the legal custody of the carrier or CDC-registered animal care facility for the purpose of receiving veterinary medical care. If such animals are conditionally released to a CDC-approved veterinary facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available or cannot provide the level of care needed), then the animal must be immediately returned to the custody of the carrier or CDC-registered animal care facility once medical treatment is no longer required or upon request by either CDC or CBP.

        (11) If an importer (or carrier if the animal is abandoned by the importer) opts to have an animal euthanatized ( under circumstances where the animal is fatally ill or injured), the importer or carrier shall promptly communicate this decision to CDC in writing and prior to euthanasia. Euthanasia does not relieve importers or carriers of the obligation to arrange and pay for testing and necropsy required by CDC.

        (k)  (1) All dogs arriving into the United States that have been in DMRVV high-risk countries within the last six months and that do not have a valid certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form shall undergo veterinary examination and revaccination against rabies at a CDC-registered animal care facility upon arrival.

        (2) The importer is responsible for making all arrangements relating to the examination, revaccination, and quarantine (if applicable) at a CDC-registered animal care facility prior to the dog's arrival in the United States. The costs of examination, vaccination, and quarantine (if applicable) shall be borne by the importer and not at the government's expense.

        (3) Prior to granting a reservation, CDC-registered animal care facilities must ensure they have received the following:

        (i) The completed certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form;

        (ii) Serologic test results (if applicable) obtained from a CDC-approved laboratory on a blood sample drawn, submitted, and tested in accordance with CDC's technical instructions;

        (iii) Photos of the dogs' teeth to assist with age verification;

        (iv) The travel itinerary for the dogs confirming that the dogs will be arriving only at a U.S. airport with a CDC-registered animal care facility and will not be arriving at any other U.S. port; and

        (v) A receipt confirming submission of the CDC dog import form.

        (4) Importers must present documentation to airlines confirming their reservation at a CDC-registered animal care facility prior to their dogs boarding a flight to the United States. Airlines must deny boarding to dogs if the importer fails to present such documentation.

        (5) Airlines must deny boarding to any foreign-vaccinated dog that has been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months for which the importer has not presented a receipt confirming submission of the CDC dog import form and proof of a reservation at a CDC-registered animal care facility, or that is being presented for travel to an unauthorized U.S. airport.

        (6) The airline shall arrange for dogs to be transported by a CBP-bonded transporter to the CDC-registered animal care facility immediately upon arrival at the U.S. airport.

        (7) The dogs shall remain in the custody of the CDC-registered animal care facility until the following requirements are met:

        (i) Veterinary health examination by a USDA-accredited veterinarian for signs of illness. All illnesses must be documented in SAFE TraQ. CDC will review these illness case reports and determine admissibility prior to the dog's release. Suspected or confirmed communicable diseases, including the presence of ectoparasites ( ticks and fleas), must be reported to CDC prior to release of the dog;

        (ii) Confirmation of microchip number;

        (iii) Confirmation of age through dental examination by a USDA-accredited veterinarian;

        (iv) Vaccination against rabies with a USDA-licensed rabies vaccine that is administered by a USDA-accredited veterinarian; and

        (v) Confirmation of adequate rabies serologic titer from a CDC-approved laboratory. Blood samples for serologic tests must be drawn within a timeframe as specified in CDC technical instructions. Dogs that arrive without an adequate rabies serologic test results from a CDC-approved laboratory, or with a serologic test result drawn outside the acceptable timeframe, or with serologic test results outside acceptable parameters, shall be housed at the CDC-registered animal care facility for a 28-day quarantine period following administration of the USDA-licensed rabies vaccine.

        (l)  (1) A facility must register with and receive written approval from the Director to function as a CDC-registered animal care facility before housing any live dog imported into the United States. Applications and all required documents must be submitted to

        (3) Upon receiving the documentation required by this section, the Director will review the application and either grant or deny the application for registration as a CDC-registered animal care facility. Applications that are denied may be appealed under paragraph (r) of this section.

        (i) Before issuing a registration, the Director may inspect any animal health record, facility, vehicle, or equipment to be used in management, examination, and clearance of imported animals. Thereafter, animal health records, facilities, vehicles, and equipment used in importing animals may be inspected during annual site inspection visits or when otherwise needed to protect the public's health.

        (ii) CDC may conduct unannounced inspections of facilities seeking to register or renew their status as a CDC-registered animal care facility or when otherwise needed to protect the public's health.

        (iii) CDC inspections will be based on USDA Animal Welfare regulation standards (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) and other standards as outlined in CDC's

        (iv) Unless revoked in accordance with paragraph (r) of this section, a registration certificate issued under this section is effective for two years beginning from the date CDC issues the registration certificate.

        (v) Suspected or confirmed communicable diseases, including the presence of ectoparasites ( ticks and fleas), must be reported to CDC within 24 hours of identification.

        (3) Upon completion of the quarantine period and before a facility releases any animal from quarantine, the facility must ensure that the facility's USDA-accredited veterinarian has verified the health status of the animal.

        (4) Any report required under this paragraph must be uploaded to SAFE TraQ prior to the release of the animal.

        (q)  (1) A CDC-registered animal care facility must maintain a quarantine area for holding animals when quarantine is required. Foreign-vaccinated dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country within six months of arrival must be quarantined for 28 days after revaccination with a USDA-licensed rabies vaccine at the facility if they do not have a valid rabies serologic test from a CDC-approved laboratory. CDC may also require quarantine or extend the quarantine period if a facility or CDC finds or suspects that an animal is infected with, or has been exposed to, a communicable disease or if CDC determines that additional diagnostic testing is warranted.

        (2) For any quarantine area established or maintained under this section, a facility must establish, implement, maintain, and adhere to standard operating procedures that meet the following physical security requirements:

        (i) The CDC-registered animal care facility must be locked and secure, with access limited to authorized and trained personnel.

        (ii) A CDC-registered animal care facility must limit access to animal quarantine areas to authorized personnel responsible for the transport, care, or treatment of the animals.

        (3) During the quarantine period, a CDC-registered animal care facility must monitor animals for signs of any communicable disease, including, but not limited to, signs consistent with rabies, brucellosis, leptospirosis, leishmaniasis, or ecto- or endoparasites.

        (4) If any animals appear ill during quarantine, the CDC-registered animal care facility must, in accordance with paragraphs (p)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, ensure appropriate evaluation, monitoring, and treatment. Suspected or confirmed communicable diseases in animals must be reported to CDC within 24 hours.

        (5) A CDC-registered animal care facility must not knowingly release any ill animal from quarantine under paragraph (q)(3) of this section without prior consultation with and written approval from CDC.

        (6) Quarantined animals must be housed in such a manner that they do not expose other quarantined animals or non-quarantined animals (including animals other than dogs or cats) to potentially infectious materials, including soiled bedding, caging, and other potentially contaminated items. Animals in quarantine may not be housed together.

        (7) If CDC notifies a CDC-registered animal care facility of any evidence that animals have been exposed to a communicable disease, the facility must, at the facility's expense (subject to reimbursement by the importer or carrier (in case of abandonment)), implement or cooperate in the CDC's implementation of additional measures to rule out the spread of suspected communicable disease before releasing an animal or shipment of animals from quarantine, including examination, additional diagnostic procedures, treatment, detention, extended quarantine, isolation, seizure, or destruction of exposed animals.

        (8) A CDC-registered animal care facility must establish, implement, and adhere to standard operating procedures for safe handling and necropsy of any animal that dies in quarantine.

        (r)  (1) The Director may revoke a CDC-registered animal care facility's registration if the Director determines that the facility has failed to comply with any applicable provisions of this section, the facility's standard operating procedures, USDA Animal Welfare standards (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3), or other standards as outlined in CDC's

        (2) CDC will send the CDC-registered animal care facility a notice of revocation stating the grounds upon which the proposed revocation is based.

        (3) If the CDC-registered animal care facility wishes to contest the revocation, the facility must file a written response to the notice within five business days after receiving the notice.

        (4) As part of the response, a CDC-registered animal care facility may request that the Director review the written record.

        (5) If a CDC-registered animal care facility fails to file a response within five business days, all of the grounds listed in the proposed revocation will be deemed admitted, in which case the notice shall constitute final agency action, unless the Secretary, within one business day, decides to excuse the facility's failure to respond on a timely basis.

        (6) If a CDC-registered animal care facility's response is timely, the Director will review the registration, the notice of revocation, the response, and make a decision in writing based on the written record.

        (7) As soon as practicable after completing the written record review, the Director will issue a decision in writing that shall constitute final agency action, unless the Secretary, within one business day, decides to review the Director's decision. The Director will provide the facility with a copy of the written decision.

        (8) The Director may reinstate a revoked registration after inspecting the facility, examining its records, conferring with the facility, and receiving information and assurance from the facility of compliance with the requirements of this section.

        (s)  (1) Importers of foreign-vaccinated dogs from DMRVV high-risk countries must submit the certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form to the CDC-registered animal care facility in order to make a reservation at that facility.

        (2) Importers must present documentation confirming the dog's reservation at a CDC-registered animal care facility to the airline prior to boarding and to CBP upon arrival at a U.S. port for admission of foreign-vaccinated dogs from DMRVV high-risk countries.

        (3) The certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form must be truthful and accurate, completed in English, and include:

        (i) The name of the person importing the dog (consignee), physical address, phone number, email address, passport number, and date of birth;

        (ii) The owner's name, phone number, and email address;

        (iii) The destination address (physical address) where the dog will reside upon arrival in the United States;

        (iv) The dog's name, breed, sex, date of birth or approximate age if the date of birth is unknown, and color or markings of the dog;

        (v) Rabies vaccination information for the dog administered within a timeframe and in accordance with the vaccination schedule as specified in CDC technical instructions;

        (vi) Rabies vaccine product information (product name, manufacturer, lot number, and product expiration date);

        (vii) Rabies vaccine expiration date (date when next vaccine is due), which must be after the dog's date of arrival at a U.S. port;

        (viii) Microchip number and microchip implant date, which must be on or before the date of administration of the most recent rabies vaccination included on this form;

        (ix) The name, license number or official stamp, address, telephone number, email address, and signature of the authorized veterinarian or official government veterinarian that examined the dog in the exporting country; and

        (x) The name, address, official seal or stamp, and signature of an official government veterinarian attesting that the authorized veterinarian is licensed or authorized to practice veterinary medicine in the exporting country and further attesting that the information listed on the form is true and correct.

        (4) Importers who fail or refuse to present the certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form or present a form that is untruthful, inaccurate, and incomplete may result in the dog being denied admission and returned to the country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section.

        (t)  (1) Importers returning to the United States with a U.S.-vaccinated dog that has been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months may present their dog for admission without a rabies serologic test from a CDC-approved laboratory, without the dog undergoing veterinary examination (unless ill, injured, or exposed), and without revaccination against rabies or quarantine at a CDC-registered animal care facility upon arrival under the following circumstances:

        (i) The importer presents a certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form that is truthful, complete, and accurate.

        (ii) The importer presents a valid certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form that sufficiently and reliably demonstrates that a USDA-licensed rabies vaccine was administered within a timeframe and age parameters as specified in CDC technical instructions.

        (2) The certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form must have been completed and endorsed prior to the dog leaving the United States and cannot be completed upon arrival at a U.S. port or after the dog has left the United States.

        (3) Importers returning to the United States from a DMRVV high-risk country with their U.S.-vaccinated dog that are unable to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall have the dog treated as if it was vaccinated in a foreign country in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (k) and (s) of this section or, alternatively, have the dog denied admission and returned to the country of departure pursuant to the paragraph (v) of this section.

        (4) If an importer fails to immediately (within 24 hours of arrival) arrange for the dog's return to the country of departure, then the animal will be considered abandoned pursuant to paragraph (aa) of this section.

        (u)  (1) Dogs arriving, including those returning to the United States, from a DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free country may be admitted into the United States subject to the requirements in this section if the importer submits written documentation satisfactory to the Director that for the six months before arrival, the dog has been only in DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free countries.

        (2) For purposes of paragraph (u)(1) of this section, written documentation satisfactory to the Director shall include any one of the following:

        (i) A valid certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form if completed in a DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country and the dogs are arriving into the United States from the same DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country as that listed on the form. This form must be completed by an authorized veterinarian, which may include an official government veterinarian, and must be certified by an official government veterinarian in the exporting country;

        (ii) A valid certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form completed by a USDA-accredited veterinarian and endorsed by a USDA official veterinarian;

        (iii) A valid USDA export certificate if the certificate is issued to allow the dogs to travel to a DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country and the dogs are returning to the United States from the same DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country as that listed on the export certificate. The form must be completed by a USDA-accredited veterinarian and endorsed by a USDA official veterinarian;

        (iv) A valid foreign export certificate from a DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country that has been certified by an official government veterinarian in that country. The export certificate must be accompanied by veterinary records (such as the European Union pet passport) or proof of payment for veterinary services establishing that veterinary services were performed in the exporting country at least six months before traveling to the United States;

        (v) A certification of dog arriving from DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country form if accompanied by veterinary records or proof of payment for veterinary services establishing that veterinary services were performed in the same DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country at least six months before travel to the United States. This form must be completed by an authorized veterinarian, which may include an official government veterinarian, and must be certified by an official government veterinarian in the exporting country; or

        (vi) Other records or documents satisfactory to the Director that CDC may establish through technical instructions and publish on its website.

        (v)  (1) The following categories of animals are inadmissible to the United States:

        (i) Any dog arriving from a DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free country without written documentation satisfactory to the Director that the dog has been only in DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free countries during the six months prior to the attempted entry, or if the Director reasonably suspects fraud.

        (ii) Any dog that is not accompanied by a receipt confirming that a CDC dog import form has been submitted to CDC through a CDC-approved system.

        (iii) Any dog arriving by air for which a bill of lading, including an air waybill, has not been created by the airline prior to the dog's arrival in the United States (regardless of the value of the shipment) unless the airline transporting the dog has been granted a waiver pursuant to paragraph (dd) of this section and the airline's handling and transport of the dog is consistent with the terms of that waiver.

        (iv) Any unvaccinated or foreign-vaccinated dog arriving by land to the United States if the dog has been in a DMRVV high-risk countries within the last six months.

        (v) Any unvaccinated or foreign-vaccinated dog arriving by sea to the United States if the dog has been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months, except for a foreign-vaccinated dog qualifying as a service animal and meeting the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

        (vi) Any animal imported by an importer who refuses to comply with the requirements (if applicable) for disease surveillance screening, microchip scanning, veterinary examination, diagnostics tests to rule out communicable diseases, revaccination, providing proof of sufficient rabies serologic tests, or quarantine (if applicable) at a CDC-registered animal care facility or other CDC-approved facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) upon arrival.

        (vii) Any dog that has been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months and arrives without a valid certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form or a valid certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form.

        (viii) Any foreign-vaccinated dog that has been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months and does not arrive via air at a U.S. airport with a CDC quarantine station and a CDC-registered animal care facility, except for a foreign-vaccinated dog arriving by sea that qualifies as a service animal and meets the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

        (ix) Any dog imported from a DMRVV high-risk country that arrives without a reservation at a CDC-registered animal care facility (if applicable).

        (x) Any dog from a DMRVV-restricted country that arrives without a valid CDC dog import permit.

        (xi) Any dog, regardless of country of departure, if the Director reasonably suspects fraud in any documentation required for admission or if such documentation is otherwise untruthful, inaccurate, or incomplete.

        (xii) Any animal, regardless of country of departure, that poses a public health risk, including animals that appear unhealthy upon arrival or demonstrate signs or symptoms of communicable disease.

        (xiii) Any dog under six months of age that arrives in the United States.

        (xiv) Any dog that arrives in the United States without a microchip or without its microchip number documented on the importation paperwork required by CDC.

        (2) An importer must meet the admission requirements of all U.S. government agencies for the admission of an animal into the United States. Satisfaction of CDC's requirements for the admission of animals does not fulfill the admission requirements of other U.S. government agencies.

        (w)  (1) Animals arriving by air that are denied admission and awaiting return to their country of departure or awaiting a determination as to their admissibility must be held in a CDC-registered animal care facility or other CDC-approved facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) in such a way as to prevent the potential spread of communicable diseases.

        (2) An airline must arrange to transport an animal arriving by air to a CDC-registered animal care facility (or other boarding, kennel, or veterinary clinic approved by CDC if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) if the animal is denied admission and is awaiting return to its country of departure or is awaiting a determination of its admissibility. If the animal is apparently healthy, the airline must transport the animal (by a CBP-bonded transporter) within 12 hours of its arrival.

        (3) An airline must immediately report an obviously ill or injured animal ( the animal is unable to stand, has difficulty breathing, is bleeding, has broken bones or disfigured limbs, or is experiencing seizures, vomiting, or discharge from the nose, mouth, or eyes) arriving into the United States to the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction. The airline must immediately arrange to transport an obviously ill or injured animal by a CBP-bonded transporter to a CDC-registered animal care facility or veterinary clinic as directed by CDC.

        (4) Animals arriving by sea that are denied admission must remain on the vessel while awaiting return to the country of departure.

        (x)  (1) Animals shall be subject to such additional requirements as authorized under this part or 42 CFR part 70 as may be deemed necessary by the Director to protect the public's health, including suspension of entry under § 71.63.

        (2) Animals denied admission to the United States that were transported to the United States via air must be returned by the airline to the country of departure at the importer's expense on the next available outbound flight (no later than 72 hours after arrival), regardless of airline or route, if fit to travel. Pending the animal's return, the animal shall be detained at the importer's expense in the custody of the carrier at a CDC-registered animal care facility (or other boarding, kennel, or veterinary clinic approved by CDC if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available).

        (3) Animals denied admission to the United States that were transported to the United States via sea shall be reembarked immediately by the vessel's master or operator and returned to their country of departure on the next voyage.

        (4) Animals denied admission to the United States that were transported to the United States via land shall be returned immediately by importer or carrier to their country of departure.

        (5) If an animal is not fit to travel, poses a public health risk, or would pose a risk to other animals, then the carrier shall arrange for the animal to be transported to a CDC-registered animal care facility or a CDC-approved veterinary clinic (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) for housing and treatment by a licensed veterinarian until approved for travel by CDC or humanely euthanized ( under circumstances where the animal is fatally ill or injured) by a licensed veterinarian. The importer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the denial, veterinary evaluation, care, or disposal of the animal. If the importer refuses to pay for any costs associated with the denial, evaluation, care, or disposal of the animal, then it will be considered abandoned, and the carrier shall assume custody and financial responsibility for these costs.

        (6) If humane euthanasia is recommended by a veterinarian or chosen by an importer or carrier ( under circumstances where the animal is fatally ill or injured), the animal must be euthanized by a U.S.-licensed veterinarian in accordance with American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines. Euthanasia does not relieve carriers or importers of the obligation to arrange and pay for testing and necropsy required by CDC.

        (7) The Director may grant temporary extensions of returns for animals that are not fit for travel as determined by a CDC veterinarian, but the importer (or carrier in the case of abandonment) must arrange for the return of the animal to its country of departure as soon as CDC notifies the carrier that the animal is fit for travel.

        (8) The requirements of this paragraph shall additionally apply to dogs or cats abandoned by the importer prior to the dogs' or cats' admission into the United States. A dog or cat may be deemed abandoned pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (aa) of this section.

        (9) Carriers must provide transportation to/from and holding at a CDC-registered animal care facility or another CDC-approved facility (if a CDC-registered animal care facility is not available) while the animal is pending an admissibility determination, undergoing veterinary evaluation or care, or upon denial of entry. Carriers may require reimbursement from an importer for any costs incurred on behalf of the importer.

        (10) Importers must comply with CDC requirements for the return of an animal or for the veterinary assessment of an animal. Refusal to cooperate, including refusal to pay any associated veterinary fees, will result in the animal being considered abandoned by the importer, and custody of the animal will be transferred to the carrier who will assume financial responsibility for costs relating to the denial, evaluation, care, or disposal of the animal.

        (11) A carrier may enter into contractual arrangements with an importer or a third party relating to the expenses of returning an animal to its country of departure, for veterinary care, or otherwise disposing of an animal, provided that no government costs are incurred. The return of an animal to its country of departure or the initiation of veterinary care shall not be delayed while the carrier attempts to enter into or negotiate contractual arrangements.

        (12) The provisions of this paragraph may be applied to importers of animals and to carriers transporting such animals in circumstances where an animal is denied entry at a land port or seaport of the United States and the animal cannot be immediately returned to its country of departure ( because it is unfit to travel).

        (y)  (1) If CDC denies admission to an animal upon arrival, then the importer may appeal that denial to the Director.

        (2) The importer must submit the appeal in writing to the Director, stating the reasons for the appeal and demonstrating that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute.

        (3) The importer must submit the appeal within one (1) business day of the denial by emailing

        (4) Submitting an appeal will not delay the return of the animal to the country of departure.

        (5) The Director will issue a written response to the appeal, which shall constitute final agency action, unless the Secretary, within one (1) business day, decides to review the Director's decision.

        (z)  (1) Carriers shall maintain a record of the death of animals occurring while  to the United States and shall submit the record to the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction for the U.S. port upon arrival.

        (2) Animals that become sick or die  or are identified as sick or dead upon arrival shall be separated from other animals (including animals other than dogs or cats) as soon as the sickness or death is discovered and shall be held in confinement pending any necessary examination as determined by the Director. Sick animals shall be examined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section or disposed of pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (x) of this section.

        (3) The carrier shall arrange for any animals that die  to the United States or that die while detained pending determination of their admissibility to undergo a necropsy (gross and histopathologic examination are required), and any subsequent infectious disease testing based on gross or histopathology findings or as determined by CDC. The carrier or CDC-registered animal care facility must contact the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction prior to transporting an animal for necropsy to determine whether rabies testing is required. In the event an importer abandons an animal, the carrier will become the owner and shall assume responsibility for all expenses described in this paragraph.

        (4) The carrier shall send copies of the final necropsy report and all test results to the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction.

        (5) Pursuant to paragraphs (p) and (x) of this section, the importer is responsible for costs associated with the necropsy, testing, and disposal of the body. In the event an importer abandons an animal, then pursuant to paragraph (aa) of this section, the carrier will become the owner and shall assume responsibility for all expenses described in this paragraph.

        (aa)  (1) In the event an importer abandons an animal under this section, the carrier will become the owner and shall assume responsibility for all expenses described in this section.

        (2) An animal shipment will be deemed abandoned under the following circumstances:

        (i) when explicitly stated by the importer verbally or in writing to the carrier, CDC, or CBP; or

        (ii) if the importer fails to cooperate with or respond to the carrier's attempts to comply with the provisions of this section within 24 hours; or

        (iii) if the importer refuses payment within 24 hours for CDC-mandated examinations, testing, holding, or treatment needed to ensure the safe importation of dogs and cats into the United States.

        (bb)  When the Director finds that the cages or other containers of animals arriving in the United States are in an unsanitary or other condition that may constitute a communicable disease risk, the animals shall not be admitted in such containers unless the carrier has the containers cleaned and disinfected or the animals are removed and placed in clean containers in accordance with USDA and, in the case of airlines, the International Air Transport Association shipping requirements. Discarded containers must be cleaned and disinfected or destroyed in accordance with carrier policies. CDC may require documentation of container disinfection or destruction by the carrier.

        (cc)  (1) In-transit shipments of live animals are not eligible for release into the United States and may only be transported as cargo and not as hand-carried baggage or checked/excess baggage.

        (2) In-transit shipments must be maintained under continuous confinement with USDA APHIS oversight on board a conveyance until export, or off-loaded and maintained under continuous confinement and APHIS oversight at a USDA APHIS-preapproved holding facility with a CBP-issued FIRMS code while awaiting a connecting conveyance, and then loaded and maintained under USDA APHIS oversight on board the connecting conveyance until export.

        (3) The provisions of this section shall apply to animals transiting through the United States from one foreign country to another, except as provided below:

        (i) Animals that appear healthy but have been exposed to a sick or dead animal (including an animal other than a dog or cat) suspected of having a communicable disease are not required to undergo examination or tests as provided in paragraph (j) of this section if the Director determines that the conditions under which the animals are being transported afford adequate protection against introduction of communicable disease into the United States.

        (ii) The certification of foreign rabies vaccination and microchip form, certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form, certification of dog arriving from DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk country form, or CDC dog import form is not required for dogs that are transported by aircraft and are being transited through the United States if retained in the custody of the airline under conditions that would prevent transmission of communicable diseases.

        (iii) There is no minimum age requirement for dogs that are transported by aircraft and are being transited through the United States if retained in the custody of the airline under conditions that would prevent transmission of communicable diseases.

        (iv) A microchip is not required for dogs that are transported by aircraft and are being transited through the United States if retained in the custody of the airline under conditions that would prevent transmission of communicable diseases.

        (dd)  (1) Airlines are required to create a bill of lading, which includes air waybills (AWB), for all dogs arriving in the United States prior to arrival. This includes dogs transported as cargo, checked-baggage, or hand-carried baggage.

        (2) Airlines that lack the technical ability to generate a bill of lading to transport dogs as checked baggage or as hand-carried baggage may request a waiver from CDC by emailing

        (i) The airline's request for a waiver must be accompanied by a written standard operating procedure (SOP) describing how the airline will ensure care, transportation, and housing for any ill, injured, or abandoned animals in the absence of a bill of lading. The SOP must also identify and provide the location of a CDC-registered animal care facility or other suitable alternative approved by CBP and CDC that will provide care and suitable housing for any ill, injured, or abandoned animals prior to any animals being transported to the United States.

        (ii) As a condition of granting a waiver, CDC may require the airline to obtain the services of a licensed U.S. customs broker who will be responsible for coordinating on behalf of the airline the entry and clearance of any dogs imported into the United States, including compliance with CDC's requirements relating to the admission of dogs.

        (iii) As a condition of granting a waiver, CDC may require the airline to provide a timetable and identify steps that the airline will take to develop the technical capacity to generate an AWB (or another suitable alternative to an AWB) to transport dogs as cargo, checked-baggage, or hand-carried baggage.

        (iv) The Director may revoke a waiver granted to an airline upon notice to the airline and a finding that an airline has acted inconsistent with the terms of the waiver, including any provision of its SOP.

        (v) CDC may publish additional technical instructions on its website for airlines seeking a waiver from the bill of lading requirement.

        (3) Any dog arriving by air for which a bill of lading, including an AWB, has not been created by the airline prior to the dog's arrival in the United States will be denied admission and returned to the country of departure pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section, unless the airline transporting the dog has been granted a waiver and the airline's handling and transport of the dog are consistent with the terms of that waiver.

        (4) Airlines must deny boarding to any dogs for which the importer: has not presented to the airline before boarding a receipt confirming submission of the CDC dog import form; if the dogs are scheduled to arrive at a different U.S. port than the one listed on the receipt of the CDC dog import form; or if the dogs presented for travel do not match the description on the receipt of the CDC dog import form.

        (5) For U.S.-vaccinated dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months, airlines must deny boarding unless the importer presents prior to boarding a valid certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form or if the dogs presented for travel do not match the description on the certification of U.S.-issued rabies vaccination form.

        (6) For foreign-vaccinated dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country within the last six months, airlines must deny boarding unless the importer presents documentation to the airline before boarding of a reservation at a CDC-registered animal care facility and the dog is scheduled to arrive in the United States at the U.S. airport where the CDC-registered animal care facility is located.

        (7) For dogs from DMRVV-free or DMRVV low-risk countries, airlines must deny boarding unless the importer before boarding presents documentation as described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (u)(2) demonstrating that the dog is over six months of age, has a microchip, and has been only in DMRVV low-risk or DMRVV-free countries during the last six months. Airlines must also deny boarding if the dog presented for travel does not match the description on the documents presented by the importer for travel.

        (8) A representative of an airline transporting live dogs into the United States must be on-site at the U.S. airport and available to coordinate the entry/clearance of the dogs with Federal government officials until all live dogs transported on an arriving flight into the United States have either been cleared for entry or arrangements have been made to transport the dogs to a CDC-registered animal care facility or other facility ( veterinary clinic or kennel) approved by CDC pending an admissibility determination.

        (ee)  (1) If the Director determines that a carrier has endangered the public health of the United States by acting or failing to act to prevent the introduction of DMRVV, as would occur through failure to comply with any applicable provisions of this section, the Director may issue an order revoking the carrier's permission to transport live animals into the United States, which shall be served on the carrier's owner or operator.

        (2) The Director may rescind the order after inspecting the carrier's facilities; examining its records; conferring with the carrier's owners or operators, its contractors, or staff; or receiving information and written assurances from the carrier owner or operator that it has taken remedial steps to ensure future compliance with the requirements of this section.

        (3) A carrier owner or operator may appeal a revocation of a carrier's permission to transport live animals into the United States. The appeal shall be in writing, addressed to the Director, state the reasons for the appeal, and demonstrate that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute. The appeal must be submitted via email to

        (4) As soon as practicable after completing the written record review, the Director will issue a decision in writing that shall constitute final agency action, unless the Secretary, within one business day, decides to review the Director's decision. The Director will serve the carrier with a copy of the written decision.

        (ff)  (1) The Director may prohibit or otherwise restrict the import of dogs into the United States from certain countries designated as DMRVV-restricted countries. CDC will maintain a list of DMRVV-restricted countries based on the countries' prior export of dogs infected with DMRVV to any other countries within a time frame determined by CDC or based on inadequate controls, as determined by CDC, in the countries to monitor and prevent the export of dogs to the United States with falsified or fraudulent rabies vaccine credentials, invalid rabies vaccination certificates, or other fraudulent, inaccurate, or invalid exportation/importation documents.

        (l)  (1) The requirements of this paragraph (l) relating to quarantine facilities do not apply to laboratory-to-laboratory transfers or zoo-to-zoo transfers that are in compliance with paragraphs (p)(2) and (q)(2) of this section, respectively.

        (2) An importer must maintain a quarantine facility for holding a cohort during the required quarantine period. NHPs must be quarantined for 31 days after arrival at the importer's quarantine facility. HHS/CDC may extend the quarantine period if an importer or HHS/CDC finds or suspects that an NHP is infected with, or has been exposed to, a zoonotic disease, or if an importer or HHS/CDC finds a need for additional diagnostic testing.

        (i) For any quarantine facility established or maintained under this section, an importer must establish, implement, maintain, and adhere to SOPs that meet the following physical security requirements:

        (A) The facility must be locked and secure, with access limited to authorized, trained, and knowledgeable personnel.

        (B) An importer must limit access to NHP quarantine areas to authorized personnel who are responsible for the transport, study, care, or treatment of the NHPs.

        (ii) An importer must keep the number of workers involved in the care, transport, and inspection of NHPs to the minimum necessary to perform these functions.

        (iii) The facility must be designed and operated in such a manner as to allow for adequate disinfecting.

        (iv) The facility must have adequate equipment and space for discarding and disinfecting all equipment, clothing, and caging.

        (v) Each heating ventilation and air-conditioning unit in the quarantine facility must be designed so that there is no mixing of air among quarantine rooms and each quarantine room must remain under negative air pressure in relationship to the common hallway or anteroom(s) adjacent to the quarantine room.

        (vi) Each quarantine room must have air flow indicators (pressure gauges or visual flow indicators) that are affixed outside the quarantine room that indicate the direction of airflow into or out of quarantine rooms and adjoining common hallways and anterooms.

        (3) An importer must establish, implement, maintain, and adhere to SOPs for handling, monitoring, and testing NHPs in quarantine that meet the following requirements:

        (i) An importer must ensure that all NHPs are identified individually with a unique number or alphanumeric code permanently applied to the NHP by tattoo, microchip, or other permanent identifier before importation or after the 31-day quarantine. Tattoos, microchips, or other permanent identifiers must not be applied during the quarantine period.

        (ii) Health certificates, shipping documents, and NHP health records must include the number or code required in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section, as well as the age, sex, and species of the NHP.

        (iii) An importer must ensure NHPs are confined in a squeeze-back cage whenever possible and that any individual NHP is anesthetized, tranquilized, or otherwise restrained before handling.

        (iv) A description of handling and transporting samples. For any procedure involving the use of a syringe, a separate, disposable needle and syringe must be used, including a sterile needle and syringe for withdrawing medication from any multi-dose vials ( ketamine).

        (v) Before any contaminated item is removed from a quarantine facility, an importer must ensure that all NHP waste, bedding, uneaten food, or other possibly contaminated items are disinfected, autoclaved, or double-bagged for disposal as biomedical waste by a licensed facility.

        (vii) Any equipment used for infusion of NHPs must be autoclaved or incinerated, as appropriate.

        (viii) During the quarantine period, an importer must monitor NHPs for signs of any zoonotic illness, including signs consistent with yellow fever, monkeypox, or filovirus disease.

        (A) If any NHP appears ill during quarantine, an importer must monitor that NHP for signs of zoonotic illness, including filovirus disease, and ensure appropriate treatment.

        (B) If an Old World NHP displays signs suggestive of filovirus infection ( diarrhea with melena or frank blood, bleeding from external orifices or petechiae, or suffusive hemorrhage), and survives, an importer must collect serum samples on day 31 of quarantine and test these samples for antibodies to filovirus while the entire cohort remains in quarantine. An importer must test the serum for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to filovirus by using an ELISA methodology, or other method approved by HHS/CDC.

        (C) An importer must not knowingly request a release from HHS/CDC of any ill NHP from quarantine under paragraph (l)(4) of this section.

        (ix) For each NHP in a quarantine facility, an importer must administer at least three TSTs on the eyelid using old mammalian tuberculin (MOT), with at least 2 weeks between tests, before the NHP is released from import quarantine. TSTs must be read and recorded at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and a grading scale for interpretation of these tests must be listed in an SOP for TB testing.

        (A) An importer must ensure that any cohort with positive or suspicious TST reaction remains in quarantine and receives at least five additional TSTs (each administered at least two weeks apart) following removal of the last affected NHP.

        (B) The validity of TB test results may be compromised if during quarantine an NHP contracts a viral illness, including measles; is treated with steroids; or is immunized. An importer must document such occurrence(s) and hold the NHPs until they have recovered from the illness or are no longer on treatment, and for a recommended time after recovery (to be determined in consultation with HHS/CDC, depending on the illness or treatment in question) before TB tests are performed.

        (C) An importer must retain records of all TSTs performed during the lifetime of each NHP at the facility housing the NHP until the NHP is transferred to another facility. These records must accompany the NHP during moves to other facilities.

        (x) An importer must ensure that different cohorts of NHPs are quarantined in separate quarantine rooms.

        (A) If mixing of cohorts should occur, an importer must treat the mixed cohort as a single cohort.

        (B) All NHPs within that mixed cohort must remain in quarantine until each NHP in that mixed cohort has completed the minimum 31-day quarantine period.

        (C) Quarantined NHPs must be housed in such a manner that they do not expose non-quarantined NHPs to non-filtered air and other potentially infectious materials, including soiled bedding, caging, and other potentially contaminated items.

        (4) Before releasing a NHP from quarantine, an importer must obtain written permission from HHS/CDC. HHS/CDC may permit the release of a cohort from quarantine when all the following conditions have been met:

        (i) The 31-day quarantine period, including any required extension of quarantine, has been completed.

        (ii) HHS/CDC has confirmed receipt of written notification of the health status of the NHPs in the shipment from the quarantine facility's licensed veterinarian as required by paragraph (m)(4) of this section.

        (iii) HHS/CDC confirms that the importer has addressed and resolved to HHS/CDC's satisfaction any NHP or worker communicable disease issues that were reported to HHS/CDC during shipment.

        (5) If HHS/CDC notifies an importer of any evidence that NHPs have been exposed to a zoonotic disease, the importer must, at the importer's expense, implement or cooperate in the HHS/CDC's implementation of additional measures to rule out the spread of suspected zoonotic disease before releasing a shipment from quarantine, including examination, additional diagnostic procedures, treatment, detention, isolation, seizure, or destruction of exposed animals.

        (6) An importer must establish, implement, and adhere to SOPs for safe handling and necropsy of any NHP that dies in quarantine. The SOPs must ensure the following:

        (i) The carcass of the NHP must be placed in a waterproof double-bag and properly stored for necropsy, specimen collection, autoclaving and/or incineration, and disposal;

        (ii) A necropsy must be performed by a veterinary pathologist or state-licensed veterinarian. Each necropsy report must address all major organ systems and incorporate clinical history and laboratory findings;

        (iii) Necropsy and appropriate laboratory testing of the NHP must document the cause of death and/or rule out zoonotic illness;

        (iv) Necropsy must be performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) or enhanced biosafety level 2 “plus” (BSL2 + ) to protect against exposure to highly infectious agents;

        (v) Any samples of tissues, blood, serum, and/or transudates (bodily fluid) collected during necropsy must be retained until the NHP shipment has been released from quarantine by HHS/CDC, in case other testing is required by HHS/CDC;

        (vi) Fresh and formalin-fixed tissue specimens, including tracheobronchial lymph node, liver, lung, and spleen, regardless of necropsy findings, must be collected for laboratory examination;

        (vii) Any granulomatous lesions found in any NHP at necropsy, regardless of whether TB in the NHP was previously suspected, must be submitted to a laboratory for laboratory examination for acid-fast bacilli and for mycobacterial culture; and

        (viii) In the event that an Old World NHP dies or is euthanized for any reason other than trauma or unexpected adverse environmental conditions during quarantine, liver tissue for filovirus antigen by using the antigen-capture ELISA method must be submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. The laboratory should provide documentation of test validation and records of ongoing quality assurance.

#### § § 73.2

      This part implements the provisions of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 setting forth the requirements for possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins. The biological agents and toxins listed in this part have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal health, or to animal products. Overlap select agents and toxins are subject to regulation by both CDC and APHIS.

      § 73.3   HHS select agents and toxins.

#### § § 73.3

      (a) Except for exclusions under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the HHS Secretary has determined that the biological agents and toxins listed in this section have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. The select agents and toxins marked with an asterisk (*) are designated as Tier 1 select agents and toxins and are subject to additional requirements as listed in this part.

      (b) HHS select agents and toxins   are:

      (c) Genetic Elements, Recombinant and/or Synthetic Nucleic Acids, and Recombinant and/or Synthetic Organisms:

      (1) Nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any of the select agent viruses listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (i) Can be expressed  or , or

      (ii) Are in a vector or recombinant host genome and can be expressed  or

      (3) HHS select agents and toxins listed in paragraph (b) of this section that have been genetically modified.

      (d) HHS select agents or toxins that meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the requirements of this part:

      (1) Any HHS select agent or toxin that is in its naturally occurring environment provided the select agent or toxin has not been intentionally introduced, cultivated, collected, or otherwise extracted from its natural source.

      (2) Non-viable HHS select agents or nontoxic HHS toxins.

      (3) A select agent or toxin that has been subjected to decontamination or a destruction procedure when intended for waste disposal.

      (4) A select agent or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus that has been subjected to a validated inactivation procedure that is confirmed through a viability testing protocol. Surrogate strains that are known to possess equivalent properties with respect to inactivation can be used to validate an inactivation procedure; however, if there are known strain-to-strain variations in the resistance of a select agent to an inactivation procedure, then an inactivation procedure validated on a lesser resistant strain must also be validated on the more resistant strains.

      (5) Material containing a select agent that is subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is subjected to a viability testing protocol to ensure that the removal method has rendered the material free of all viable select agent.

      (6) A select agent or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus not subjected to a validated inactivation procedure or material containing a select agent not subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is determined by the HHS Secretary to be effectively inactivated or effectively removed. To apply for a determination an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information to CDC. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued.

      (*7*) Except as required in § 7*3*.*1**6*(l), the aggregate amount of the toxin under the control of a principal investigator, treating physician or veterinarian, or commercial manufacturer or distributor does not, at any time, exceed the following amounts: 1000 mg of Abrin; 1 mg of Botulinum neurotoxins; *2*00 mg of Conotoxins (Short, paralytic alpha conotoxins containing the following amino acid sequence XCCXPACGXXXXCX); 10,000 mg of Diacetoxyscirpenol; 1000 mg of Ricin; *5*00 mg of Saxitoxin; 100 mg of Staphylococcal enterotoxins (subtypes A-E); 10,000 mg of T-2 toxin; or 500 mg of Tetrodotoxin. Provided that,

      (i) The toxin is transferred only after the transferor uses due diligence and documents the identification of the recipient and the legitimate need ( prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose) claimed by the recipient to use such toxin. Information to be documented includes, but is not limited to, the recipient identity information, including the recipient's name, institution name, address, telephone number and email address; name of the toxin and the total amount transferred; and the legitimate need claimed by the recipient. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the HHS Secretary retains the authority to, without prior notification, inspect and copy or request the submission of the due diligence documentation to the CDC.

      (ii) Reports to CDC if they detect a known or suspected violation of Federal law or become aware of suspicious activity related to a toxin listed in this part.

      (8) An animal inoculated with or exposed to an HHS select toxin.

      Subpart A—Introduction

        § 81.0   Background.

#### § § 81.0

        The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), 42 U.S.C. 7384-7385 [1994, supp. 2001], provides for the payment of compensation benefits to covered employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees, of the United States Department of Energy, its predecessor agencies and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. Among the types of illnesses for which compensation may be provided are cancers. There are two categories of covered employees with cancer under EEOICPA for whom compensation may be provided. The regulations that follow under this part apply only to the category of employees described under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (a) One category is employees with cancer for whom probability of causation must be estimated or determined, as required under 20 CFR 30.115.

        (b) The second category is members of the Special Exposure Cohort seeking compensation for a specified cancer, as defined under EEOICPA. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) which has primary authority for implementing EEOICPA, has promulgated regulations at 20 CFR 30.210  that identify current members of the Special Exposure Cohort and requirements for compensation. Pursuant to section 7384(q) of EEOICPA, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to add additional classes of employees to the Special Exposure Cohort.

        § 81.1   Purpose and Authority.

#### § § 81.1

        (a) The purpose of this regulation is to establish guidelines DOL will apply to adjudicate cancer claims for covered employees seeking compensation for cancer, other than as members of the Special Exposure Cohort seeking compensation for a specified cancer. To award a claim, DOL must first determine that it is at least as likely as not that the cancer of the employee was caused by radiation doses incurred by the employee in the performance of duty. These guidelines provide the procedures DOL must apply and identify the information DOL will use.

        (b) Section 7384(n)(b) of EEOICPA requires the President to promulgate these guidelines. Executive Order 13179 assigned responsibility for promulgating these guidelines to the Secretary of HHS.

        § 81.2   Provisions of EEOICPA concerning this part.

#### § § 81.2

        EEOICPA imposes several general requirements concerning the development of these guidelines. It requires that the guidelines produce a determination as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that the cancer of the covered employee was related to radiation doses incurred by the employee in the performance of duty. It requires the guidelines be based on the radiation dose received by the employee, incorporating the methods of dose reconstruction to be established by HHS. It requires determinations be based on the upper 99 percent confidence interval (credibility limit) of the probability of causation in the RadioEpidemiological tables published under section 7(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (42 U.S.C. 241 note), as such tables may be updated. EEOICPA also requires HHS consider the type of cancer, past health-related activities, the risk of developing a radiation-related cancer from workplace exposure, and other relevant factors. Finally, it is important to note EEOICPA does not include a requirement limiting the types of cancers to be considered radiogenic for these guidelines.

      Subpart B—Definitions

        § 81.4   Definition of terms used in this part.

#### § § 81.4

        (a) Covered employee, for purposes of this part, means an individual who is or was an employee of DOE, a DOE contractor or subcontractor, or an atomic weapons employer, and for whom DOL has requested HHS to perform a dose reconstruction.

        (b)  means a factor applied to a risk model to modify the dose-risk relationship estimated by the model to account for the level of the dose and the rate at which the dose is incurred. As used in IREP, a DDREF value of greater than one implies that chronic or low doses are less carcinogenic per unit of dose than acute or higher doses.

        (c)  means a mathematical expression of the way that the risk of a biological effect (for example, cancer) changes with increased exposure to a potential health hazard (for example, ionizing radiation).

        (d)  means the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7384-7385 [1994, supp. 2001].

        (e)  means the absorbed dose in a tissue or organ multiplied by a radiation weighting factor to account for differences in the effectiveness of the radiation in inducing cancer.

        (f)  means the portion of the equivalent dose that is received from radiation sources outside of the body.

        (g)  means the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification,

        (h)  means a computer software program that uses information on the dose-response relationship, and specific factors such as a claimant's radiation exposure, gender, age at diagnosis, and age at exposure to calculate the probability of causation for a given pattern and level of radiation exposure.

        (i)  means the portion of the equivalent dose that is received from radioactive materials taken into the body.

        (j)  means a phenomenon in which the protraction of an exposure to a potential health hazard leads to greater biological effect per unit of dose than the delivery of the same total amount in a single dose. An inverse dose rate effect implies that the dose and dose rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) is less than one for chronic or low doses.

        (k)  means the average amount of energy transferred to surrounding body tissues per unit of distance the radiation travels through body tissues (track length). Low LET radiation is typified by gamma and x rays, which have high penetrating capabilities through various tissues, but transfer a relatively small amount of energy to surrounding tissue per unit of track length. High LET radiation includes alpha particles and neutrons, which have weaker penetrating capability but transfer a larger amount of energy per unit of track length.

        (l)  means the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services.

        (m)  means a cancer defined by the original body site at which the cancer was incurred, prior to any spread (metastasis) to other sites in the body.

        (n)  means the probability or likelihood that a cancer was caused by radiation exposure incurred by a covered employee in the performance of duty. In statistical terms, it is the cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure divided by the sum of the baseline cancer risk (the risk to the general population) plus the cancer risk attributable to the radiation exposure.

        (o)  means tables that allow computation of the probability of causation for various cancers associated with a defined exposure to radiation, after accounting for factors such as age at exposure, age at diagnosis, and time since exposure.

        (p)  means a factor applied to a risk model to account for differences between the amount of cancer effect produced by different forms of radiation. For purposes of EEOICPA, the RBE is considered equivalent to the radiation weighting factor.

        (q)  means a mathematical model used under EEOICPA to estimate a specific probability of causation using information on radiation dose, cancer type, and personal data (e.g., gender, smoking history).

        (r)  means a body site to which a primary cancer has spread (metastasized).

        (s)  is a term defined in § 7384(l)(17) of EEOICPA and 20 CFR 30.5(gg) that specifies types of cancer that, pursuant to 20 CFR part 30, may qualify a member of the Special Exposure Cohort for compensation. It includes leukemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancers, and cancers of the lung (other than carcinoma in situ diagnosed at autopsy), thyroid, male breast, female breast, esophagus, stomach, pharynx, small intestine, pancreas, bile ducts, gall bladder, salivary gland, urinary bladder, brain, colon, ovary, liver (not associated with cirrhosis or hepatitis B), and bone.

        (t)  is a term used in this rule to describe the lack of precision of a given estimate, the extent of which depends upon the amount and quality of the evidence or data available.

        (u)  is a statistical term meaning a range of discrete or continuous values arrayed around a central estimate, where each value is assigned a probability of being correct.

        (v)  is a term used in EEOICPA to mean credibility limit, the probability of causation estimate determined at the 99th percentile of the range of uncertainty around the central estimate of probability of causation.

      Subpart C—Data Required To Estimate Probability of Causation

        § 81.5   Use of personal and medical information.

#### § § 81.5

        Determining probability of causation may require the use of the following personal and medical information provided to DOL by claimants under DOL regulations 20 CFR part 30:

        (a) Year of birth.

        (b) Cancer diagnosis (by ICD-10-CM code) for primary and secondary cancers.

        (c) Date of cancer diagnosis.

        (d) Gender.

        (e) Race/ethnicity (if the claim is for skin cancer or a secondary cancer for which skin cancer is a likely primary cancer).

        (f) Smoking history (if the claim is for lung cancer or a secondary cancer for which lung cancer is a likely primary cancer).

> [67 FR 22309, May 2, 2002, as amended at 84 FR 37590, Aug. 1, 2019]

        § 81.6   Use of radiation dose information.

#### § § 81.6

        Determining probability of causation will require the use of radiation dose information provided to DOL by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under HHS regulations 42 CFR part 82. This information will include annual dose estimates for each year in which a dose was incurred, together with uncertainty distributions associated with each dose estimate. Dose estimates will be distinguished by type of radiation (low linear energy transfer (LET), protons, neutrons, alpha, low-energy x-ray) and by dose rate (acute or chronic) for external and internal radiation dose.

      Subpart D—Requirements for Risk Models Used To Estimate Probability of Causation

        § 81.10   Use of cancer risk assessment models in NIOSH IREP.

#### § § 81.10

        (a) The risk models used to estimate probability of causation for covered employees under EEOICPA will be based on risk models updated from the 1985 NIH Radioepidemiological Tables. These 1985 tables were developed from analyses of cancer mortality risk among the Japanese atomic bomb survivor cohort. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are updating the tables, replacing them with a sophisticated analytic software program. This program, the Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program (IREP)  , models the dose-response relationship between ionizing radiation and 33 cancers using morbidity data from the same Japanese atomic bomb survivor cohort. In the case of thyroid cancer, radiation risk models are based on a pooled analysis of several international cohorts  .

        (b) NIOSH will change the risk models in IREP, as needed, to reflect the radiation exposure and disease experiences of employees covered under EEOICPA, which differ from the experiences of the Japanese atomic bomb survivor cohort. Changes will be incorporated in a version of IREP named NIOSH-IREP, specifically designed for adjudication of claims under EEOICPA. Possible changes in IREP risk models include the following:

        (1) Addition of risk models to IREP, as needed, for claims under EEOICPA (e.g., malignant melanoma and other skin cancers)

        (2) Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate radiation exposures unique to employees covered by EEOICPA (e.g., radon and low energy x rays from employer-required medical screening programs, adjustment of relative biological effectiveness distributions based on neutron energy).

        (3) Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate new understanding of radiation-related cancer effects relevant to employees covered by EEOICPA (e.g., incorporation of inverse dose-rate relationship between high LET radiation exposures and cancer; adjustment of the low-dose effect reduction factor for acute exposures).

        (4) Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate new understanding of the potential interaction between cancer risk associated with occupational exposures to chemical carcinogens and radiation-related cancer effects.

        (5) Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate temporal, race and ethnicity-related differences in the frequency of certain cancers occurring generally among the U.S. population.

        (6) Modifications of IREP to facilitate improved evaluation of the uncertainty distribution for the probability of causation for claims based on two or more primary cancers.

        § 81.11   Use of uncertainty analysis in NIOSH-IREP.

#### § § 81.11

        (a) EEOICPA requires use of the uncertainty associated with the probability of causation calculation, specifically requiring the use of the upper 99% confidence interval (credibility limit) estimate of the probability of causation estimate. As described in the NCI document,   uncertainty from several sources is incorporated into the probability of causation calculation performed by NIOSH-IREP. These sources include uncertainties in estimating: radiation dose incurred by the covered employee; the radiation dose-cancer relationship (statistical uncertainty in the specific cancer risk model); the extrapolation of risk (risk transfer) from the Japanese to the U.S. population; differences in the amount of cancer effect caused by different radiation types (relative biological effectiveness or RBE); the relationship between the rate at which a radiation dose is incurred and the level of cancer risk produced (dose and dose rate effectiveness factor or DDREF); and, the role of non-radiation risk factors (such as smoking history).

        (b) NIOSH-IREP will operate according to the same general protocol as IREP for the analysis of uncertainty. It will address the same possible sources of uncertainty affecting probability of causation estimates, and in most cases will apply the same assumptions incorporated in IREP risk models. Different procedures and assumptions will be incorporated into NIOSH-IREP as needed, according to the criteria outlined under § 81.10.

        § 81.12   Procedure to update NIOSH-IREP.

#### § § 81.12

        (a) NIOSH may periodically revise NIOSH-IREP to add, modify, or replace cancer risk models, improve the modeling of uncertainty, and improve the functionality and user-interface of NIOSH-IREP.

        (b) Revisions to NIOSH-IREP may be recommended by the following sources:

        (1) NIOSH,

        (2) The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health,

        (3) Independent reviews of NIOSH-IREP or elements thereof by scientific organizations (e.g., National Academy of Sciences),

        (4) DOL,

        (5) Public comment.

        (c) NIOSH will submit substantive changes to NIOSH-IREP (changes that would substantially affect estimates of probability of causation calculated using NIOSH-IREP, including the addition of new cancer risk models) to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health for review. NIOSH will obtain such review and address any recommendations of the review before completing and implementing the change.

        (d) NIOSH will inform the public of proposed changes provided to the Advisory Board for review. HHS will provide instructions for obtaining relevant materials and providing public comment in the notice announcing the Advisory Board meeting, published in the

        (e) NIOSH will publish periodically a notice in the  informing the public of proposed substantive changes to NIOSH-IREP currently under development, the status of the proposed changes, and the expected completion dates.

        (f) NIOSH will notify DOL and publish a notice in the  notifying the public of the completion and implementation of substantive changes to NIOSH-IREP. In the notice, NIOSH will explain the effect of the change on estimates of probability of causation and will summarize and address relevant comments received by NIOSH.

        (g) NIOSH may take into account other factors and employ other procedures than those specified in this section, if circumstances arise that require NIOSH to implement a change more immediately than the procedures in this section allow.

      Subpart E—Guidelines To Estimate Probability of Causation

        § 81.20   Required use of NIOSH-IREP.

#### § § 81.20

        (a) NIOSH-IREP is an interactive software program for estimating probability of causation for covered employees seeking compensation for cancer under EEOICPA, other than as members of the Special Exposure Cohort seeking compensation for a specified cancer.

        (b) DOL is required to use NIOSH-IREP to estimate probability of causation for all cancers, as identified under §§ 81.21 and 81.23.

        § 81.21   Cancers requiring the use of NIOSH-IREP.

#### § § 81.21

        (a) DOL will calculate probability of causation for all cancers using NIOSH-IREP.

      Subpart A—Introduction

        § 82.0   Background information on this part.

#### § § 82.0

        The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), 42 U.S.C. 7384-7385 [1994, supp. 2001], provides for the payment of compensation benefits to covered employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees, of the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”), its predecessor agencies and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. Among the types of illnesses for which compensation may be provided are cancers. There are two categories of covered employees with cancer under EEOICPA for whom compensation may be provided. The regulations that follow under this part apply only to the category of employees described under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (a) One category is employees with cancer for whom a dose reconstruction must be conducted, as required under 20 CFR 30.115.

        (b) The second category is members of the Special Exposure Cohort seeking compensation for a specified cancer, as defined under EEOICPA. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) which has primary authority for implementing EEOICPA, has promulgated regulations at 20 CFR 30.210 and 30.213 that identify current members of the Special Exposure Cohort and requirements for compensation. Pursuant to section 3626 of EEOICPA, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to add additional classes of employees to the Special Exposure Cohort.

        § 82.1   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 82.1

        The purpose of this part is to provide methods for determining a reasonable estimate of the radiation dose received by a covered employee with cancer under EEOICPA, through the completion of a dose reconstruction. These methods will be applied by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in a dose reconstruction program serving claimants under EEOICPA, as identified under § 82.0.

        § 82.2   What are the basics of dose reconstruction?

#### § § 82.2

        The basic principle of dose reconstruction is to characterize the radiation environments to which workers were exposed and to then place each worker in time and space within this exposure environment. Then methods are applied to translate exposure to radiation into quantified radiation doses at the specific organs or tissues relevant to the types of cancer occurring among the workers. A hierarchy of methods is used in a dose reconstruction, depending on the nature of the exposure conditions and the type, quality, and completeness of data available to characterize the environment.

        (a) If found to be complete and adequate, individual worker monitoring data, such as dosimeter readings and bioassay sample results, are given the highest priority in assessing exposure. These monitoring data are interpreted using additional data characterizing the workplace radiation exposures. If radiation exposures in the workplace environment cannot be fully characterized based on available data, default values based on reasonable and scientific assumptions may be used as substitutes. For dose reconstructions conducted in occupational illness compensation programs, this practice may include use of assumptions that represent the worst case conditions. For example, if the solubility classification of an inhaled material can not be determined, the dose reconstruction would use the classification that results in the largest dose to the organ or tissue relevant to the cancer and that is possible given existing knowledge of the material and process.

        (b) If individual monitoring data are not available or adequate, dose reconstructions may use monitoring results for groups of workers with comparable activities and relationships to the radiation environment. Alternatively, workplace area monitoring data may be used to estimate the dose. As with individual worker monitoring data, workplace exposure characteristics are used in combination with workplace monitoring data to estimate dose.

        (c) If neither adequate worker nor workplace monitoring data are available, the dose reconstruction may rely substantially on process description information to analytically develop an exposure model. For internal exposures, this model includes such factors as the quantity and composition of the radioactive substance (the source term), the chemical form, particle size distribution, the level of containment, and the likelihood of dispersion.

        § 82.3   What Are the Requirements for Dose Reconstruction Under EEOICPA?

#### § § 82.3

        (a) Dose reconstructions are to be conducted for the following covered employees with cancer seeking compensation under EEOICPA: An employee who was not monitored for exposure to radiation at DOE or Atomic Weapons Employer (AWE) facilities; an employee who was monitored inadequately for exposure to radiation at such facilities; or an employee whose records of exposure to radiation at such facility are missing or incomplete. Technical limitations of radiation monitoring technology and procedures will require HHS to evaluate each employee's recorded dose. In most, if not all cases, monitoring limitations will result in possibly undetected or unrecorded doses, which are estimated using commonly practiced dose reconstruction methods and would have to be added to the dose record.

        (b) Section 7384(n)(e) of EEOICPA requires the reporting of radiation dose information resulting from dose reconstructions to the covered employees for whom claims are being adjudicated. DOE is specifically charged with this responsibility but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which will be producing the dose reconstruction information, will report its findings directly to the claimant, as well as to DOL and DOE. HHS will also make available to researchers and the general public information on the assumptions, methodology, and data used in estimating radiation doses, as required by EEOICPA.

        § 82.4   How Will DOL Use the Results of the NIOSH Dose Reconstructions?

#### § § 82.4

        Under 42 CFR part 81, DOL will apply dose reconstruction results together with information on cancer diagnosis and other personal information provided to DOL by the claimant to calculate an estimated probability of causation. This estimate is the probability that the cancer of the covered employee was caused by radiation exposure at a covered facility of DOE or an Atomic Weapons Employer (AWE).

      Subpart B—Definitions

        § 82.5   Definition of terms used in this part.

#### § § 82.5

        (a)  (AWE) means any entity, other than the United States, that:

        (1) processed or produced, for use by the United States, material that emitted radiation and was used in the production of an atomic weapon, excluding uranium mining and milling; and,

        (2) is designated by the Secretary of Energy as an atomic weapons employer for purposes of EEOICPA.

        (b)  means the determination of the kinds, quantities, or concentrations, and in some cases, locations of radioactive material in the human body, whether by direct measurement or by analysis, and evaluation of radioactive material excreted or eliminated by the body.

        (c)  means the individual who has filed with the Department of Labor for compensation under EEOICPA.

        (d)  means, for the purposes of this part, an individual who is or was an employee of DOE, a DOE contractor or subcontractor, or an atomic weapons employer, and for whom DOL has requested HHS to perform a dose reconstruction.

        (e)  means any building, structure, or premises, including the grounds upon which such building, structure, or premise is located:

        (1) In which operations are, or have been, conducted by, or on behalf of, the DOE (except for buildings, structures, premises, grounds, or operations covered by Executive Order 12344, dated February 1, 1982, pertaining to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program); and,

        (2) With regard to which the DOE has or had:

        (i) A proprietary interest; or,

        (ii) Entered into a contract with an entity to provide management and operation, management and integration, environmental remediation services, construction, or maintenance services; or

        (3) A facility owned by an entity designated by the Secretary of Energy as an atomic weapons employer for purposes of EEOICPA that is or was used to process or produce, for use by the United States, material that emitted radiation and was used in the production of an atomic weapon, excluding uranium mining or milling.

        (f)  means the U.S. Department of Energy, and includes predecessor agencies of _DOE_, including the Manhattan Engineering District.

        (g)  means the U.S. Department of Labor.

        (h)  means the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. 7384-7385 [1994, supp. 2001].

        (i)  is the absorbed dose in a tissue multiplied by a radiation weighting factor to account for differences in the effectiveness of the radiation in inducing cancer.

        (j)  means that portion of the equivalent dose that is received from radiation sources outside of the body.

        (r)  is a term used to describe a type of assumption used in certain instances for certain dose reconstructions conducted under this rule. It assigns the highest reasonably possible value, based on reliable science, documented experience, and relevant data, to a radiation dose of a covered employee.

      Subpart C—Dose Reconstruction Process

        § 82.10   Overview of the dose reconstruction process.

#### § § 82.10

        (a) Upon receipt of a claims package from the Department of Labor, as provided under 20 CFR part 30, NIOSH will request from DOE records on radiation dose monitoring and radiation exposures associated with the employment history of the covered employee. Additionally, NIOSH may compile data, and information from NIOSH records that may contribute to the dose reconstruction. For each dose reconstruction, NIOSH will include records relevant to internal and external exposures to ionizing radiation, including exposures from medical screening x rays that were required as a condition of employment.

        (b) NIOSH will evaluate the initial radiation exposure record compiled to: Reconcile the exposure record with the reported employment history, as necessary; complete preliminary calculations of dose, based upon this initial record, and prepare to consult with the claimant. Any discrepancies in the employment history information will be reconciled with the assistance of DOE, as necessary.

        (c) NIOSH will interview the claimant. The interview may be conducted in one or more sessions. The purpose of the interview is to:

        (1) Explain the dose reconstruction process;

        (2) Confirm elements of the employment history transmitted to NIOSH by DOL;

        (3) Identify any relevant information on employment history that may have been omitted;

        (4) Confirm or supplement monitoring information included in the initial radiation exposure record;

        (5) Develop detailed information on work tasks, production processes, radiologic protection and monitoring practices, and incidents that may have resulted in undocumented radiation exposures, as necessary;

        (6) Identify co-workers and other witnesses with information relevant to the radiation exposures of the covered worker to supplement or confirm information on work experiences, as necessary.

        (d) NIOSH will provide a report to the claimant summarizing the findings of the interview, titled: “NIOSH Claimant Interview under EEOICPA.” The report will also notify the claimant of the opportunity to contact NIOSH if necessary, by a specified date, to make any written corrections or additions to information provided by the claimant during the interview process.

        (e) Information provided by the claimant will be accepted and used for dose reconstruction, providing it is reasonable, supported by substantial evidence, and is not refuted by other evidence. In assessing whether the information provided by the claimant is supported by substantial evidence, NIOSH will consider:

        (1) Consistency of the information with other information in the possession of NIOSH, from radiation safety programs, research, medical screening programs, labor union documents, worksite investigations, dose reconstructions conducted by NIOSH under EEOICPA, or other reports relating to the circumstances at issue;

        (2) Consistency of the information with medical records provided by the claimant;

        (3) Consistency of the information with practices or exposures demonstrated by the dose reconstruction record developed for the claimant; and,

        (4) Confirmation of information by co-workers or other witnesses.

        (f) NIOSH will seek to confirm information provided by the claimant through review of available records and records requested from DOE.

        (g) As necessary, NIOSH will request additional records from DOE to characterize processes and tasks potentially involving radiation exposure for which dose and exposure monitoring data is incomplete or insufficient for dose reconstruction.

        (h) NIOSH will review the adequacy of monitoring data and completeness of records provided by DOE. NIOSH will request certification from DOE that record searches requested by NIOSH have been completed.

        (i) As necessary, NIOSH will characterize the internal and external exposure environments for parameters known to influence the dose. For internal exposures, examples of these parameters include the mode of intake, the composition of the source term (i.e., the radionuclide type and quantity), the particle size distribution and the absorption type. When it is not possible to characterize these parameters, NIOSH may use default values, when they can be established reasonably, fairly, and based on relevant science. For external exposures, the radiation type (gamma, x-ray, neutron, beta, or other charged particle) and radiation energy spectrum will be evaluated. When possible, the effect of non-uniformity and geometry of the radiation exposure will be assessed.

        (j) For individual monitoring records that are incomplete, NIOSH may assign doses using techniques discussed in § 82.16. Once the resulting data set is complete, NIOSH will construct an occupational exposure matrix, using the general hierarchical approach discussed in § 82.2. This matrix will contain the estimated annual equivalent dose(s) to the relevant organ(s) or tissue(s), for the period from the initial date of potential exposure at a covered facility until the date the cancer was diagnosed. The equivalent dose(s) will be calculated using the current, standard radiation weighting factors from the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

        (k) At any point during steps of dose reconstruction described in paragraphs (f) through (j) of this section, NIOSH may determine that sufficient research and analysis has been conducted to complete the dose reconstruction. Research and analysis will be determined sufficient if one of the following three conditions is met:

        (1) From acquired experience, it is evident the estimated cumulative dose is sufficient to qualify the claimant for compensation ( the dose produces a probability of causation of 50% or greater);

        (2) Dose is determined using worst-case assumptions related to radiation exposure and intake, to substitute for further research and analyses; or,

        (3) Research and analysis indicated under steps described in paragraphs (f)-(j) of this section have been completed. Worst-case assumptions will be employed under condition 2 to limit further research and analysis only for claims for which it is evident that further research and analysis will not produce a compensable level of radiation dose (a dose producing a probability of causation of 50% or greater), because using worst-case assumptions it can be determined that the employee could not have incurred a compensable level of radiation dose. For all claims in which worst-case assumptions are employed under condition 2, the reasoning that resulted in the determination to limit further research and analysis will be clearly described in the draft of the dose reconstruction results reported to the claimant under § 82.25 and in the dose reconstruction results reported to the claimant under § 82.26.

        (l) After providing the claimant with a copy of a draft of the dose reconstruction report to be provided to DOL, NIOSH will conduct a closing interview with the claimant to review the dose reconstruction results and the basis upon which the results were calculated. This will be the final opportunity during the dose reconstruction process for the claimant to provide additional relevant information that may affect the dose reconstruction. The closing interview may require multiple sessions, if the claimant requires time to obtain and provide additional information, and to allow NIOSH time to integrate the new information into a new draft of the dose reconstruction report. NIOSH will determine whether to grant requests for time to provide additional information, based on whether the requests are reasonable and the claimant is actively seeking the information specified.

        (m) Subject to any additional information provided by the claimant and revision of the draft dose reconstruction report under § 82.10(l), the claimant is required to return form OCAS-1 to NIOSH, certifying that the claimant has completed providing information and that the record for dose reconstruction should be closed. Upon receipt of the form, NIOSH will forward a final dose reconstruction report to DOL, DOE, and to the claimant.

        (n) NIOSH will not forward the dose reconstruction report to DOL for adjudication without receipt of form OCAS-1 signed by the claimant or a representative of the claimant authorized pursuant to 20 CFR 30.600. If the claimant or the authorized representative of the claimant fails to sign and return form OCAS-1 within 60 days, or 60 days following the claimant's final provision of additional information and receipt of a revised draft dose reconstruction report under § 82.10 (l), whichever occurs last, after notifying the claimant or the authorized representative, NIOSH may administratively close the dose reconstruction and notify DOL of this action. Upon receiving this notification by NIOSH, DOL may administratively close the claim.

        (o) Once actions under § 82.10 (m) are completed, the record for dose reconstruction shall be closed unless reopened at the request of DOL under 20 CFR part 30.

        § 82.11   For which claims under EEOICPA will NIOSH conduct a dose reconstruction?

#### § § 82.11

        NIOSH will conduct a dose reconstruction for each claim determined by DOL to be a claim for a covered employee with cancer under DOL regulations at 20 CFR 30.210(b), subject to the limitation and exception noted in § 82.12. Claims for covered employees who are members of the Special Exposure Cohort seeking compensation for a specified cancer, as determined by DOL under 20 CFR 30.210(a), do not require and will not receive a dose reconstruction under this rule.

        § 82.12   Will it be possible to conduct dose reconstructions for all claims?

#### § § 82.12

        It is uncertain whether adequate information of the types outlined under § 82.14 will be available to complete a dose reconstruction for every claim eligible under § 82.11.

        (a) NIOSH will notify in writing any claimants for whom a dose reconstruction cannot be completed once that determination is made, as well as in the closing interview provided for under § 82.10(l).

        (b) Notification will describe the basis for finding a dose reconstruction cannot be completed, including the following:

        (1) A summary of the information obtained from DOE and other sources; and, (2) a summary of necessary information found to be unavailable from DOE and other sources.

        (c) NIOSH will notify DOL and DOE when it is unable to complete a dose reconstruction for the claimant. This will result in DOL producing a recommended decision to deny the claim, since DOL cannot determine probability of causation without a dose estimate produced by NIOSH under this rule.

        (d) A claimant for whom a dose reconstruction cannot be completed, as indicated under this section, may have recourse to seek compensation under provisions of the Special Exposure Cohort (see 20 CFR part 30). Pursuant to section 7384q of EEOICPA, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to add classes of employees to the Special Exposure Cohort. NIOSH will provide the claimant with any information and forms that HHS provides to classes of employees seeking to petition to be added to the Special Exposure Cohort.

        § 82.13   What sources of information may be used for dose reconstructions?

#### § § 82.13

        NIOSH will use the following sources of information for dose reconstructions, as necessary:

        (a) DOE and its contractors, including Atomic Weapons Employers and the former worker medical screening program;

        (b) NIOSH and other records from health research on DOE worker populations;

        (c) Interviews and records provided by claimants;

        (e) Labor union records from unions representing employees at covered facilities of DOE or AWEs; and,

        (f) Any other relevant information.

        § 82.14   What types of information could be used in dose reconstructions?

        (4) Bioassay sample and dosimeter collection/exchange frequencies;

        (5) Documentation of record keeping practices used to record data and/or administratively assign dose; and,

        (6) Other information to characterize the monitoring program procedures and evaluate monitoring results.

        (e)  including:

        (1) Surface contamination surveys;

        (2) General area air sampling results;

        (f)  including:

        (1) Information on the external exposure environment, including: radiation type (gamma, x-ray, proton, neutron, beta, other charged particle); radiation energy spectrum; uniformity of exposure (whole body vs partial body exposure); irradiation geometry;

        (2) Information on work-required medical screening x rays; and,

        (3) Other information useful for characterizing workplace radiation exposures.

        (g)  including:

        (4) Methods of containment;

        (5) Other information to assess potential for irradiation by source or airborne dispersion radioactive material.

        § 82.15   How will NIOSH evaluate the completeness and adequacy of individual monitoring data?

#### § § 82.15

        (a) NIOSH will evaluate the completeness and adequacy of an individual's monitoring data provided by DOE through one or more possible measures including, but not limited to:

        (1) Comparisons with information provided by claimants, co-workers, and other witnesses;

        (2) Comparisons with available information on area monitoring, production processes, and radiologic protection programs;

        (3) Comparisons with information documented in the records of unions representing covered employees;

        (4) Comparisons with data available on co-workers; and

        (5) Reviews of DOE contractor record systems.

        (b) NIOSH will evaluate the instruments and procedures used to collect individual monitoring data to determine whether they adequately characterized the radiation environments in which the covered employee worked, (adequately for the purpose of dose reconstruction,) based on present-day scientific understanding. For external dosimeter measurements, this includes an evaluation of the dosimeter response to the radiation types (gamma, x-ray, neutron, beta, or other charged particle) and the associated energy spectrum. For internal exposure, the methods used to analyze bioassay samples will be reviewed to determine their ability to detect the radionuclides present in the work environment. An analysis of the monitoring or exchange frequencies for the monitoring programs will also be conducted to determine the potential for undetected dose.

        § 82.16   How will NIOSH add to monitoring data to remedy limitations of individual monitoring and missed dose?

#### § § 82.16

        (a) For external dosimeter results that are incomplete due to historical record keeping practices, NIOSH will use commonly practiced techniques, such as those described in the NIOSH Research Issues Workshop,   to estimate the missing component of dose and to add this to the total dose estimate. For monitoring periods where external dosimetry data are missing from the records, NIOSH will estimate a claimant's dose based on interpolation, using available monitoring results from other time periods close to the period in question, or based on monitoring data on other workers engaged in similar tasks.

        (b) NIOSH will review historical bioassay sample detection limits and monitoring frequencies to determine, when possible, the minimum detectable dose for routine internal dose monitoring programs. This “missed dose” will establish the upper limit of internal dose that a worker could have received for periods when bioassay sample analysis results were below the detection limit. Using ICRP biokinetic models, NIOSH will estimate the internal dose and include an associated uncertainty distribution.

        § 82.17   What types of information could be used to supplement or substitute for individual monitoring data?

#### § § 82.17

        Three types of information could be used:

        (a) Monitoring data from co-workers, if NIOSH determines they had a common relationship to the radiation environment; or,

        (b) A quantitative characterization of the radiation environment in which the covered employee worked, based on an analysis of historical workplace monitoring information such as area dosimeter readings, general area radiation and radioactive contamination survey results, air sampling data; or,

        (c) A quantitative characterization of the radiation environment in which the employee worked, based on analysis of data describing processes involving radioactive materials, the source materials, occupational tasks and locations, and radiation safety practices.

        § 82.18   How will NIOSH calculate internal dose to the primary cancer site(s)?

#### § § 82.18

        (a) The calculation of dose from ingested, inhaled or absorbed radioactivity involves the determination of the types and quantities of radionuclides that entered the body. NIOSH will use the results of all available bioassay monitoring information as appropriate, based on assessment of the technical characteristics of the monitoring program. If bioassay monitoring data are unavailable or inadequate, the dose reconstruction will rely on the results of air sampling measurements, radiation sources, work processes and practices, and incidents involving radiation contamination, as necessary.

        (b) NIOSH will calculate the dose to the organ or tissue of concern using the appropriate current metabolic models published by ICRP. Using data available to NIOSH, the models will be based on exposure conditions representative of the work environment. When NIOSH cannot establish exposure conditions with sufficient specificity, the dose calculation will assume exposure conditions that maximize the dose to the organ under consideration. When the cancer covered by a claim is in a tissue not covered by existing ICRP models, NIOSH will use the ICRP model that best approximates the model needed, while giving the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. For internal exposures, NIOSH will select the highest dose estimate from among the modeled organs or tissues that do not concentrate the radionuclide.

        (c) Internal doses will be calculated for each year of exposure from the date of initial exposure to the date of cancer diagnosis.

        § 82.19   How will NIOSH address uncertainty about dose levels?

#### § § 82.19

        The estimate of each annual dose will be characterized with a probability distribution that accounts for the uncertainty of the estimate. This information will be used by DOL in the calculation of probability of causation, under HHS guidelines for calculating probability of causation estimates at 42 CFR 81. In this way, claimants will receive the benefit of the doubt in cases in which the actual dose may have exceeded the best estimate calculated by NIOSH.

      Subpart D—Reporting and Review of Dose Reconstruction Results

        § 82.25   When will NIOSH report dose reconstruction results, and to whom?

#### § § 82.25

        NIOSH will report dose reconstruction results to DOL and to the claimant, as provided for under § 82.10. Draft results will be reported to the claimant upon tentative completion of the dose reconstruction. Final results will be reported to the claimant, DOL and DOE after NIOSH receives certification from the claimant that the claimant has completed providing information to NIOSH for the dose reconstruction (Form OCAS-1).

        § 82.26   How will NIOSH report dose reconstruction results?

#### § § 82.26

        (a) NIOSH will provide dose reconstruction results to the claimant, DOL, and DOE in a report: “NIOSH Report of Dose Reconstruction under EEOICPA.” The report itself will not provide information on probability of causation, which DOL must calculate to determine a recommended decision on the claim.

        (b) The report will include the following information, as relevant:

        (1) Annual dose estimates (or a fraction thereof) related to covered employment for each year from the date of initial radiation exposure at a covered facility to the date of cancer diagnosis;

        (2) Separate dose estimates for acute and chronic exposures, different types of ionizing radiation, and internal and external doses, providing internal dose information only for the organ or tissue relevant to the primary cancer site(s) established in the claim;

        (3) Uncertainty distributions associated with each dose estimated, as necessary;

        (4) Explanation of each type of dose estimate included in terms of its relevance for estimating probability of causation;

        (5) Identification of any information provided by the claimant relevant to dose estimation that NIOSH decided to omit from the basis for dose reconstruction, justification for the decision, and if possible, a quantitative estimate of the effect of the omission on the dose reconstruction results; and

        (6) A summary and explanation of information and methods applied to produce the dose reconstruction estimates, including any factual findings and the evidence upon which those findings are based.

        (c) As provided under § 82.10(l), NIOSH staff will conduct a closing interview with claimants to explain the dose reconstruction report.

        § 82.27   How can claimants obtain reviews of their NIOSH dose reconstruction results by NIOSH?

#### § § 82.27

        (a) Claimants can seek reviews of their dose reconstruction through the processes established by DOL under 20 CFR 30. DOL will request NIOSH to review dose reconstructions under the following conditions, as provided under 20 CFR 30.318:

        (1) DOL may determine that factual findings of the dose reconstruction do not appear to be supported by substantial evidence; or,

        (2) Although the methodology established by HHS under this Part is binding on DOL, DOL may determine that arguments concerning the  of this methodology should be considered by NIOSH.

        (b) NIOSH may review completed dose reconstructions on its own initiative and with the assistance of DOL to identify denied claims when either of the following circumstances arise:

        (1) NIOSH obtains records or information on radiation exposures of DOE or AWE employees that could substantially increase the level of radiation doses estimated in the completed dose reconstructions; or

        (2) NIOSH changes a scientific element underlying dose reconstructions according to the provisions of Subpart E of this rule and the change could substantially increase the level of radiation doses estimated in the completed dose reconstructions.

        (c) When NIOSH completes the review of a dose reconstruction, NIOSH will provide a report describing the basis for the review, the methods employed in the review, and the review findings to the claimant, DOL, and DOE.

        § 82.28   Who can review NIOSH dose reconstruction files on individual claimants?

#### § § 82.28

        (a) Claimants and DOL will be provided individual dose reconstruction files, upon request. Claimants should note, however, that a complete summary of the data and methods used in a dose reconstruction will be included in the “NIOSH Report of Dose Reconstruction under EEOICPA”.

        (b) Researchers and the public will be provided limited access to NIOSH dose reconstruction files, subject to provisions and restrictions of the Privacy Act for the protection of confidential information on individuals.

      Subpart E—Updating the Scientific Elements Underlying Dose Reconstructions

        § 82.30   How will NIOSH inform the public of any plans to change scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process to maintain methods reasonably current with scientific progress?

#### § § 82.30

        Periodically, NIOSH will publish a notice in the  notifying the public of plans to change scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process under EEOICPA to reflect scientific progress. Notice will include a summary of the planned changes and the expected completion date for such changes.

        § 82.31   How can the public recommend changes to scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process?

#### § § 82.31

        (a) At any time, the public can submit written recommendations to NIOSH for changes to scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process, based on relevant new research findings and technological advances. NIOSH will provide these recommendations to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to be addressed at a public meeting of the Advisory Board, with notification provided to the source of the recommendations. Recommendations should be addressed to: Director, Office of Compensation Analysis and Support, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 4676 Columbia Parkway, MS-R45, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226.

        (b) The public can also submit recommendations by e-mail. Instructions will be provided on the NIOSH Internet homepage at

        § 82.32   How will NIOSH make changes in scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process, based on scientific progress?

#### § § 82.32

        NIOSH will present proposed changes to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health prior to implementation. These proposed changes will be summarized in a notice published in the  The public will have the opportunity to comment on proposed changes at the meeting of the Advisory Board and/or in written comments submitted for this purpose. NIOSH will fully consider the comments of the Advisory Board and of the public before deciding upon any changes.

        § 82.33   How will NIOSH inform the public of changes to the scientific elements underlying the dose reconstruction process?

#### § § 82.33

        (a) NIOSH will publish a notice in the  informing the public of changes and the rationale for the changes. This notice will also provide a summary of the recommendations and comments received from the Advisory Board and the public, as well as responses to the comments.

        (b) NIOSH may take into account other factors and employ other procedures than those specified in this subpart, if circumstances arise that require NIOSH to implement a change more immediately than the procedures in this subpart allow.

    PART 83—PROCEDURES FOR DESIGNATING CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES AS MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM ACT OF 2000

### Part 83

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7384q; E.O. 13179, 65 FR 77487, 3 CFR, 2000 Comp., p. 321.

**Source:** Source: 69 FR 30780, May 28, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Introduction

        § 83.0   Background information on the procedures in this part.

#### § § 83.0

        The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, as amended (“EEOICPA” or “the Act”), 42 U.S.C. 7384-7385, provides for the payment of compensation benefits to covered employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees, of DOE, its predecessor agencies and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. Among the types of illnesses for which compensation may be provided are cancers. There are two methods set forth in the statute for claimants to establish that a cancer incurred by a covered worker is compensable under EEOICPA. The first is to establish that the cancer is at least as likely as not related to covered employment at a DOE or Atomic Weapons Employer (“AWE”) facility pursuant to guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), which are found at 42 CFR part 81. The second method to establish that a cancer incurred by a covered worker is compensable under EEOICPA is to establish that the worker is a member of the Special Exposure Cohort (“the Cohort”) and suffered a specified cancer after beginning employment at a DOE facility or AWE facility. In Section 3621(14) of EEOICPA (42 U.S.C. 7384l(14)) Congress included certain classes of employees in the Cohort. Section 3626 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384q) authorizes the addition to the Cohort of other classes of employees. This authority has been delegated to the Secretary of HHS by Executive Order 13179.

        § 83.1   What is the purpose of the procedures in this part?

#### § § 83.1

        EEOICPA authorizes the President to add classes of employees to the Cohort, while providing Congress with the opportunity to review and expedite or reverse these decisions. The President delegated his authority to the Secretary of HHS. This part specifies the procedures by which HHS will determine whether to add new classes of employees from DOE and AWE facilities to the Cohort. HHS will consider adding new classes of employees in response to petitions by, or on behalf of, such classes of employees. The procedures specify requirements for petitions and for their consideration. These requirements are intended to ensure that petitions are submitted by authorized parties, are justified, and receive uniform, fair, scientific consideration. The procedures are also designed to give petitioners and interested parties opportunity for appropriate involvement in the process, and to ensure that the process is timely and consistent with requirements specified in EEOICPA. The procedures are not intended to provide a second opportunity to qualify a claim for compensation, once HHS has completed the dose reconstruction and DOL has determined that the cancer subject to the claim was not “at least as likely as not” caused by the estimated radiation doses. DOL has established procedures separate from those covered by this part, under 20 CFR part 30, for cancer claimants who want to contest the factual determinations or how NIOSH conducted their dose reconstructions.

        § 83.2   How will DOL use the designations established under the procedures in this part?

#### § § 83.2

        DOL will adjudicate compensation claims for members of classes of employees added to the Cohort according to the same general procedures that apply to the statutorily defined classes of employees in the Cohort. Specifically, DOL will determine whether the claim is for a qualified member of the Cohort with a specified cancer, pursuant to the procedures set forth in 20 CFR part 30.

      Subpart B—Definitions

        § 83.5   Definitions of terms used in the procedures in this part.

      Subpart C—Procedures for Adding Classes of Employees to the Cohort

        § 83.6   Overview of the procedures in this part.

#### § § 83.6

        The procedures in this part specify who may petition to add a class of employees to the Cohort, the requirements for such a petition, how a petition will be selected for evaluation by NIOSH and for the advice of the Board, and the process NIOSH, the Board, and the Secretary will use to consider a petition, leading to the Secretary's final determination to accept or deny adding a class to the Cohort. The rule provides for petitions in two distinct circumstances. One circumstance is when NIOSH has attempted to conduct a dose reconstruction for a cancer claimant, under 42 CFR part 82, and finds that the dose reconstruction cannot be completed, because there is insufficient information to estimate the radiation doses of the claimant with sufficient accuracy. The second circumstance includes all other possibilities. For example, a petition may be submitted representing a class of employees whose members have yet to file claims under EEOICPA, or even have yet to be diagnosed with cancer. As required by EEOICPA (42 U.S.C. 7384l(14)(c)(ii)), the procedures in this part include formal notice to Congress of any decision by the Secretary to add a class to the Cohort, and the opportunity for Congress to expedite or change the outcome of the decision within 180 days.

        § 83.7   Who can submit a petition on behalf of a class of employees?

#### § § 83.7

        A petitioner or petitioners for a petition must be one or more, up to a maximum of three, of the following:

        (a) One or more DOE, DOE contractor or subcontractor, or AWE employees, who would be included in the proposed class of employees, or their survivors; or

        (b) One or more labor organizations representing or formerly having represented DOE, DOE contractor or subcontractor, or AWE employees, who would be included in the proposed class of employees; or

        (c) One or more individuals or entities authorized in writing by one or more DOE, DOE contractor or subcontractor, or AWE employees, who would be included in the proposed class of employees, or their survivors.

        § 83.8   How is a petition submitted?

#### § § 83.8

        The petitioner(s) must send a petition in writing to NIOSH. A petition must provide identifying and contact information on the petitioner(s) and information to justify the petition, as specified under § 83.9. Detailed instructions for preparing and submitting a petition, including an optional petition form, are available from NIOSH through direct request (1-800-35-NIOSH) or on the Internet at

        § 83.9   What information must a petition include?

#### § § 83.9

        (a) All petitions must provide identifying and contact information on the petitioner(s). The information required to justify a petition differs, depending on the basis of the petition. If the petition is by a claimant in response to a finding by NIOSH that the dose reconstruction for the claimant cannot be completed, then the petition must provide only the justification specified under paragraph (b) of this section. All other petitions must provide only the information specified under paragraph (c) of this section. The informational requirements for petitions are also summarized in Table 1 at the end of this section.

        (b) The petition must notify NIOSH that the claimant is petitioning on the basis that NIOSH found, under 42 CFR 82.12, that the dose reconstruction for the claimant could not be completed due to insufficient records and information.

        (c) The petition must include the following:

        (1) A proposed class definition   specifying:

        (i) The DOE facility or AWE facility   at which the class worked;

        (ii) The location or locations at the facility covered by the petition (e.g., building, technical area);

        (iii) The job titles and/or job duties of the class members;

        (iv) The period of employment relevant to the petition;

        (v) Identification of any exposure incident that was unmonitored, unrecorded, or inadequately monitored or recorded, if such incident comprises the basis of the petition; and

        (2) A description of the petitioner's (petitioners”) basis for believing records and information available are inadequate to estimate the radiation doses incurred by members of the proposed class of employees with sufficient accuracy. This description must include one of the following elements:

        (i) Documentation or statements provided by affidavit indicating that radiation exposures and doses to members of the proposed class were not monitored, either through personal or area monitoring; or

        (ii) Documentation or statements provided by affidavit indicating that radiation monitoring records for members of the proposed class have been lost, falsified, or destroyed; or

        (iii) A report from a health physicist or other individual with expertise in dose reconstruction documenting the limitations of existing DOE or AWE records on radiation exposures at the facility, as relevant to the petition. This report should specify the basis for believing these documented limitations might prevent the completion of dose reconstructions for members of the class under 42 CFR part 82 and related NIOSH technical implementation guidelines; or

        (iv) A scientific or technical report, published or issued by a government agency of the Executive Branch of government or the General Accounting Office, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, or published in a peer-reviewed journal, that identifies dosimetry and related information that are unavailable (due to either a lack of monitoring or the destruction or loss of records) for estimating the radiation doses of employees covered by the petition.

        (3) If the petition is based on an exposure incident as described under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, the petitioner(s) might be required to provide evidence that the incident occurred, but only if NIOSH is unable to obtain records or confirmation of the occurrence of such an incident from sources independent of the petitioner(s). Such evidence would not be required at the time the petition is submitted and the petitioner(s) would be directly informed of the need for this supplemental information. In such cases, either of the following may qualify as evidence:

        (i) Medical evidence that one or more members of the class may have incurred a high level radiation dose from the incident, such as a depressed white blood cell count associated with radiation exposure or the application of chelation therapy; or

        (ii) NIOSH will consider evidence provided by affidavit from one or more employees who witnessed the incident. If the petitioner cannot provide such affidavits because such employees are deceased, prevented by reasons of poor health or impairment, or cannot be identified or located, then the requirement for evidence provided by affidavit can be met by providing such an affidavit from one or more individuals who did not witness the incident, provided the individual was directly informed by one or more employees who witnessed the incident.

        (4) The provision of any evidence under this section or other provisions of this part, including one or more affidavits, would not, in and of itself, be sufficient to confirm the facts presented by that evidence. NIOSH will consider the adequacy and credibility of any evidence provided.

        (5) If, under § 83.15(a), NIOSH has already issued a  notice scheduling a Board meeting to consider a petition concerning a class of employees, then any petitions for such a class of employees submitted following this notice must, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, present substantially new information that has not already been considered by NIOSH. For this purpose, NIOSH would find that information has been already considered by NIOSH if it were included in the petition(s) that were already considered by NIOSH or if it were addressed either in the report(s) by NIOSH evaluating such a petition or petitions under § 83.13(c) or in a proposed decision by NIOSH responding to such a petition or petitions under § 83.16(a).

        § 83.10   If a petition satisfies all relevant requirements under § 83.9, does this mean the class will be added to the Cohort?

#### § § 83.10

        Satisfying the informational requirements for a petition does not mean the class will be added to the Cohort. It means the petition will receive a full evaluation by NIOSH, the Board, and HHS, as described under §§ 83.13 through 83.16. The role of the petitioner(s) is to identify classes of employees that should be considered for addition to the Cohort.

        § 83.11   What happens to petitions that do not satisfy all relevant requirements under §§ 83.7 through 83.9?

#### § § 83.11

        (a) NIOSH will notify the petitioner(s) of any requirement that is not met by the petition, assist the petitioner(s) with guidance in developing relevant information, and provide 30 calendar days for the petitioner(s) to revise the petition accordingly.

        (b) After 30 calendar days from the date of notification under paragraph (a) of this section, NIOSH will notify any petitioner(s) whose petition remains unsatisfactory of the proposed finding of NIOSH that the petition fails to meet the specified requirements and the basis for this finding.

        (c) A petitioner may request in writing a review of a proposed finding within 30 calendar days of notification under paragraph (b) of this section. Petitioners must specify why the proposed finding should be reversed, based on the petition requirements and on the information that the petitioners had already submitted. The request may not include any new information or documentation that was not included in the completed petition. If the petitioner obtains new information within this 30-day period, the petitioner should provide it to NIOSH. NIOSH will consider this new information as a revision of the petition under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) Three HHS personnel, appointed by the Director of NIOSH, who were not involved in developing the proposed finding will complete reviews within 30 work days of the request for such a review. The Director of NIOSH will consider the results of the review and then make a final decision as to whether the petition satisfies the requirements for a petition.

        (e) Proposed findings established by NIOSH under paragraph (b) of this section will become final decisions in 31 calendar days if not reviewed under paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f) Based on new information, NIOSH may, at its discretion, reconsider a decision that a petition does not satisfy the requirements for a petition.

        (g) A petitioner whose petition has been found not to satisfy the requirements for a petition under either paragraph (d) or (e) of this section may submit to NIOSH a new petition for the identical class of employees at any time thereafter on the basis of new information not provided to NIOSH in the original petition. In such a case, the petitioner is required to fully re-address all the requirements of §§ 83.7-83.9 in the petition.

> [70 FR 75952, Dec. 22, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 37459, July 10, 2007]

        § 83.12   How will NIOSH notify petitioners, the Board, and the public of petitions that have been selected for evaluation?

#### § § 83.12

        (a) NIOSH will notify the petitioner(s) in writing that it has selected the petition for evaluation. NIOSH will also provide the petitioner(s) with information on the steps of the evaluation and other processes required pursuant to these procedures.

        (b) NIOSH will combine separate petitions and evaluate them as a single petition if, at this or at any point in the evaluation process under §§ 83.13 and 83.14, NIOSH finds such petitions represent the same class of employees.

        (c) NIOSH will present petitions selected for evaluation to the Board with plans specific to evaluating each petition. Each evaluation plan will include the following elements:

        (1) An initial proposed definition for the class being evaluated, subject to revision as warranted by the evaluation conducted under § 83.13 or § 83.14; and

        (2) A list of activities for evaluating the radiation exposure potential of the class and the adequacy of existing records and information needed to conduct dose reconstructions for all class members under 42 CFR part 82.

        (d) NIOSH may initiate work to evaluate a petition immediately, prior to presenting the petition and evaluation plan to the Board.

        (e) NIOSH will publish a notice in the  notifying the public of its decision to evaluate a petition.

        § 83.13   How will NIOSH evaluate petitions, other than petitions by claimants covered under § 83.14?

#### § § 83.13

        (a) NIOSH will collect information on the types and levels of radiation exposures that potential members of the class may have incurred, as specified under 42 CFR 83.14, from the following potential sources, as necessary:

        (1) The petition or petitions submitted on behalf of the class;

        (2) DOE and AWE facility records and information;

        (3) Potential members of the class and their survivors;

        (4) Labor organizations who represent or represented employees at the facility during the relevant period of employment;

        (5) Managers, radiation safety officials, and other witnesses present during the relevant period of employment at the DOE facility or AWE facility;

        (6) NIOSH records from epidemiological research on DOE populations and records from dose reconstructions conducted under 42 CFR part 82;

        (7) Records from research, dose reconstructions, medical screening programs, and other related activities conducted to evaluate the health and/or radiation exposures of DOE employees, DOE contractor or subcontractor employees, and/or AWE employees; and

        (8) Other sources.

        (b) The Director of OCAS may determine that records and/or information requested from DOE, an AWE, or another source to evaluate a petition is not, or will not be, available on a timely basis. Such a determination will be treated, for the purposes of the petition evaluation, as equivalent to a finding that the records and/or information requested are not available.

        (1) Before the Director of OCAS makes such a determination, the source(s) potentially in possession of such records and/or information will be allowed a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the Director of OCAS, to provide the records and/or information.

        (2) Such a determination may take into account the types and quantity of records and/or information requested from the source, as well as any other factors that might be relevant to the judgment under paragraph (b)(1) of this this section of the amount of time that is reasonable to provide the records and/or information, which would be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Director of OCAS.

        (c) NIOSH will evaluate records and information collected to make the following determinations:

        (1)  (i) Radiation doses can be estimated with sufficient accuracy if NIOSH has established that it has access to sufficient information to estimate the maximum radiation dose, for every type of cancer for which radiation doses are reconstructed, that could have been incurred in plausible circumstances by any member of the class, or if NIOSH has established that it has access to sufficient information to estimate the radiation doses of members of the class more precisely than an estimate of the maximum radiation dose. NIOSH must also determine that it has information regarding monitoring, source, source term, or process from the site where the employees worked to serve as the basis for a dose reconstruction. This basis requirement does not limit NIOSH to using only or primarily information from the site where the employee worked, but a dose reconstruction must, as a starting point, be based on some information from the site where the employee worked.

        (ii) In many circumstances, to establish a positive finding under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section would require, at a minimum, that NIOSH have access to reliable information on the identity or set of possible identities and maximum quantity of each radionuclide (the radioactive source material) to which members of the class were potentially exposed without adequate protection. Alternatively, if members of the class were potentially exposed without adequate protection to unmonitored radiation from radiation generating equipment (e.g., particle accelerator, industrial x-ray equipment), in many circumstances, NIOSH would require relevant equipment design and performance specifications or information on maximum emissions.

        (iii) In many circumstances, to establish a positive finding under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section would also require information describing the process through which the radiation exposures of concern may have occurred and the physical environment in which the exposures may have occurred.

        (iv) In many circumstances, access to personal dosimetry data and area monitoring data is not necessary to estimate the maximum radiation doses that could have been incurred by any member of the class, although radiation doses can be estimated more precisely with such data.

        (2)  NIOSH will define the following characteristics of a class, taking into account the class definition proposed by the petition and modified as necessary to reflect the results of the evaluation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

        (i) Any of the following employment parameters, as necessary to identify members included in the class: facility, job titles, duties, and/or specific work locations at the facility, the relevant time period, and any additional identifying characteristics of employment; and

        (ii) If applicable, the identification of an exposure incident, when unmonitored radiation exposure during such an incident comprises the basis of the petition or the class definition.

        (3)  If it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy radiation doses for members of the class, as provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then NIOSH must determine, as required by the statute, that  (42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)(2)).

        (i) For classes of employees that may have been exposed to radiation during discrete incidents likely to have involved exceptionally high level exposures, such as nuclear criticality incidents or other events involving similarly high levels of exposures resulting from the failure of radiation protection controls, NIOSH will assume for the purposes of this section that any duration of unprotected exposure could cause a specified cancer, and hence may have endangered the health of members of the class. Presence with potential exposure during the discrete incident, rather than a quantified duration of potential exposure, will satisfy the health endangerment criterion.

        (ii) For health endangerment not established on the basis of a discrete incident, as described under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, NIOSH will specify a minimum duration of employment to satisfy the health endangerment criterion as having been employed for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days within the parameters established for the class or in combination with work days within the parameters established for one or more other classes of employees in the Cohort.

        (d) NIOSH will submit a report of its evaluation findings to the Board and to the petitioner(s). The report will include the following elements:

        (1) An identification of the relevant petitions;

        (2) A proposed definition of the class or classes of employees to which the evaluation applies, and a summary of the basis for this definition, including, as necessary:

        (i) Any justification that may be needed for the inclusion of groups of employees who were not specified in the original petition(s);

        (ii) The identification of any groups of employees who were identified in the original petition(s) who should constitute a separate class of employees; or

        (iii) The merging of multiple petitions that represent a single class of employees;

        (3) The proposed class definition will address the following employment parameters:

        (i) The DOE facility or the AWE facility that employed the class;

        (ii) The job titles and/or job duties and/or work locations of class members;

        (iii) The period of employment within which a class member must have been employed at the facility under the job titles and/or performing the job duties and/or working in the locations specified in this class definition;

        (iv) If applicable, identification of an exposure incident, when potential radiation exposure during such an incident comprises the basis of the class definition;

        (v) If necessary, any other parameters that serve to define the membership of the class; and

        (vi) For a class for which it is not feasible to estimate radiation doses with sufficient accuracy, a minimum duration of employment within the parameters of the class for inclusion in the class, as defined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;

        (4) A summary of the findings concerning the adequacy of existing records and information for reconstructing doses for individual members of the class under the methods of 42 CFR part 82 specifying, for each class defined in the report, whether NIOSH finds that it is feasible to estimate the radiation doses of members of the class with sufficient accuracy, and a description of the evaluation methods and information upon which these findings are based; and

        (5) For a class for which it is not feasible to estimate radiation doses with sufficient accuracy, a summary of the basis for establishing the duration of employment requirement with respect to health endangerment.

        (e) The NIOSH report under paragraph (d) of this section shall be completed within 180 calendar days of the receipt of the petition by NIOSH. The procedure for computing this time period is specified in § 83.5(c). In addition, the computing of 180 calendar days shall not include any days during which the petitioner may be revising the petition to remedy deficiencies identified by NIOSH under § 83.11(a) or (b), nor shall it include any days during which the petitioner may request a review of a proposed finding under § 83.11(c) or during the conduct of such a review under § 83.11(d).

        § 83.14   How will NIOSH evaluate a petition by a claimant whose dose reconstruction NIOSH could not complete under 42 CFR part 82?

#### § § 83.14

        (a) NIOSH may establish two classes for evaluation, to permit the timely adjudication of the existing cancer claim:

        (1) A class of employees defined using the research and analyses already completed in attempting the dose reconstruction for the employee identified in the claimant's petition; and

        (2) A class of co-workers similar to the class defined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to be defined by NIOSH on the basis of further research and analyses, using the procedures under § 83.13.

        (b) NIOSH will determine the health endangerment criteria for adding the class under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the Cohort, using the procedures under § 83.13. NIOSH will report to the Board and to petitioner(s) the results of this determination, together with its finding under 42 CFR part 82 that there was insufficient information to complete the dose reconstruction. HHS will consider this finding under 42 CFR part 82 sufficient, without further consideration, to determine that it is not feasible to estimate the levels of radiation doses of individual members of the class with sufficient accuracy.

        (c) NIOSH will evaluate the petition as it may concern a class of co-workers, as described under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the procedures under § 83.13.

        § 83.15   How will the Board consider and advise the Secretary on a petition?

#### § § 83.15

        (a) NIOSH will publish a notice in the  providing notice of a Board meeting at which a petition will be considered, and summarizing the petition to be considered by the Board at the meeting and the findings of NIOSH from evaluating the petition.

        (b) The Board will consider the petition and the NIOSH evaluation report at the meeting, to which the petitioner(s) will be invited to present views and information on the petition and the NIOSH evaluation findings. In considering the petition, both NIOSH and the members of the Board will take all steps necessary to prevent the disclosure of information of a personal nature, concerning the petitioners or others, where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

        (c) In considering the petition, the Board may obtain and consider additional information not addressed in the petition or the initial NIOSH evaluation report.

        (d) NIOSH may decide to further evaluate a petition, upon the request of the Board. If NIOSH conducts further evaluation, it will report new findings to the Board and the petitioner(s).

        (e) Upon the completion of NIOSH evaluations and deliberations of the Board concerning a petition, the Board will develop and transmit to the Secretary a report containing its recommendations. The Board's report will include the following:

        (1) The identification and inclusion of the relevant petition(s);

        (2) The definition of the class of employees covered by the recommendation;

        (3) A recommendation as to whether or not the Secretary should designate the class as an addition to the Cohort;

        (4) The relevant criteria under § 83.13(c) and findings and information upon which the recommendation is based, including NIOSH evaluation reports, information provided by the petitioners, any other information considered by the Board, and the deliberations of the Board.

        § 83.16   How will the Secretary decide the outcome(s) of a petition?

#### § § 83.16

        (a) The Director of NIOSH will propose a decision to add or deny adding any class or classes of employees to the Cohort, including an iteration of the relevant criteria, as specified under § 83.13(c), and a summary of the information and findings on which the proposed decision is based. This proposed decision will take into consideration the evaluations of NIOSH and the report and recommendations of the Board, and may also take into consideration information presented or submitted to the Board and the deliberations of the Board. In the case of a petition that NIOSH has determined encompasses more than one class of employees, the Director of NIOSH will issue a separate proposed decision for each separate class of employees.

        (b) The Secretary will make the final decision to add or deny adding a class to the Cohort, including the definition of the class, after considering information and recommendations provided to the Secretary by the Director of NIOSH and the Board. HHS will transmit a report of the decision to the petitioner(s), including an iteration of the relevant criteria, as specified under § 83.13(c), and a summary of the information and findings on which the decision is based. HHS will also publish a notice summarizing the decision in the

        (c) If, under § 83.15(e), the Board recommends that the Secretary designate a class covered by the petition as an addition to the Cohort, and if, under paragraph (b) of § 83.16, the Secretary decides to deny adding the class, as defined by the Board, to the Cohort, then the Secretary will submit to Congress a determination that the statutory criteria specified under 42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)(1) and (2) have not been met for adding the class to the Cohort. The Secretary will submit this determination to Congress within 30 calendar days following receipt by the Secretary of the recommendation of the Board.

        § 83.17   How will the Secretary report a final decision to add a class of employees to the Cohort and any action of Congress concerning the effect of the final decision?

#### § § 83.17

        (a) If the Secretary designates a class of employees to be added to the Cohort, the Secretary will transmit to Congress a report providing the designation, the definition of the class of employees covered by the designation, and the criteria and findings upon which the designation was based.

        (b) If, under § 83.15(e), the Board recommends that the Secretary designate a class covered by the petition as an addition to the Cohort, and if, under paragraph (b) of § 83.16, the Secretary decides to add a class to the Cohort that is inclusive of the class as defined by the Board, then the Secretary will transmit to Congress the report specified in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days following receipt by the Secretary of the recommendation of the Board.

        (c) A designation of the Secretary will take effect 30 calendar days after the date on which the report of the Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section is submitted to Congress, or is deemed to have been submitted to Congress,   unless Congress takes an action that reverses or expedites the designation.

        (d) After either the expiration of the congressional review period or notification of final congressional action, whichever comes first, the Secretary will transmit to DOL and to the petitioner(s) a report providing the definition of the class and one of the following outcomes:

        (1) The addition of the class to the Cohort; or

        (2) The result of any action by Congress to reverse or expedite the decision of the Secretary to add the class to the Cohort.

        (e) The report specified under paragraph (d) of this section will be published on the Internet at  and in the

        § 83.18   How can petitioners obtain an administrative review of a final decision by the Secretary?

#### § § 83.18

        (a) HHS will allow petitioners to contest only a final decision to deny adding a class to the Cohort or a health endangerment determination under § 83.13(c)(3)(ii). Such challenges must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days and must include evidence that the final decision relies on a record of either substantial factual errors or substantial errors in the implementation of the procedures of this part. Challenges may not introduce new information or documentation concerning the petition or the NIOSH or Board evaluation(s) that was not submitted or presented by the petitioner(s) or others to NIOSH or to the Board prior to the Board's issuing its recommendations under § 83.15.

        (b) A panel of three HHS personnel, independent of NIOSH and appointed by the Secretary, will conduct an administrative review based on a challenge submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and provide recommendations of the panel to the Secretary concerning the merits of the challenge and the resolution of issues contested by the challenge. Reviews by the panel will consider, in addition to the views and information submitted by the petitioner(s) in the challenge, the NIOSH evaluation report(s), the report containing the recommendations of the Board issued under § 83.15, and recommendations of the Director of NIOSH to the Secretary. The reviews may also consider information presented or submitted to the Board and the deliberations of the Board prior to the issuance of the recommendations of the Board under § 83.15. The panel shall consider whether HHS substantially complied with the procedures of this part, the factual accuracy of the information supporting the final decision, and the principal findings and recommendations of NIOSH and those of the Board issued under § 83.15.

        (c) The Secretary will decide whether or not to revise a final decision contested by the petitioner(s) under this section after considering information and recommendations provided to the Secretary by the Director of NIOSH, the Board, and from the HHS administrative review conducted under paragraph (b) of this section. HHS will transmit a report of the decision to the petitioner(s).

        (d) If the Secretary decides under paragraph (c) of this section to change a designation under § 83.17(a) of this part or a determination under § 83.16(c) of this part, the Secretary will transmit to Congress a report providing such change to the designation or determination, including an iteration of the relevant criteria, as specified under § 83.13(c), and a summary of the information and findings on which the decision is based. HHS will also publish a notice summarizing the decision in the

        (e) A new designation of the Secretary under this section will take effect 30 calendar days after the date on which the report of the Secretary under paragraph (d) of this section is submitted to Congress, unless Congress takes an action that reverses or expedites the designation. Such new designations and related congressional actions will be further reported by the Secretary pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 83.17.

        § 83.19   How can the Secretary cancel or modify a final decision to add a class of employees to the Cohort?

#### § § 83.19

        (a) The Secretary can cancel a final decision to add a class to the Cohort, or can modify a final decision to reduce the scope of a class added by the Secretary, if HHS obtains records relevant to radiation exposures of members of the class that enable NIOSH to estimate the radiation doses incurred by individual members of the class through dose reconstructions conducted under the requirements of 42 CFR part 82.

        (b) Before canceling a final decision to add a class or modifying a final decision to reduce the scope of a class, the Secretary intends to follow evaluation procedures that are substantially similar to those described in this part for adding a class of employees to the Cohort. The procedures will include the following:

        (1) Publication of a notice in the  informing the public of the intent of the Secretary to review the final decision on the basis of new information and describing procedures for this review;

        (2) An analysis by NIOSH of the utility of the new information for conducting dose reconstructions under 42 CFR part 82; the analysis will be performed consistently with the requirements for analysis of a petition by NIOSH under §§ 83.13(c)(1) and (2), and 83.13(c)(2) and (3);

        (3) A recommendation by the Board to the Secretary as to whether or not the Secretary should cancel or modify his final decision that added the class to the Cohort, based upon a review by the Board of the NIOSH analysis under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and any other relevant information considered by the Board;

        (4) An opportunity for members of the class to contest a proposed decision to cancel or modify the prior final decision that added the class to the Cohort, including a reasonable and timely effort by the Secretary to notify members of the class of this opportunity; and

        (5) Publication in the  of a final decision to cancel or modify the prior final decision that added the class to the Cohort.

        § 84.146   Method of measuring the power and torque required to operate blowers.

#### § § 84.146

        As shown in Figure 1 of this section, the blower crank is replaced by a wooden drum, a (13 cm. (5 inches) in diameter is convenient). This drum is wound with about 12 m. (40 feet) of No. 2 picture cord, b. A weight, c, of sufficient mass to rotate the blower at the desired speed is suspended from this wire cord. A mark is made on the cord about 3 to 4.5 m. (10 to 15 feet) from the weight, c. Another mark is placed at a measured distance (6-9 m./20-30 feet is convenient) from the first. These are used to facilitate timing. To determine the torque or horsepower required to operate the blower, the drum is started in rotation manually at or slightly above the speed at which the power measurement is to be made. The blower is then permitted to assume constant speed, and then as the first mark on the wire leaves the drum, a stopwatch is started. The watch is stopped when the second mark leaves the drum. From these data the foot-pounds per minute and the torque may be calculated.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 20608, Apr. 14, 2002,  unless otherwise noted.

        § 84.170   Air-purifying particulate respirators; description.

#### § § 84.170

        (a)  (1) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators utilize the wearer's negative inhalation pressure to draw the ambient air through the air-purifying filter elements (filters) to remove particulates from the ambient air. They are designed for use as respiratory protection against atmospheres with particulate contaminants at concentrations that are not immediately dangerous to life or health and that contain adequate oxygen to support life.

        (2) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators are classified into three series, N-, R-, and P-series. The N-series filters are restricted to use in those workplaces free of oil aerosols. The R- and P-series filters are intended for removal of any particulate that includes oil-based liquid particulates.

        (3) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators are classified according to the efficiency level of the filter(s) as tested according to the requirements of this part.

        (i) N100, R100, and P100 filters must demonstrate a minimum efficiency level of 99.97 percent.

        (ii) N99, R99, and P99 filters must demonstrate a minimum efficiency level of 99 percent.

        (iii) N95, R95, and P95 filters must demonstrate a minimum efficiency level of 95 percent.

        (b)  (1) Powered air-purifying particulate respirators utilize a blower to move the ambient air through the air-purifying filter elements (filters) to remove particulate contaminants and deliver clean air to the respiratory inlet covering. They are designed for use as respiratory protection against atmospheres considered not immediately dangerous to life or health and that contain adequate oxygen to support life.

        (2) Powered air-purifying particulate respirators are classified into two classes, HE and PAPR100, and three series, HE, PAPR100-N, and PAPR100-P. The N-series filters are restricted to use in those workplaces free of oil aerosols. The P-series filters are intended for removal of any particulate that includes oil-based liquid particulates.

        (3) All three filter series, HE, PAPR100-N, and PAPR100-P, for powered air-purifying particulate respirators must demonstrate a minimum efficiency level of 99.97 percent.

      Subpart O—Closed-Circuit Escape Respirators

**Source:** Source: 77 FR 14193, Mar. 8, 2012, unless otherwise noted.

        § 84.300   Closed-circuit escape respirator; description.

#### § § 84.300

        The closed-circuit escape respirator (CCER), technically a subset of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs) which are otherwise covered under subpart H of this part, is used in certain industrial and other work settings in emergencies to enable users to escape from atmospheres that can be immediately dangerous to life and health. Known in the mining community as self-contained self-rescuers (SCSRs), and in other industries as emergency escape breathing devices (EEBDs) or apparatus (EEBAs), CCERs are relied upon primarily by underground coal miners, sailors in federal service, and railroad workers to escape dangerous atmospheres after a fire, explosion, or chemical release. CCERs are commonly worn on workers' belts or stored in close proximity to be accessible in an emergency. They are relatively small respirators, typically the size of a water canteen, that employ either compressed oxygen with a chemical system for removing exhaled carbon dioxide from the breathing circuit, or a chemical that both provides a source of oxygen and removes exhaled carbon dioxide. Users re-breathe their exhalations after the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels have been restored to suitable levels, which distinguishes these “closed-circuit” self-contained respirators from “open-circuit” self-contained respirators, which vent each exhalation.

        § 84.301   Applicability to new and previously approved CCERs.

#### § § 84.301

        (a) Any CCER approval issued after April 9, 2012 must comply with the technical requirements of subpart O.

        (b) The continued manufacturing, labeling, and sale of closed-circuit apparatus previously approved under subpart H is authorized for units required for use in underground coal mines pursuant to 30 CFR 75.1714-1.

        (c) Any manufacturer-requested modification to a device approved under the subpart H technical requirements must comply with the subpart H technical requirements and address an identified worker safety or health concern to be granted an extension of the NIOSH approval. Major modifications to the configuration that will result in a new approval must meet and be issued approvals under the requirements of this subpart O.

> [84 FR 16412, Apr. 19, 2019]

#### § § 84.302

        (a) Each CCER must include components and/or attributes appropriate to its design, as follows:

        (1) Eye protection: Each CCER must include safety goggles or an escape hood lens that protects against impact, fogging, and permeation by gas, vapor, and smoke, as specified under § 84.308(c);

        (2) Thermal exposure indicators: If the manufacturer specifies a maximum and/or minimum environmental temperature limit for storage of the CCER, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can determine whether the CCER has been exposed to temperatures that exceed the limit(s);

        (3) Chemical bed physical integrity indicators: If the CCER includes a chemical oxygen storage or chemical carbon dioxide scrubber that can be functionally damaged by impact, vibration, or any other environmental factor to which the CCER might be exposed, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect any damage or alteration of the chemical oxygen storage or chemical carbon dioxide scrubber that could diminish the NIOSH-certified performance of the CCER, as tested under this subpart;

        (4) Oxygen storage vessel: If the CCER includes an oxygen storage vessel, the vessel must be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 CFR part 107, “Hazardous Materials Program Procedures,” unless exempted under subpart B of 49 CFR part 107;

        (5) Tamper-resistant/tamper-evident casing: If the CCER is not designed for its casing to be opened prior to use for an actual escape (e.g., for maintenance, escape drills, or inspection of the components), the casing must include a component, an attribute, or other means to prevent a person from accidentally opening the casing and, upon such opening, to either prevent the casing from being closed or to clearly indicate to a potential user that the casing has been previously opened; and

        (6) Moisture damage indicators: If the CCER is not designed for its casing to be opened for inspection of its internal components, the casing must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect any ingress of water or water vapor that could diminish the NIOSH-certified performance, as tested under this subpart.

        (7) Oxygen starter indicators: If the oxygen starter is a critical component of the CCER design, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect observable damage, premature activation, or recognized potential defect of the starter.

        (b) Where an indicator is required, the indication of the occurrence of the monitored condition must be clear and unambiguous: It must not depend on a subjective interpretation of subtle, graduated, or other non-discrete changes to the indicator.

        (ii) Any other conditions, other than that specified under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, that should govern the removal from service of the CCER (including an indication given by the activation or operation of any required indicator showing the monitored condition has occurred); and

        (iii) Any procedures by which a user or others should inspect the CCER, perform any maintenance possible and necessary, and determine when the CCER should be removed from service.

        (i) Each individual CCER unit approval label shall identify the capacity rating and number of liters of oxygen as determined by the capacity testing, pursuant to § 84.304.

        § 84.303   General testing conditions and requirements.

#### § § 84.303

        (a) NIOSH will conduct capacity and performance tests on the CCER using a breathing and metabolic simulator to provide quantitative evaluations and human subjects on a treadmill to provide qualitative evaluations. Information on the design and operation of the simulator is available from the NIOSH Web site at  Technical specifications can be obtained from NIOSH by contacting the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) by mail: P.O. Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. Telephone: 412-386-4000 (this is not a toll-free number). Email:

        (b) Capacity, performance, and wearability tests will continuously monitor the stressors listed in Table 1. The stressors and their respective acceptable ranges will be measured at the interface between the CCER and the mouth by instruments capable of breath-by-breath measurement. Stressor measurements will be evaluated as 1-minute averages. The operating averages of each stressor will be calculated upon the completion of each test as the average of the 1-minute measurements of the stressor recorded during the test. The level of any excursion for a stressor occurring during a test will be defined by the 1-minute average value(s) of the excursion(s).

        (c) Capacity and performance tests will conclude when the stored breathing gas supply has been fully expended.

        (d) NIOSH will determine a CCER to have failed a capacity, performance, or wearability test if any of the following occurs:

        (1) A 1-minute average measurement of any stressor listed in Table 1 occurs outside the acceptable excursion range specified in Table 1; or an average stressor measurement calculated at the completion of a performance or capacity test exceeds the acceptable operating average range specified in Table 1; or

        (2) A human subject cannot complete the test for any reason related to the CCER, as determined by NIOSH.

        (e) Unless otherwise stated, tests required under this subpart will be conducted at the following ambient conditions:

        (1) Ambient temperatures of 23 °C ±3 °C; and

        (2) Atmospheric pressures of 735 mm Hg ±15 mm Hg.

        § 84.304   Capacity test requirements.

#### § § 84.304

        (a) NIOSH will conduct the capacity test on a total of 8 to 10 of the units submitted for approval, as follows:

        (1) Three units will be tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator in the condition in which they are received from the applicant;

        (2) Two units will be tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator after being subjected to the environmental treatments specified in § 84.307 of this subpart;

        (3) Two units will be tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator at the cold-temperature limit recommended by the manufacturer under § 84.302(h)(1), after the unit has been stored for a minimum of 24 hours at this limit; and

        (4) One unit, in the condition in which it is received from the applicant, will be tested by a human subject on a treadmill.

        (5) To approve a CCER for use in coal mines, two units will also be tested by a human subject under the specifications of §§ 84.99 and 84.100 that are applicable to man test 4.

        (b) The capacity test will begin upon the first inhalation from or exhalation into the unit.

        (c) Each unit will be tested at a constant work rate, depending on the capacity value specified by the manufacturer, according to the requirements specified in Table 2. All volumes are given at standard temperature (0 C) and pressure (760 mm Hg), dry, unless otherwise noted.

        (d) NIOSH will rate an approved CCER using the appropriate capacity rating, as specified in Table 2.

        (e) NIOSH will document the least value achieved by the seven units tested using the breathing and metabolic simulator. NIOSH will quantify this value of achieved capacity within an increment of 5 liters, rounding intermediate values to the nearest lower 5-liter increment.

        § 84.305   Performance test requirements.

#### § § 84.305

        (a) NIOSH will conduct the performance test on a total of six of the units submitted for approval, as follows:

        (1) Three units will be tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator in the condition in which they were received from the applicant; and

        (2) Two units will be tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator after being subjected to the environmental treatments specified in § 84.307; and

        (3) One unit will be tested, in the condition in which it was received from the applicant, by a human subject on a treadmill.

        (b) Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the performance test will apply a repeating cycle of work rates, according to the sequence and requirements specified in Table 3, until the oxygen supply of the unit is exhausted.

        (c) Testing of CCERs with less than 50 liters of capacity, as determined by the capacity testing under § 84.304, will require the submission of additional test units to fully apply the work-rate test sequence and requirements specified in Table 3. The testing of each individual unit will complete the cycle specified in Table 3 until the breathing supply of the initial test unit is exhausted. This initial test unit will then be replaced by a second unit, which will continue the test cycle, beginning at the work rate in the cycle at which the initial unit was exhausted, and completing the full period specified in Table 3 for that work rate before proceeding to the subsequent work rate, if any, specified in Table 3. Each initial testing unit will be replaced as many times as necessary to complete the cycle, not to exceed two replacement units per initial test unit.

        (d) The performance test will begin with two exhalations into the unit at the specified ventilation rate and then follow the manufacturer's instructions to determine the design's susceptibility to hypoxia upon initial donning.

#### § § 84.306

        (a) NIOSH will conduct the wearability test on a total of three of the units submitted for approval. Three human subjects (two males and one female), one subject per unit, will conduct the test. The three subjects will range in height and weight as follows: One subject of height ≥174 cm and weight ≥90 kg; one subject of either 163 cm ≤height <174 cm, regardless of weight, or 72 kg ≥weight <90 kg, regardless of height; and one subject of height <163 cm and weight <72 kg. All units tested must meet all conditions specified in this section to receive approval.

        (b) NIOSH will evaluate the ease and speed with which users can don the CCER, as follows:

        (1) Each test subject will be provided with manufacturer instructions, and must be able to don the CCER correctly, isolating the lungs within 30 seconds;   and

        (2) A CCER must not include any design, construction, or material characteristic that can be anticipated or demonstrated, under plausible conditions, to hinder the user in the correct and timely donning of the CCER.

        (c) NIOSH will continuously monitor CCER use by each test subject during the activities specified in Table 4 to evaluate the ability of the CCER to provide an adequate and uninterrupted breathing supply, including but not limited to the requirements of § 84.303(b), without harming or hindering a user. NIOSH will not approve a CCER if the use of any unit during these activities indicates any potential for the CCER to harm or hinder the user or to fail to provide an adequate and uninterrupted breathing supply to the user during reasonably anticipated conditions and activities of an escape.

        § 84.307   Environmental treatments.

#### § § 84.307

        (a) Four units submitted for approval will be tested for capacity and performance, pursuant to the requirements of §§ 84.303 through 84.305, after exposure to environmental treatments simulating extreme storage temperatures, shock, and vibration.

        (b) The units will be stored for 16 hours at a temperature of −45 °C and for 48 hours at a temperature of 71 °C. Units will be returned to room temperature between high and low temperature treatments. The maximum rate of change for thermal loading shall not exceed 3 °C per minute and constant temperatures shall be maintained within ±2 °C.

        (c) The units, in the casing in which they are deployed for individual use, will be subjected to physical shock according to the following procedure:

#### § § 85.8

      An employer shall, in request of the NIOSH officer, provide suitable space, if such space is reasonably available, to NIOSH to conduct private interviews with, and examinations of, employees. NIOSH officers shall consult with the employer as to the time and place of the medical examination and shall schedule such examinations so as to avoid undue disruption of the operations of the employer's establishment. NIOSH shall conduct, and assume the medical costs of, examinations conducted under this part.

      § 85.9   Representatives of employers and employees; employee requests.

#### § § 85.9

      (a) NIOSH officers shall be in charge of investigations. Where the request for a health hazard evaluation has been made by an authorized representative of employees, a representative of the employer and a representative authorized by his employees who is an employee of the employer shall be given an opportunity to accompany the NIOSH officer during the initial physical inspection of any workplace for the purpose of aiding the investigation by identifying the suspected hazard. The NIOSH officer may permit additional employer representatives and such additional representatives authorized by employees to accompany him where he determines that such additional representatives will further aid the investigation. However, if in the judgment of the NIOSH officer, good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third party who is not an employee of the employer is reasonably necessary to the conduct of an effective and thorough investigation of the workplace, such third party may accompany the NIOSH officer during the inspection:  That access by such persons to areas described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be in accordance with the requirements of such provision, and access to areas described in paragraph (e) of this section shall be with the consent of the employer. A different employer and employee representative may accompany the officer during each different phase of an inspection if this will not interfere with the conduct of the investigation.

      (b) NIOSH officers are authorized to resolve all disputes as to who is the representative authorized by the employer and employees for the purpose of this section. If there is no authorized representative of employees, or if the NIOSH officer is unable to determine with reasonable certainty who is such representative, he shall consult with a reasonable number of employees concerning matters directly related to the health hazard evaluation.

      (c) NIOSH officers are authorized to deny the right of accompaniment under this section to any person whose conduct interferes with a fair and orderly physical inspection.

      (d) With regard to information classified by an agency of the U.S. Government in the interest of national security, only persons authorized to have access to such information may accompany an officer in areas containing such information.

      (e) Upon request of an employer, any representative authorized under this § 85.9 by employees in any area containing trade secrets shall be an employee in that area or an employee authorized by the employer to enter that area.

      § 85.10   Imminent dangers.

#### § § 85.10

      Whenever, during the course of, or as a result of, an investigation under this part, the NIOSH officer believes that there is a reasonable basis for an allegation of an imminent danger, NIOSH will immediately advise the employer and those employees who appear to be in immediate danger of such allegation and will inform appropriate representatives of the Department of Labor or the State agency designated under section 18(b) of the OSH Act.

      § 85.11   Notification of determination to employers, affected employees and Department of Labor.

#### § § 85.11

      (a) Upon conclusion of an investigation, NIOSH will make a determination concerning the potentially toxic or hazardous effects of each substance or physical agent investigated as a result of the request for health hazard evaluation. At a minimum, the determination will: (1) Identify each substance or physical agent involved and describe, where appropriate, the concentrations or levels of the substance or physical agent found in the place of employment and the conditions of use, and (2) state whether each substance or physical agent has potentially toxic or hazardous effects in the concentrations or levels found, as well as the basis for the judgments.

      (b) Copies of the determination will be mailed to the employer and to the authorized representatives of employees.

      (c) Except as hereinafter provided, the employer shall post a copy of the determination for a period of 30 calendar days at or near the workplace(s) of affected employees. The employer shall take steps to insure that the posted determinations are not altered, defaced, or covered by other material during such period. The employer will not be required to post the determination if the employer requests that copies of the determination be mailed to affected employees and furnishes NIOSH with a list of the names and mailing addresses of the employees employed in the workplace(s) designated by the NIOSH Officer. In the latter event, NIOSH will mail such copies to affected employees at the mailing addresses provided by the employer.

      (d) For purposes of this section, the term “affected employees” means those employees determined by NIOSH to be exposed to the substance(s) or physical agent(s) which is the subject of the health hazard evaluation.

      (e) Copies of determinations made under the OSH Act will be forwarded to the Department of Labor and the appropriate State agency designated under section 18(b) of the OSH Act. Copies of determinations made under the FMSH Act will be forwarded to the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor; the Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior; and the State agency which, in the judgment of NIOSH, would benefit the most from the information. If NIOSH determines that any substance or physical agent has potentially toxic or hazardous effects at the concentrations or levels at which it is used or found in a place of employment, and the substance or physical agent is not covered by a safety or health standard established under section 6 of the OSH Act or section 101 of the FMSH Act, NIOSH will immediately submit the determination to the Secretary of Labor, together with all pertinent criteria.

      § 85a.5   Conduct of investigations of places of employment.

#### § § 85a.5

      (a)(1) Prior to beginning a site visit, NIOSH authorized representatives will present their credentials to the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, explain the nature, purpose and scope of the investigation and the records specified in § 85a.3 which they wish to review, abstract or duplicate.

      (2) In those instances where site visits are not necessary to the conduct of an investigation and the initial contact is made verbally, NIOSH authorized representatives will, at the request of the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, provide a written explanation of the nature, purpose and scope of the investigation and the records specified in § 85a.3 which they wish to review, abstract or duplicate.

      (b)(1) At the commencement of an investigation, the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment shall precisely identify that information which is trade secret and might be seen or obtained by the NIOSH authorized representatives during the investigation. If the NIOSH authorized representatives have no clear reason to question such identification, such information will not be disclosed by NIOSH in accordance with the provisions of section 15 of the OSH Act. Generally, NIOSH will not question trade secret designations; however, if NIOSH at any time does question such identification, not less than 15 days' notice to the employer, owner, operator or agent will be given of the intention to remove the trade secret designation from such information. The employer, owner, operator or agent may within that period submit a request to the Director, NIOSH, to reconsider this intention and may provide additional information in support of the trade secret designation. The Director, NIOSH, will notify the employer, owner, operator or agent in writing of the decision which will become effective no sooner than 15 days after the date of such notice.

      (2) In those instances where the NIOSH authorized representative is a person fulfilling a contract agreement with NIOSH or is serving as an expert or consultant to NIOSH pursuant to the Act, the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment may, after advising the NIOSH contractor or consultant in writing, elect to withhold information deemed to be a trade secret from such a NIOSH authorized representative or prohibit entry into the area of the place of employment where such entry will reveal trade secrets. In those instances, where the subject information is needed or access to the area of the place of employment is necessary, in the judgment of NIOSH, to fulfill the goals of the investigation, NIOSH regular employees will then obtain the information or enter the subject area of the place of employment.

      (c)(1) NIOSH authorized representatives will be in charge of site visits conducted pursuant to this part.

      (2) Where there is a request by the representative of the State agency and/or employees, who were notified pursuant to § 85a.4(a)(1) or § 85a.4(a)(2) to accompany the NIOSH authorized representatives during the site visit of the place of employment, the NIOSH authorized representatives will allow this request if they determine that this will aid the investigation; or where, in the judgment of the NIOSH authorized representatives, good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third party who is not an employee of the employer is reasonably necessary to the conduct of an effective and thorough site visit, they may permit such third party to accompany them during the site visit:  That access by such person(s) to areas described in § 85a.5(c)(4) shall be in accordance with the requirements of such provision and access to areas containing trade secrets shall be with the consent of the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment.

      (3) NIOSH authorized representatives are authorized to deny the right of accompaniment under this paragraph to any person whose conduct in their judgment interferes with a fair and orderly site visit. In all instances, a representative of the employer shall be permitted to accompany the NIOSH authorized representatives during the site visit of the place of employment.

      (4) With regard to information classified by an agency of the United States Government in the interest of national security, only persons authorized to have access to such information may accompany NIOSH authorized representatives in areas containing such information.

      (d)(1) NIOSH authorized representatives are authorized: To collect environmental samples and samples of substances; to measure environmental conditions and employee exposures (including measurement of employee exposure by the attachment of personal sampling devices to employees with their consent); to take or obtain photographs, video recordings related to the purpose of the investigation; to employ other reasonable investigative techniques, including medical examinations, anthropometric measurements and standardized and experimental functional tests of employees with the informed consent of such employees; to review, abstract, and duplicate such personnel records as are pertinent to mortality, morbidity, injury, safety, and other similar studies; and to question and interview privately any employer, owner, operator, agency, or employee from the place of employment. The employer, owner, operator, or agency shall have the opportunity to review photographs, and video recordings taken or obtained for the purpose of identifying those which contain or might reveal a trade secret.

      (2) Prior to the conduct of medical examinations, anthropometric measurements or functional tests of any employees, the NIOSH authorized representatives will obtain approval of the procedures to be utilized from the NIOSH Institutional Review Board and no employee examination, measurement or test will be undertaken without the informed consent of such employee.

      (e) NIOSH authorized representatives will comply with all safety and health rules and practices at the place of employment and all NIOSH, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations and policies during a site visit and will provide and use appropriate protective clothing and equipment. In situations requiring specialized or unique types of protective equipment, such equipment shall be furnished by the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment.

      (f) The conduct of site visits will be such as to preclude unreasonable disruption of the operations of the place of employment.

Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary.

        (e) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.

        (f) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make separate application annually at such times and in such form as the Secretary may direct.

      Any public or private agency or institution is eligible to apply for a grant under this part, except Federal agencies or institutions not specifically authorized by law to receive such a grant.

      § 87.4   For what purposes may grants be awarded?

#### § § 87.4

      (a) The Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes grants for research, experiments, and demonstrations relating to occupational safety and health, including studies of the psychological factors involved. This authority includes projects to develop innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.

      (b) The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act authorizes grants for research projects designed to:

      § 87.6   How will grant applications be evaluated and the grants awarded?

#### § § 87.6

      (a) The Secretary may award grants to those applicants whose approved projects will best promote the purposes of either the Occupational Safety and Health Act or the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act on the basis of an evaluation conducted by experts or consultants engaged for this purpose.

      (b) This evaluation will take into account the scientific merit and significance of the project, the competency of the proposed staff in relation to the type of research or demonstration involved, the feasibility of the project, the likelihood of its producing meaningful results, the proposed project period, the adequacy of the applicant's resources available for the project, the amount of grant funds necessary for completion, and for mining grant applications, the recommendations of the Mine Health Research Advisory Committee.

      (c) The Secretary may evaluate and approve two or more concurrent applications, each dealing with one or more specified aspects of the project, and make two or more concurrent grant awards for the project. This may be necessary when a project involves a number of different but related problems, activities, or disciplines which would require evaluation by different groups, or when support for a project could be more effectively administered by separate handling of various aspects of the project.

#### § § 87.7

      (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long the Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 3-5 years.

      (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for 1 year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

      (c) Neither the approval of any application, nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

      § 87.8   How may a grantee use grant funds?

#### § § 87.8

      (2) Not later than 90 calendar days after the receipt of a valid petition, the Administrator will take one of the following actions:

      (i) Request a recommendation of the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee;

      (ii) Publish in the  a proposed rule to add such health condition;

      (iii) Publish in the  the Administrator's decision not to publish a proposed rule and the basis for that decision; or

      (iv) Publish in the  a decision that insufficient evidence exists to take action under paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

      (3) The 90-day time period will not include any days during which the Administrator is consulting with the interested party to clarify the submission.

      (4) The Administrator may consider more than one petition simultaneously when the petitions propose the addition of the same health condition. Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee recommendations and  notices initiated by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may respond to more than one petition.

      (5) The Administrator will be required to consider a submission for a health condition previously reviewed by the Administrator and found not to qualify for addition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions as a valid new petition only if the submission presents a new medical basis ( a basis not previously reviewed) for the association between the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the condition to be added. A submission that provides no new medical basis and is received after the publication of a response in the  to a petition requesting the addition of the same health condition will not be considered a valid petition and will not be answered in a  notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(2), above. The interested party will be informed of the WTC Health Program's decision in writing.

      (b) The Administrator may propose to add a condition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions in § 88.15 of this part by publishing a proposed rule in the  and providing interested parties a period of 30 calendar days to submit written comments.

The Administrator will publish a proposed rule or a decision not to publish a proposed rule in the  no later than 90 calendar days after the date of transmission of the Advisory Committee recommendation.

      (2) Before issuing a final rule to add a health condition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions, the Administrator will provide for an independent peer review of the scientific and technical evidence that would be the basis for issuing such final rule.

      § 88.17   Physician's determination of WTC-related health conditions.

#### § § 88.17

      (a) A physician affiliated with either a CCE or NPN will promptly transmit to the WTC Health Program a determination that a member's exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition, including a mental health condition. The transmission will also include the basis for such determination. The physician's determination will be made based on an assessment of the following:

      (1) The individual's exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

      (2) The type of symptoms experienced by the individual and the temporal sequence of those symptoms.

      (b) For a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, the physician's determination must contain information establishing how the health condition has resulted from treatment of a previously certified WTC-related health condition or how it has resulted from progression of the certified WTC-related health condition.

      § 88.18   Certification.

#### § § 88.18

      (a)  The WTC Health Program will review each physician determination and render a decision regarding certification of the condition as a _WTC-related health condition._ The WTC Health Program will notify the WTC Health Program member of the decision and the reason for the decision in writing.

      (1) In the course of review, the WTC Health Program may seek a recommendation about certification from a physician panel with appropriate expertise for the condition.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (c)  If certification of a condition as a WTC-related health condition or a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition is denied, the WTC Health Program member may appeal the WTC Health Program's decision to deny certification, as provided under § 88.21.

      § 88.19   Decertification.

#### § § 88.19

      (1) The WTC Health Program finds that the member's exposure is inadequate or is otherwise not covered;

      (2) The WTC Health Program finds that the member's certified WTC-related health condition was certified in error or erroneously considered to have been aggravated, contributed to, or caused by exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, pursuant to § 88.17(a); or

      (3) The WTC Health Program finds that the member's health condition was erroneously determined to be medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, pursuant to § 88.17(b).

      (b) A WTC Health Program member will be notified in writing by the WTC Health Program of a decertification decision, provided an explanation, as appropriate, for the decision, and provided information on how to appeal the decision. A WTC Health Program member whose WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition is decertified may appeal the decertification decision in accordance with § 88.21 of this part.

      § 88.20   Authorization of treatment.

#### § § 88.20

      (a)  Medically necessary treatment of certified WTC-related health conditions and certified health conditions medically associated with WTC-related health conditions will be provided through the CCEs or the NPN as permitted under WTC Health Program treatment protocols and in accordance with all applicable WTC Health Program policies and procedures.

      (b)  All treatment provided under the WTC Health Program will adhere to a standard which is reasonable and appropriate; based on scientific evidence, professional standards of care, expert opinion or any other relevant information; and which has been included in the medical treatment protocols developed by the Data Centers, with input from the CCEs, and approved by the Administrator of the WTC Health Program.

      (c)  While certification of a condition is pending, authorization for treatment of a WTC-related health condition or a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition must be obtained from the WTC Health Program before treatment is provided, except for the provision of treatment for a medical emergency.

      (4) Any administrative actions taken by the WTC Health Program in response to the Administrator's final decision.

      § 88.22   Reimbursement for medical treatment and services.

#### § § 88.22

      (a)  Each claim for reimbursement for treatment will be reviewed by the WTC Health Program. Claims that cannot be validated by that process will be further assessed by the Administrator of the WTC Health Program.

      (b)  (1) The costs incurred by a CCE or NPN-affiliated provider for providing a WTC Health Program member an initial health evaluation, medical monitoring, and/or medically necessary treatment or services for a WTC-related health condition or a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition will be reimbursed according to the payment rates that apply to the provision of such treatment and services under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. 8101  20 CFR part 10.

      (i) The Administrator will reimburse a CCE or NPN-affiliated provider for treatment for which FECA rates have not been established pursuant to the applicable Medicare fee for service rate, as determined appropriate by the Administrator.

      (ii) The Administrator will reimburse a CCE or NPN-affiliated provider for treatment for which neither FECA nor Medicare fee for service rates have been established, at rates as determined appropriate by the Administrator.

      (2) If the treatment is determined not to be medically necessary or is inconsistent with WTC Health Program protocols, the Administrator will withhold reimbursement.

      (c)  Payment for costs of medically necessary outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals for a WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition will be reimbursed by the WTC Health Program under a contract with one or more pharmaceutical benefit management services.

      § 88.23   Appeal of reimbursement denial.

#### § § 88.23

      After exhausting procedural and/or contractual administrative remedies, a CCE or NPN medical director or affiliated provider may submit a written appeal of a WTC Health Program decision to withhold reimbursement or payment for treatment found to be not medically necessary or not in accordance with approved WTC Health Program medical treatment protocols pursuant to § 88.20 of this part. Appeal procedures are published on the WTC Health Program Web site.

      § 88.24   Coordination of benefits and recoupment.

#### § § 88.24

      The WTC Health Program will attempt to recover the cost of payment for treatment, including pharmacy benefits, for a WTC Health Program member's certified WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition by coordinating benefits with any workers' compensation insurance available   for members' work-related health conditions, and with any public or private health insurance available   for members' non-work-related health conditions.

      (a) Where a WTC Health Program member's WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition is eligible for workers' compensation or another illness or injury benefit plan to which New York City is obligated to pay, the WTC Health Program is the primary payer.

      (b) Where a WTC Health Program member has filed a workers' compensation claim for a WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition and the claim is pending, the WTC Health Program is the primary payer; however, if the claim is ultimately accepted by the workers' compensation board, the workers' compensation insurer in question is responsible for reimbursing the WTC Health Program for any treatment provided and/or paid for during the pendency of the claim.

      (c) Where a WTC Health Program member has filed a workers' compensation claim for a WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, but a final decision is issued denying the compensation for the claim, the WTC Health Program is the primary payer.

      (d) Where a WTC Health Program member has filed a workers' compensation claim for a WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition with a workers' compensation plan to which New York City is not obligated to pay, the workers' compensation insurer is the primary payer. The WTC Health Program is the secondary payer.

      (1) If a WTC Health Program member settles a workers' compensation claim by entering into a settlement agreement that releases the employer or insurance carrier from paying for future medical care, the settlement must protect the interests of the WTC Health Program. This may include setting aside adequate funds to pay for future medical expenses, as required by the WTC Health Program, which would otherwise have been paid by workers' compensation. In such situations, the WTC Health Program may require reimbursement for treatment services of a WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition directly from the member.

      (2) The WTC Health Program will pay providers for treatment in accordance with § 88.22(b); to the extent that the workers' compensation insurance pays for treatment at a lower rate, the WTC Health Program will recoup treatment costs at the workers' compensation insurance rate.

      (e) Where a WTC Health Program member's WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition is not work-related, the WTC Health Program member's public or private health insurance plan is the primary payer. The WTC Health Program will pay costs not reimbursed by the public or private health insurance plan due to the application of deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, other cost sharing arrangements, or payment caps up to and in accordance with the rates described in § 88.22(b).

      (f) Any coordination of benefits or recoupment situation not described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will be handled pursuant to WTC Health Program policies and procedures, as found on the WTC Health Program Web site.

      § 88.25   Reopening of WTC Health Program final decisions.

#### § § 88.25

      At any time, and without regard to whether new evidence or information is provided or obtained, the Administrator of the WTC Health Program may reopen any final decision made by the WTC Health Program pursuant to the provisions of this part. The Administrator may affirm, vacate, or modify such decision, or take any other action he or she deems appropriate.

        § 93.100   General policy.

#### § § 93.100

        (a) Research misconduct involving Public Health Service (PHS) support is contrary to the interests of the PHS and the Federal Government, to the health and safety of the public, to the integrity of research, and to the conservation of public funds.

        (b) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and institutions that apply for or receive PHS support for biomedical or behavioral research, biomedical or behavioral research training, or activities related to that research or research training share responsibility for the integrity of the research process. HHS has ultimate oversight authority for PHS-supported research, and for taking other actions as appropriate or necessary, including the right to assess allegations and to perform inquiries or investigations at any time. Institutions and institutional members have an affirmative duty to protect PHS funds from misuse by ensuring the integrity of all PHS-supported work, and primary responsibility for responding to and reporting allegations of research misconduct, as provided in this part.

        § 93.101   Purpose.

#### § § 93.101

        The purpose of this part is to—

        (a) Establish the responsibilities of HHS, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), and institutions in addressing allegations of research misconduct;

        (b) Define what constitutes research misconduct in PHS-supported research;

        (c) Establish the requirements for a finding of research misconduct;

        (d) Define the general types of administrative actions HHS may take in response to research misconduct;

        (e) Require institutions to:

        (1) Develop and implement policies and procedures for reporting and addressing allegations of research misconduct covered by this part;

        (2) Provide HHS with the assurances necessary to permit institutions to participate in PHS-supported research;

        (f) Protect the health and safety of the public, promote the integrity of PHS-supported research and the research process, and conserve public funds.

        § 93.102   Applicability.

#### § § 93.102

        (a) Every extramural or intramural institution that applies for or receives PHS support for biomedical or behavioral research, biomedical or behavioral research training, or activities related to that research or research training must comply with this part.

        (b) This part applies to allegations of research misconduct involving:

        (1) Applications or proposals for PHS support for biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research, biomedical or behavioral research training, or activities related to that research or research training;

        (2) PHS-supported biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research;

        (3) PHS-supported biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research training programs;

        (4) PHS-supported extramural or intramural activities that are related to biomedical or behavioral research or research training, such as, but not limited to, the operation of tissue and data banks or the dissemination of research information;

        (5) Research records produced during PHS-supported research, research training, or activities related to that research or research training; and

        (6) Research proposed, performed, reviewed, or reported, as well as any research record generated from that research, regardless of whether an application or proposal for PHS funds resulted in an awarded grant, contract, cooperative agreement, subaward, or other form of PHS support.

        (c) This part does not supersede or establish an alternative to any applicable statutes, regulations, policies, or procedures for handling fiscal improprieties, the ethical treatment of human or animal subjects, criminal matters, personnel actions against Federal employees, or addressing whistleblowers and/or retaliation.

        (d) This part does not supersede or establish an alternative to the HHS suspension and debarment regulations set forth at 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by HHS at 2 CFR part 376; and 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, as supplemented by HHS at 48 CFR part 309, subpart 309.4. The Suspension and Debarment Official SDO and ORI may coordinate actions to the extent consistent with the SDO's and ORI's respective authorities. Such coordination includes jointly issuing notices or seeking settlements of actions and proceedings.

        (e) This part does not prohibit or otherwise limit how institutions handle allegations of misconduct that do not fall within this part's definition of research misconduct or that do not involve PHS support.

        § 93.103   Requirements for findings of research misconduct.

#### § § 93.103

        A finding of research misconduct made under this part requires that:

        (a) There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; and

        (b) The misconduct be committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; and

        (c) The allegation be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

        § 93.104   Time limitations.

#### § § 93.104

        (a)  This part applies only to research misconduct occurring within six years of the date HHS or an institution receives an allegation of research misconduct.

        (b)  Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply in the following instances:

        (1)  The respondent continues or renews any incident of alleged research misconduct that occurred before the six-year limitation through the use of, republication of, or citation to the portion(s) of the research record ( processed data, journal articles, funding proposals, data repositories) alleged to have been fabricated, falsified, or plagiarized, for the potential benefit of the respondent.

        (i) When the respondent uses, republishes, or cites to the portion(s) of the research record that is alleged to have been fabricated, falsified, or plagiarized, in submitted or published manuscripts, submitted PHS grant applications, progress reports submitted to PHS funding components, posters, presentations, or other research records within six years of when the allegations were received by HHS or an institution, this exception applies.

        (ii) For research misconduct that appears subject to the subsequent use exception, institutions must document their determination that the subsequent use exception does not apply. Such documentation must be retained in accordance with § 93.318.

        (2)  If ORI or the institution, following consultation with ORI, determines that the alleged research misconduct, if it occurred, would possibly have a substantial adverse effect on the health or safety of the public, this exception applies.

        § 93.105   Evidentiary standards.

#### § § 93.105

        (a)  An institutional or HHS finding of research misconduct must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

        (b)  (1) The institution or HHS has the burden of proof for making a finding of research misconduct. A respondent's destruction of research records documenting the questioned research is evidence of research misconduct where the institution or HHS establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent intentionally or knowingly destroyed records after being informed of the research misconduct allegations. A respondent's failure to provide research records documenting the questioned research is evidence of research misconduct where the respondent claims to possess the records but refuses to provide them upon request.

        (2) The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, all affirmative defenses raised. In determining whether HHS or the institution has carried the burden of proof imposed by this part, the finder of fact shall give due consideration to admissible, credible evidence of honest error or difference of opinion presented by the respondent.

        (3) The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any mitigating factors relevant to a decision to impose administrative actions after a research misconduct proceeding.

        § 93.106   Confidentiality.

#### § § 93.106

        (a) Disclosure of the identity of respondents, complainants, and witnesses while conducting the research misconduct proceedings is limited, to the extent possible, to those who need to know, as determined by the institution, consistent with a thorough, competent, objective, and fair research misconduct proceeding, and as allowed by law. Those who need to know may include institutional review boards, journals, editors, publishers, co-authors, and collaborating institutions. This limitation on disclosure of the identity of respondents, complainants, and witnesses no longer applies once an institution has made a final determination of research misconduct findings. The institution, however, must disclose the identity of respondents, complainants, or other relevant persons to ORI pursuant to an ORI review of research misconduct proceedings under this part.

        (b) Except as may otherwise be prescribed by applicable law, confidentiality must be maintained for any records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. Disclosure is limited to those who need to know to carry out a research misconduct proceeding.

        (c) This section does not prohibit institutions from managing published data or acknowledging that data may be unreliable.

        § 93.107   Coordination with other agencies.

#### § § 93.107

        (a) When more than one agency of the Federal Government has jurisdiction over a research misconduct allegation, HHS will cooperate with the other agencies in designating a lead agency to coordinate the response of the agencies to the allegation. Where HHS is not the lead agency, it may, in consultation with the lead agency, take appropriate action.

        (b) In research misconduct proceedings involving more than one agency, HHS may refer to the other agency's (or agencies') evidence or reports if HHS determines that the evidence or reports will assist in resolving HHS issues. In appropriate cases, HHS may seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.

          (a) ORI expects institutions to carry inquiries and investigations through to completion and to pursue diligently all significant issues and credible allegations of research misconduct. Institutions must notify ORI in advance if the institution plans to close a research misconduct proceeding at the assessment, inquiry, investigation, or appeal stage on the basis that the respondent has admitted to committing research misconduct or a settlement with the respondent has been reached.

          (b) A respondent's admission of research misconduct must be made in writing and signed by the respondent. An admission must specify the falsification, fabrication, and/or plagiarism that occurred and which research records were affected. The admission statement must meet all elements required for a research misconduct finding under § 93.103 and must be provided to ORI before the institution closes its research misconduct proceeding. The institution must also provide a statement to ORI describing how it determined that the scope of the misconduct was fully addressed by the admission and confirmed the respondent's culpability.

          (c) After consulting with the institution on its basis for closing a case under paragraph (a) of this section, ORI may conduct an oversight review of the institution's handling of the case and take appropriate action including:

          (1) Approving or conditionally approving closure of the case;

          (2) Directing the institution to complete its process;

          (3) Directing the institution to address deficiencies in the institutional record;

          (4) Referring the matter for further investigation by HHS; or

          (5) Taking a compliance action.

        Other Institutional Responsibilities

          § 93.318   Retention and custody of the institutional record and all sequestered evidence.

#### § § 93.318

          (a)  An institution must maintain the institutional record and all sequestered evidence including physical objects (regardless of whether the evidence is part of the institutional record) in a secure manner for seven years after completion of the proceeding or the completion of any HHS proceeding involving the research misconduct allegation under subparts D and E of this part, whichever is later, unless custody has been transferred to HHS under paragraph (b) of this section or ORI advises otherwise in writing.

          (b)  On request, institutions must transfer custody, or provide copies, to HHS of the institutional record or any component of the institutional record and any sequestered evidence (regardless of whether the evidence is included in the institutional record) for ORI to conduct its oversight review, develop the administrative record, or present the administrative record in any proceeding under subparts D and E of this part.

          § 93.319   Institutional standards of conduct.

#### § § 93.319

          Institutions may have standards of conduct different from the standards for research misconduct under this part. ORI findings of research misconduct or HHS settlements of research misconduct proceedings, or the absence thereof, do not affect institutional findings or actions taken based on an institution's standards of conduct.

          § 93.408   Mitigating and aggravating factors in HHS administrative actions.

#### § § 93.408

          The purpose of HHS administrative actions is remedial. The appropriate administrative action is commensurate with the seriousness of the misconduct and the need to protect the health and safety of the public, promote the integrity of the PHS-supported research and research process, and conserve public funds. ORI considers the following aggravating and mitigating factors in determining appropriate HHS administrative actions and their terms. The existence or nonexistence of any factor is not determinative.

          (a)  Were the respondent's actions knowing or intentional or were the actions reckless?

          (b)  Was the research misconduct an isolated event or part of a continuing or prior pattern of dishonest conduct?

          (c)  Did the misconduct have significant impact on the proposed or reported research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public health or welfare?

          (d)  Has the respondent accepted responsibility for the misconduct by:

          (1) Admitting the conduct;

          (2) Cooperating with the research misconduct proceedings;

          (3) Demonstrating remorse and awareness of the significance and seriousness of the research misconduct; and

          (4) Taking steps to correct or prevent the recurrence of the research misconduct?

          (e)  Does the respondent blame others rather than accepting responsibility for the actions?

          (f)  Did the respondent retaliate against complainants, witnesses, committee members, or other individuals?

          (g)  Does the respondent demonstrate responsible stewardship of research resources?

          (h)  Are other factors relevant to the circumstances of a particular case?

          § 93.409   Settlement of research misconduct proceedings.

#### § § 93.409

          (3) Every submission filed in the proceeding must be signed by and contain the address and telephone number of the party on whose behalf the document or paper was filed, or the attorney of record for the party.

          (c)  Service of a submission on other parties is accomplished by filing the submission with the ALJ through the DAB electronic filing system.

          § 93.509   Filing motions.

#### § § 93.509

          (a) Parties must file all motions and requests for an order or ruling with the ALJ, serve them on the other party, state the nature of the relief requested, provide the legal authority relied upon, and state the facts alleged in support of the motion or request.

          (b) All motions must be in writing.

          (c) Within 10 days after being served with a motion, or other time as set by the ALJ, a party may file a response to the motion. The moving party may not file a reply to the response unless allowed by the ALJ.

          (d) The ALJ may not grant a motion before the time for filing a response has expired, except with the parties' consent. However, the ALJ may overrule or deny any motion without awaiting a response.

          (e) The ALJ must make a reasonable effort to dispose of all motions promptly.

          § 93.510   Conferences.

#### § § 93.510

          (a) The ALJ must schedule an initial conference with the parties within 30 days of the DAB Chair's assignment of the case.

          (b) The ALJ may use the initial conference to discuss:

          (1) Identification and simplification of the issues, specification of genuine disputes of fact and their materiality to the ORI findings of research misconduct, and any proposed HHS administrative actions;

          (2) Identification of material legal issues and any need for briefing;

          (3) Scheduling dates for the filing of briefs based on the administrative record; and

          (4) Other matters that may encourage the fair, just, and prompt disposition of the proceedings.

          (c) The ALJ may schedule additional conferences as appropriate, upon reasonable notice to or request of the parties.

          (d) All conferences will be recorded with copies provided to the parties upon request.

          (e) Whenever possible, the ALJ shall memorialize in writing any oral rulings within 10 days after a conference is held.

          § 93.511   The Administrative Law Judge's ruling.

#### § § 93.511

          (a) Based on the administrative record, the ALJ shall issue a ruling in writing within 60 days after the last submission by the parties in the case, setting forth whether ORI's research misconduct findings and proposed HHS administrative actions reflected in the charge letter are reasonable and not based on a material error of law or fact. If the ALJ is unable to meet the 60-day deadline, the ALJ must set a new deadline and promptly notify the parties. The ALJ shall serve a copy of the ruling upon the parties and the ASH.

          (b) The ruling of the ALJ constitutes a recommended decision to the ASH. The ASH may review the ALJ's recommended decision and adopt, modify, or reject it (in whole or in part) as needed to ensure that the decision is reasonable and not based on a material error of law or fact. Within 30 days after service of the ALJ's recommended decision, the ASH shall notify the parties of the ASH's intent to review or not to review the ALJ's recommended decision. If the ASH does not provide notice of intent within the 30-day period or notifies the parties that the ASH does not intend to review the ALJ's recommended decision, the ALJ's recommended decision shall become final. An ALJ's recommended decision that becomes final in that manner or the ASH's decision after review constitutes the final HHS action on both ORI's findings of research misconduct and any HHS administrative actions.

    PART 100—VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION

### Part 100

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 312 and 313 of Public Law 99-660 (42 U.S.C. 300aa-1 note); 42 U.S.C. 300aa-10 to 300aa-34; 26 U.S.C. 4132(a); and sec. 13632(a)(3) of Public Law 103-66.

      § 100.1   Applicability.

#### § § 100.1

      This part applies to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) under subtitle 2 of title XXI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act.

> [60 FR 7693, Feb. 8, 1995]

      § 100.2   Average cost of a health insurance policy.

#### § § 100.2

      For purposes of determining the amount of compensation under the VICP, section 2115(a)(3)(B) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-15(a)(3)(B), provides that certain individuals are entitled to receive an amount reflecting lost earnings, less certain deductions. One of the deductions is the average cost of a health insurance policy, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary has determined that the average cost of a health insurance policy is $363.12 for 2006. This figure is calculated periodically (generally on an annual basis) using the most recent Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data available as the baseline for the average monthly cost of a health insurance policy. This baseline is adjusted by the annual percentage increase/decrease obtained from the most recent annual Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust (KFF/HRET) Employer Health Benefits survey or other authoritative source that may be more accurate or appropriate in the future. The revised amount will be effective upon its delivery by the Secretary to the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the amount will be published as a notice in the  periodically (generally on an annual basis).

      § 100.3   Vaccine injury table.

#### § § 100.3

      (a) In accordance with section 312(b) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, title III of Public Law 99-660, 100 Stat. 3779 (42 U.S.C. 300aa-1 note) and section 2114(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 300aa-14(c)), the following is a table of vaccines, the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths resulting from the administration of such vaccines, and the time period in which the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths is to occur after vaccine administration for purposes of receiving compensation under the Program. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth additional provisions that are not separately listed in this Table but that constitute part of it. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the qualifications and aids to interpretation for the terms used in the Table. Conditions and injuries that do not meet the terms of the qualifications and aids to interpretation are not within the Table. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth a glossary of terms used in paragraph (c).

      (b)  (1) Any acute complication or sequela, including death, of the illness, disability, injury, or condition listed in paragraph (a) of this section (and defined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section) qualifies as a Table injury under paragraph (a) except when the definition in paragraph (c) requires exclusion.

      (2) In determining whether or not an injury is a condition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Court shall consider the entire medical record.

      (3) An idiopathic condition that meets the definition of an illness, disability, injury, or condition set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be considered to be a condition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c)  The following qualifications and aids to interpretation shall apply to, define and describe the scope of, and be read in conjunction with paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section:

      (1)  Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, and potentially lethal systemic reaction that occurs as a single discrete event with simultaneous involvement of two or more organ systems. Most cases resolve without sequela. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and/or trachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. There are no specific pathological findings to confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

      (2)  A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy if an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy occurs within the applicable time period and results in a chronic encephalopathy, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (i)  (A) For children less than 18 months of age who present:

      () Without a seizure, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a significantly decreased level of consciousness that lasts at least 24 hours.

      () Following a seizure, an acute encephalopathy is demonstrated by a significantly decreased level of consciousness that lasts at least _2_4 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state—from a seizure or a medication.

      (B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute encephalopathy is one that persists at least 24 hours and is characterized by at least two of the following:

      () A significant change in mental status that is not medication related (such as a confusional state, delirium, or psychosis);

      () A significantly decreased level of consciousness which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and

      () A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.

      (C) The following clinical features in themselves do not demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of consciousness: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual screaming, poor feeding, persistent inconsolable crying, bulging fontanelle, or symptoms of dementia.

      (D) Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy and in the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of an acute encephalopathy.

      (ii)  Regardless of whether or not the specific cause of the underlying condition, systemic disease, or acute event (including an infectious organism) is known, an encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if it is shown that the encephalopathy was caused by:

      (A) An underlying condition or systemic disease shown to be unrelated to the vaccine (such as malignancy, structural lesion, psychiatric illness, dementia, genetic disorder, prenatal or perinatal central nervous system (CNS) injury); or

      (B) An acute event shown to be unrelated to the vaccine such as a head trauma, stroke, transient ischemic attack, complicated migraine, drug use (illicit or prescribed) or an infectious disease.

      (3)  A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered encephalitis if an injury meeting the description below of acute encephalitis occurs within the applicable time period and results in a chronic encephalopathy, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (i)  Encephalitis is indicated by evidence of neurologic dysfunction, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, plus evidence of an inflammatory process in the brain, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.

      (A) Evidence of neurologic dysfunction consists of either:

      () One of the following neurologic findings referable to the CNS: Focal cortical signs (such as aphasia, alexia, agraphia, cortical blindness); cranial nerve abnormalities; visual field defects; abnormal presence of primitive reflexes (such as Babinski's sign or sucking reflex); or cerebellar dysfunction (such as ataxia, dysmetria, or nystagmus); or

      () An acute encephalopathy as set forth in paragraph (c)(_2_)(i) of this section.

      (B) Evidence of an inflammatory process in the brain (central nervous system or CNS inflammation) must include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (>5 white blood cells (WBC)/mm  in children >2 months of age and adults; >15 WBC/mm3 in children <2 months of age); or at least two of the following:

      () Fever (temperature ≥ _1_00.4 degrees Fahrenheit);

      () Electroencephalogram findings consistent with encephalitis, such as diffuse or multifocal nonspecific background slowing and periodic discharges; or

      () Neuroimaging findings consistent with encephalitis, which include, but are not limited to brain/spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displaying diffuse or multifocal areas of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted image, or fluid-attenuation inversion recovery sequences.

      (ii)  Regardless of whether or not the specific cause of the underlying condition, systemic disease, or acute event (including an infectious organism) is known, encephalitis shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if it is shown that the encephalitis was caused by:

      (A) An underlying malignancy that led to a paraneoplastic encephalitis;

      (B) An infectious disease associated with encephalitis, including a bacterial, parasitic, fungal or viral illness (such as herpes viruses, adenovirus, enterovirus, West Nile Virus, or human immunodeficiency virus), which may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing; or

      (C) Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Although early ADEM may have laboratory and clinical characteristics similar to acute encephalitis, findings on MRI are distinct with ADEM displaying evidence of acute demyelination (scattered, focal, or multifocal areas of inflammation and demyelination within cerebral subcortical and deep cortical white matter; gray matter involvement may also be seen but is a minor component); or

      (D) Other conditions or abnormalities that would explain the vaccine recipient's symptoms.

      (4)  (i) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, intussusception means the invagination of a segment of intestine into the next segment of intestine, resulting in bowel obstruction, diminished arterial blood supply, and blockage of the venous blood flow. This is characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain that may be manifested by anguished crying, irritability, vomiting, abdominal swelling, and/or passing of stools mixed with blood and mucus.

      (ii) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following shall not be considered to be a Table intussusception:

      (A) Onset that occurs with or after the third dose of a vaccine containing rotavirus;

      (B) Onset within 14 days after an infectious disease associated with intussusception, including viral disease (such as those secondary to non-enteric or enteric adenovirus, or other enteric viruses such as Enterovirus), enteric bacteria (such as Campylobacter jejuni), or enteric parasites (such as Ascaris lumbricoides), which may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing;

      (C) Onset in a person with a preexisting condition identified as the lead point for intussusception such as intestinal masses and cystic structures (such as polyps, tumors, Meckel's diverticulum, lymphoma, or duplication cysts);

      (D) Onset in a person with abnormalities of the bowel, including congenital anatomic abnormalities, anatomic changes after abdominal surgery, and other anatomic bowel abnormalities caused by mucosal hemorrhage, trauma, or abnormal intestinal blood vessels (such as Henoch Scholein purpura, hematoma, or hemangioma); or

      (E) Onset in a person with underlying conditions or systemic diseases associated with intussusception (such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, or Kawasaki disease).

      (5)  Chronic arthritis is defined as persistent joint swelling with at least two additional manifestations of warmth, tenderness, pain with movement, or limited range of motion, lasting for at least 6 months.

      (i) Chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the 3 years prior to vaccination of arthropathy (joint disease) on the basis of:

      (A) Medical documentation recorded within 30 days after the onset of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between 7 and 42 days after a rubella vaccination; and

      (B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years after the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6 months following vaccination; and

      (C) Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus.

      (ii) The following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis/determatomyositis, fibromyalgia, necrotizing vasculitis and vasculopathies and Sjogren's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (whether by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders, and arthritis associated with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's Syndrome, blood disorders, or arthralgia (joint pain), or joint stiffness without swelling.

      (6)  This term is defined as dysfunction limited to the upper extremity nerve plexus ( its trunks, divisions, or cords). A deep, steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of the condition. The pain is typically followed in days or weeks by weakness in the affected upper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits, but is generally a less notable clinical feature. Atrophy of the affected muscles may occur. The neuritis, or plexopathy, may be present on the same side or on the side opposite the injection. It is sometimes bilateral, affecting both upper extremities. A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered brachial neuritis as a Table injury if such recipient manifests all of the following:

      (i) Pain in the affected arm and shoulder is a presenting symptom and occurs within the specified time-frame;

      (ii) Weakness;

      (A) Clinical diagnosis in the absence of nerve conduction and electromyographic studies requires weakness in muscles supplied by more than one peripheral nerve.

      (B) Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyographic (EMG) studies localizing the injury to the brachial plexus are required before the diagnosis can be made if weakness is limited to muscles supplied by a single peripheral nerve.

      (iii) Motor, sensory, and reflex findings on physical examination and the results of NCS and EMG studies, if performed, must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction is attributable to the brachial plexus; and

      (iv) No other condition or abnormality is present that would explain the vaccine recipient's symptoms.

      (7)  This term is defined by the presence of clinical manifestations, such as petechiae, significant bruising, or spontaneous bleeding, and by a serum platelet count less than 50,000/mm  with normal red and white blood cell indices. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with other causes such as hypersplenism, autoimmune disorders (including alloantibodies from previous transfusions) myelodysplasias, lymphoproliferative disorders, congenital thrombocytopenia or hemolytic uremic syndrome. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of immune (formerly called idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura that are mediated, for example, by viral or fungal infections, toxins or drugs. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections. Viral infections include, for example, those infections secondary to Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, human immunodeficiency virus, adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viral infection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing. However, if culture or serologic testing is performed, and the viral illness is attributed to the vaccine-strain measles virus, the presumption of causation will remain in effect. Bone marrow examination, if performed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal marrow.

      (8)  This term is defined as a measles illness that involves the skin and/or another organ (such as the brain or lungs). Measles virus must be isolated from the affected organ or histopathologic findings characteristic for the disease must be present. Measles viral strain determination may be performed by methods such as polymerase chain reaction test and vaccine-specific monoclonal antibody. If strain determination reveals wild-type measles virus or another, non-vaccine-strain virus, the disease shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. If strain determination is not done or if the strain cannot be identified, onset of illness in any organ must occur within 12 months after vaccination.

      (9)  This term is defined as a disease caused by poliovirus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should be determined to be the vaccine-strain by oligonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not sufficient to establish a tissue specific infection or disease caused by vaccine-strain poliovirus.

      (10)  SIRVA manifests as shoulder pain and limited range of motion occurring after the administration of a vaccine intended for intramuscular administration in the upper arm. These symptoms are thought to occur as a result of unintended injection of vaccine antigen or trauma from the needle into and around the underlying bursa of the shoulder resulting in an inflammatory reaction. SIRVA is caused by an injury to the musculoskeletal structures of the shoulder ( tendons, ligaments, bursae, etc.). SIRVA is not a neurological injury and abnormalities on neurological examination or nerve conduction studies (NCS) and/or electromyographic (EMG) studies would not support SIRVA as a diagnosis (even if the condition causing the neurological abnormality is not known). A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered SIRVA if such recipient manifests all of the following:

      (i) No history of pain, inflammation or dysfunction of the affected shoulder prior to intramuscular vaccine administration that would explain the alleged signs, symptoms, examination findings, and/or diagnostic studies occurring after vaccine injection;

      (ii) Pain occurs within the specified time-frame;

      (iii) Pain and reduced range of motion are limited to the shoulder in which the intramuscular vaccine was administered; and

      (iv) No other condition or abnormality is present that would explain the patient's symptoms ( NCS/EMG or clinical evidence of radiculopathy, brachial neuritis, mononeuropathies, or any other neuropathy).

      (11)  Disseminated varicella vaccine-strain viral disease is defined as a varicella illness that involves the skin beyond the dermatome in which the vaccination was given and/or disease caused by vaccine-strain varicella in another organ. For organs other than the skin, the disease must be demonstrated in the involved organ and not just through mildly abnormal laboratory values. If there is involvement of an organ beyond the skin, and no virus was identified in that organ, the involvement of all organs must occur as part of the same, discrete illness. If strain determination reveals wild-type varicella virus or another, non-vaccine-strain virus, the viral disease shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. If strain determination is not done or if the strain cannot be identified, onset of illness in any organ must occur 7- 42 days after vaccination.

      (12)  Varicella vaccine-strain viral reactivation disease is defined as the presence of the rash of herpes zoster with or without concurrent disease in an organ other than the skin. Zoster, or shingles, is a painful, unilateral, pruritic rash appearing in one or more sensory dermatomes. For organs other than the skin, the disease must be demonstrated in the involved organ and not just through mildly abnormal laboratory values. There must be laboratory confirmation that the vaccine-strain of the varicella virus is present in the skin or in any other involved organ, for example by oligonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction. If strain determination reveals wild-type varicella virus or another, non-vaccine-strain virus, the viral disease shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table.

      (13)  Vasovagal syncope (also sometimes called neurocardiogenic syncope) means loss of consciousness (fainting) and postural tone caused by a transient decrease in blood flow to the brain occurring after the administration of an injected vaccine. Vasovagal syncope is usually a benign condition but may result in falling and injury with significant sequela. Vasovagal syncope may be preceded by symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and/or pallor. Vasovagal syncope may be associated with transient seizure-like activity, but recovery of orientation and consciousness generally occurs simultaneously with vasovagal syncope. Loss of consciousness resulting from the following conditions will not be considered vasovagal syncope: organic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic attacks, hyperventilation, metabolic conditions, neurological conditions, and seizures. Episodes of recurrent syncope occurring after the applicable time period are not considered to be sequela of an episode of syncope meeting the Table requirements.

      (14)  Immunodeficient recipient is defined as an individual with an identified defect in the immunological system which impairs the body's ability to fight infections. The identified defect may be due to an inherited disorder (such as severe combined immunodeficiency resulting in absent T lymphocytes), or an acquired disorder (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from decreased CD4 cell counts). The identified defect must be demonstrated in the medical records, either preceding or postdating vaccination.

      (15)  (i) GBS is an acute monophasic peripheral neuropathy that encompasses a spectrum of four clinicopathological subtypes described below. For each subtype of GBS, the interval between the first appearance of symptoms and the nadir of weakness is between 12 hours and 28 days. This is followed in all subtypes by a clinical plateau with stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse. Death may occur without a clinical plateau. Treatment related fluctuations in all subtypes of GBS can occur within 9 weeks of GBS symptom onset and recurrence of symptoms after this time-frame would not be consistent with GBS.

      (ii) The most common subtype in North America and Europe, comprising more than 90 percent of cases, is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), which has the pathologic and electrodiagnostic features of focal demyelination of motor and sensory peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Another subtype called acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is generally seen in other parts of the world and is predominated by axonal damage that primarily affects motor nerves. AMAN lacks features of demyelination. Another less common subtype of GBS includes acute motor and sensory neuropathy (AMSAN), which is an axonal form of GBS that is similar to AMAN, but also affects the sensory nerves and roots. AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN are typically characterized by symmetric motor flaccid weakness, sensory abnormalities, and/or autonomic dysfunction caused by autoimmune damage to peripheral nerves and nerve roots. The diagnosis of AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN requires:

      (A) Bilateral flaccid limb weakness and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs;

      (B) A monophasic illness pattern;

      (C) An interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days;

      (D) Subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse; however, death may occur without a clinical plateau); and,

      (E) The absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis.

      (iii) Fisher Syndrome (FS), also known as Miller Fisher Syndrome, is a subtype of GBS characterized by ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia, and overlap between FS and AIDP may be seen with limb weakness. The diagnosis of FS requires:

      (A) Bilateral ophthalmoparesis;

      (B) Bilateral reduced or absent tendon reflexes;

      (C) Ataxia;

      (D) The absence of limb weakness (the presence of limb weakness suggests a diagnosis of AIDP, AMAN, or AMSAN);

      (E) A monophasic illness pattern;

      (F) An interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days;

      (G) Subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either

      stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse; however, death may occur without a clinical plateau);

      (H) No alteration in consciousness;

      (I) No corticospinal track signs; and

      (J) The absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis.

      (iv) Evidence that is supportive, but not required, of a diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS includes electrophysiologic findings consistent with GBS or an elevation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein with a total CSF white blood cell count below 50 cells per microliter. Both CSF and electrophysiologic studies are frequently normal in the first week of illness in otherwise typical cases of GBS.

      (v) To qualify as any subtype of GBS, there must not be a more likely alternative diagnosis for the weakness.

      (vi) Exclusionary criteria for the diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS include the ultimate diagnosis of any of the following conditions: chronic immune demyelinating polyradiculopathy (CIDP), carcinomatous meningitis, brain stem encephalitis (other than Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis), myelitis, spinal cord infarct, spinal cord compression, anterior horn cell diseases such as polio or West Nile virus infection, subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, cauda equina compression, metabolic conditions such as hypermagnesemia or hypophosphatemia, tick paralysis, heavy metal toxicity (such as arsenic, gold, or thallium), drug-induced neuropathy (such as vincristine, platinum compounds, or nitrofurantoin), porphyria, critical illness neuropathy, vasculitis, diphtheria, myasthenia gravis, organophosphate poisoning, botulism, critical illness myopathy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia.

    PART 110—COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM

### Part 110

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 247d-6e.

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 63675, Oct. 15, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 110.1   Purpose.

#### § § 110.1

        This part implements the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), which amended the Public Health Service Act (herein after “PHS Act” or “the Act”) by including section 319F-3, and section 319F-4 entitled “Covered Countermeasure Process.” Section 319F-4 of the PHS Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, following issuance of a declaration under section 319F-3(b), to establish procedures for the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (herein after “CICP” or “the Program”) to provide medical and lost employment income benefits to certain individuals who sustained a covered injury as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure consistent with a declaration issued pursuant to section 319F-3(b), or in the good faith belief that administration or use of the covered countermeasure was consistent with a declaration. Also, if the Secretary determines that an individual died as a direct result of a covered injury, the Act provides for certain survivors of that individual to receive death benefits.

        § 110.2   Summary of available benefits.

#### § § 110.2

        (a) The Act authorizes three forms of benefits to, or on behalf of, requesters determined to be eligible by the Secretary:

        (1) Payment or reimbursement for reasonable and necessary medical services and items to diagnose or treat a covered injury, or to diagnose, treat, or prevent its health complications, as described in § 110.31.

        (2) Lost employment income incurred as a result of a covered injury, as described in § 110.32.

        (3) Death benefits to certain survivors if the Secretary determines that the death of the injured countermeasure recipient was the direct result of a covered injury, as described in § 110.33.

        (b) In general, the benefits paid under the Program, are secondary to any obligation of any third-party payer to provide or pay for such benefits. The benefits available under the CICP usually will be paid only after the requester has in good faith attempted to obtain all other available coverage from all third-party payers with an obligation to pay for or provide such benefits ( medical insurance for medical services or items, workers' compensation program(s) for lost employment income). However, as provided in § 110.84, the Secretary has the discretion to pay benefits under this Program before a potential third-party payer makes a determination on the availability of similar benefits and has the right to later pursue a claim against any third-party payer with a legal or contractual obligation to pay for, or provide, such benefits.

        § 110.3   Definitions.

#### § § 110.3

        (3) If a covered countermeasure is administered to, or used by, a pregnant woman in accordance with paragraphs (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this definition, any child from that pregnancy who survives birth is an injured countermeasure recipient if the child is born with, or later sustains, a covered injury (as defined in section 110.3(g)) as the direct result of the covered countermeasure's administration to, or use by, the mother during her pregnancy.

        (o)  means legally incompetent to receive payment(s) of benefits, as determined under applicable law.

      Subpart B—Persons Eligible To Receive Benefits

        § 110.10   Eligible requesters.

#### § § 110.10

        (a) The following requesters may, as determined by the Secretary, be eligible to receive benefits from this Program:

        (1) Injured countermeasure recipients, as described in § 110.3(n);

        (2) Survivors, as described in § 110.3(cc) and § 110.11; or

        (3) Estates of deceased injured countermeasure recipients through individuals authorized to act on behalf of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's estate under applicable State law ( executors or administrators).

        (b) If a countermeasure recipient dies, his or her survivor(s) and/or the executor or administrator of his or her estate may file a new Request Package (or Request Package(s)) or amend a previously filed Request Package. A new Request Package may be filed whether or not a Request Package was previously submitted by, or on behalf of, the deceased injured countermeasure recipient, but must be filed within the filing deadlines described in § 110.42. Amendments to previously filed Request Packages and the filing deadlines for such amendments are described in § 110.46.

        (c) The benefits available to different categories of requesters are described in § 110.30.

        § 110.11   Survivors.

#### § § 110.11

        (a)  If the Secretary determines that an injured countermeasure recipient died as the direct result of a covered injury (or injuries), his or her survivor(s) may be eligible for death benefits.

        (b)  (1) The Act uses the same categories of survivors and order of priority for benefits as established and defined by the PSOB Program, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (4), and (5) of this section.

        (2) The PSOB Program's categories of survivors (known in the PSOB Program as beneficiaries) and order of priority for receipt of death benefits are detailed under subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796 ), as amended, as implemented in 28 CFR part 32.

        (3) In the PSOB Program, the person who is survived must have satisfied the eligibility requirements for a deceased public safety officer, whereas the person who is survived under this Program must be a deceased injured countermeasure recipient who would otherwise have been eligible under this part.

        (4) Unlike the PSOB Program, if there are no survivors eligible to receive death benefits under the PSOB Program (as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the legal guardian of a deceased minor who was a countermeasure recipient may be eligible as a survivor under this Program. Such legal guardianship must be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable State law.

        (5) A surviving dependent younger than the age of 18 whose legal guardian opts to receive a death benefit under the alternative calculation on the dependent's behalf will have the same priority as surviving eligible children under the PSOB Program (consistent with paragraph (b)(2) of this section) even if the dependent is not the surviving eligible child of the deceased countermeasure recipient for purposes of the PSOB Program. However, such a dependent may only be eligible to receive benefits under the alternative death benefits calculation, described in § 110.82(c), and is not eligible to receive death benefits under the standard calculation described in § 110.82(b). Death benefits paid under the alternative calculation will be paid to the dependents' legal guardian(s) on behalf of all such dependents.

        (6) Any change in the order of priority of survivors or of the eligible category of survivors under the PSOB Program shall apply to requesters seeking death benefits under this Program on the effective date of the change, even prior to any corresponding amendment to this part. Such changes will apply to Request Packages pending with the Program on the effective date of the change, as well as to Requests filed after that date.

      Subpart C—Covered Injuries

        § 110.20   How to establish a covered injury.

#### § § 110.20

        (a)  Only serious injuries, as described in § 110.3(z), _or_ deaths are covered under the Program. In order to be eligible for benefits under the Program, a requester must submit documentation showing that a covered injury, as described in § 110.3(g), was sustained as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure pursuant to the terms of a declaration under section 319F-3(b) of the PHS Act (including administration or use during the effective period of the declaration)  as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure in a good faith belief that it was administered or used pursuant to the terms of a declaration (including administration or use during the effective period of the declaration). A requester can establish that a covered injury was sustained by demonstrating to the Secretary that a Table injury occurred, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. In the alternative, a requester can establish that an injury was actually caused by a covered countermeasure, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Secretary may obtain the opinions of qualified medical experts in making determinations concerning covered injuries.

        (b)  A Table lists and explains injuries that, based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence, are presumed to be caused by a covered countermeasure, and the time periods in which the onset ( first sign or symptom) of these injuries must occur after administration or use of the covered countermeasures. If an injury occurred within the listed time periods, and at the level of severity required, there is a rebuttable presumption that the covered countermeasure was the cause of the injury. A Table is accompanied by Qualifications and Aids to Interpretation which provide an explanation of the injuries listed on a Table. A requester may establish that a covered injury occurred by demonstrating that the countermeasure recipient sustained an injury listed on a Table, within the time interval defined by the Table's Definitions and Requirements. In such circumstances, the requester need not demonstrate the cause of the injury because the Secretary will presume, only for purposes of making determinations under this Subpart, that the injury was the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. Even if the Table requirements are satisfied, however, an injury will not be considered a covered injury if the Secretary determines, based on her review of the evidence, that a source other than the countermeasure more likely caused the injury. In such circumstances, the Table presumption of causation will be rebutted.

        (c)  If an injury is not included on a Table or if the injury does not meet the requirements set out for an injury that is listed on a Table ( the first sign or symptom of the injury did not occur within the time interval specified on the Table), the requester must demonstrate that the injury occurred as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. Such proof must be based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence. Temporal association between receipt of the countermeasure and onset of the injury is not sufficient by itself to prove that the countermeasure caused the injury.

        (d)  An injury sustained as the direct result of the covered condition or disease for which the countermeasure was administered or used, and not as the direct result of the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, is not a covered injury ( if the covered countermeasure is ineffective in treating or preventing the underlying condition or disease).

      Subpart D—Available Benefits

        § 110.30   Benefits available to different categories of requesters under this Program.

#### § § 110.30

        (a)  A requester who is an injured countermeasure recipient may be eligible to receive either medical benefits or benefits for lost employment income, or both.

        (b)  A requester who is an eligible survivor of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient may be eligible to receive a death benefit if the death was caused by the covered injury or its health complications.

        (c)  The estate of an otherwise eligible deceased injured countermeasure recipient may be eligible to receive medical benefits or benefits for lost employment income, or both, if such benefits were accrued during the deceased countermeasure recipient's lifetime, or at the time of death, as a result of a covered injury or its health complications, but have not yet been paid in full by the Program. Such medical benefits and benefits for lost employment income may be available regardless of the cause of death. The estate of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient may not receive a death benefit. Death benefits are only available to certain survivors.

        § 110.31   Medical benefits.

#### § § 110.31

        (a) Injured countermeasure recipients may receive payments or reimbursements for medical services and items that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat a covered injury, or to diagnose, treat, or prevent the health complications of a covered injury. The Secretary may pay for such medical services and items in an effort to cure, counteract, or minimize the effects of any covered injury, or any health complication of a covered injury, or to give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of benefits to a requester ( a surgical procedure that lessens the amount of time and expense for the treatment of a covered injury). The Secretary may make such payments or reimbursements if reasonable and necessary medical services and items have already been provided or if they are likely to be needed in the future. In making determinations about which medical services and items are reasonable and necessary, the Secretary may consider whether those medical services and items were prescribed or recommended by a healthcare provider, and may consider whether the applicable service or item is within the standard of care for that condition.

        (b) To receive medical benefits for the health complications of a covered injury, a requester must demonstrate that the complications are the direct result of the covered injury. Examples of health complications include, but are not limited to, ill-effects that stem from the covered injury, an adverse reaction to a prescribed medication or as a result of a diagnostic test used in connection with a covered injury, or a complication of a surgical procedure used to treat a covered injury.

        (c) The calculation of medical benefits available under this Program is described in § 110.80. Although there are no caps on medical benefits, the Secretary may limit payments to the amounts that she determines are reasonable for services and items considered reasonable and necessary. All payment or reimbursement for medical services and items is secondary to any obligation of any third-party payer to pay for or provide such services or items to the requester. As provided in § 110.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover medical benefits paid by the Program to requesters if third-party payers are obligated to provide those benefits. Requesters are expected to make good faith efforts to pursue medical benefits and services from their primary payers. The Secretary reserves the right to disapprove medical benefits if the requester fails to do so.

        (d) The Secretary may make payments of medical benefits or reimbursements of medical expenses described in this section to the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient as long as such payments or expenses were accrued during the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's lifetime, or at the time of death, as the result of the covered injury or its health complications, and were not paid in full by the Program before the deceased injured countermeasure recipient died.

        § 110.32   Benefits for lost employment income.

#### § § 110.32

        (a) Requesters who are determined to be eligible for Program benefits as injured countermeasure recipients may be able to receive benefits for loss of employment income incurred as a result of a covered injury (or its health complications, as described in § 110.31(b)). Compensation for lost wages is paid as a percentage of the amount of employment income earned at the time of injury and lost as the result of the covered injury or its health complications. The period of time requested for lost employment income benefits must be supported by the severity of the covered injury as demonstrated by the medical and employment records.

        (b) The method and amount of benefits for lost employment income are described in § 110.81. Benefits for lost employment income will be adjusted if there are fewer than ten days of lost employment income. Pursuant to law, and as described in § 110.81, benefits provided for lost employment income may also be adjusted for annual and lifetime caps. Payment of benefits for lost employment income is secondary to any obligation of any third-party payer to pay for lost employment income or to provide disability or retirement benefits to the requester. It is the obligation of requesters to follow all specified procedures to apply for and acquire third-party benefits. The Secretary has the discretion to disapprove lost employment income benefits if the requester fails to do so. As provided in § 110.84, the Secretary reserves the right to recover lost employment income benefits paid by the Program to requesters if third-party payers are obligated to provide those benefits.

        (c) The Secretary does not require an individual to use paid leave ( sick leave or vacation leave) for lost work days. However, if an individual uses paid leave for lost work days, the Secretary will not consider those days to be days of lost employment income unless the individual reimburses the employer for the paid leave taken and the employer restores the leave that was used. This puts the individual back in the same position as if he or she had not used paid leave for the lost work days.

        (d) The Secretary may pay benefits for lost employment income to the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient as long as such benefits were accrued during the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's lifetime as the result of a covered injury or its health complications, and were not paid in full by the Program before the deceased injured countermeasure recipient died. However, no such lost employment income may be paid after the receipt, by the survivor or survivors of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient, of death benefits under § 110.82.

        § 110.33   Death benefits.

#### § § 110.33

        (a) Eligible survivors may be able to receive a death benefit under this Program if the Secretary determines that an otherwise eligible countermeasure recipient sustained a covered injury and died as a direct result of the injury or its health complications. The method and amount of death benefits are described in § 110.82. As provided in § 110.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover death benefits paid by the Program if third-party payers are obligated to provide those benefits. There are two different calculations for death benefits: the standard calculation and the alternative calculation.

        (b) The standard calculation, described in § 110.82(b), is based upon the death benefit available under the PSOB Program and is available to all eligible survivors with one exception (surviving dependents younger than the age of 18 who do not fit the definition of “child” under § 110.3(e)). In the event that death benefits were paid under the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient, no death benefits may be paid under the standard calculation. In addition, death benefits under this standard calculation are secondary to disability benefits under the PSOB Program. If a disability benefit was paid under the PSOB Program, the amount of that disability benefit would be deducted from benefits payable under the standard calculation.

        (c) The alternative calculation, described in § 110.82(c), is based on the injured countermeasure recipient's employment income at the time of the covered injury. Payment under this calculation is only available to surviving dependents who are younger than the age of 18 at the time of payment. The legal guardian(s) of such surviving dependents must select the death benefit as calculated under this alternative calculation before it will be paid. Annual and lifetime caps may apply. The payment of a death benefit as calculated under this alternative calculation is secondary to other benefits paid or payable with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient, namely:

        (1) Compensation for loss of employment income (except for lost employment income under this Program);

        (2) Death or disability benefits ( payments including, but not limited to, those under the PSOB Program) on behalf of the dependent(s) or their legal guardian(s);

        (3) Retirement benefits on behalf of the dependent(s) or their legal guardians; or

        (4) Life insurance benefits on behalf of the dependent(s).

      Subpart E—Procedures for Filing Request Packages

        § 110.40   How to obtain forms and instructions.

#### § § 110.40

        (a) Copies of all necessary forms and instructions will be available:

        (1) By writing to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 11C-26, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

        (2) By calling 1-888-ASK-HRSA. This is a toll-free number.

        (3) By downloading them from the Internet at  Click on the link to “Forms and Instructions.”

        (b) Before reviewing a Request for Benefits, the Secretary will assign a case number to the Request for Benefits and so inform the requester (or his or her representative) in writing. All correspondence to the requester (or his or her representative) about a specific Request for Benefits will be referenced by this case number.

        § 110.41   How to file a Request Package.

#### § § 110.41

        A Request Package comprises all the forms and documentation that are submitted to enable the Secretary to determine eligibility and calculate benefits. Request Packages may be submitted through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial carrier, or private courier service. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program will not accept Request Packages that are hand-delivered. Electronic submissions are not currently accepted, but may be in the future. The Program will publish a notice if electronic filing becomes available. Requesters (or their representatives) should send all forms and documentation to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 11C-26, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. All documentation to the Program must include the case number once one has been assigned to the requester.

        § 110.42   Deadlines for filing Request Forms.

#### § § 110.42

        (a)  All Request Forms (or Letters of Intent, described in paragraph (b) of this section) must be filed within one year of the date of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is alleged to have caused the injury. If no previous Request Form (or Letter of Intent) has been filed, this deadline also applies to survivor(s) of an injured countermeasure recipient who is deceased, and to the executor or administrator of his or her estate. If a Request Form (or Letter of Intent) was previously filed, § 110.46 describes amendments to Request Packages.

        (b)  Until Request Forms and Instructions are available, requesters must file a Letter of Intent to File, in order to establish that their Requests for Benefits are timely filed within the one-year deadline. Directions for submitting a Letter of Intent (to file) are available on the Program's Web site at  or by calling 1-888-ASK-HRSA. Even once Request Forms are available, the Secretary has the discretion to accept Letters of Intent (to file) for purposes of meeting the filing deadline. However, when Request Forms and Instructions are available, all requesters who have submitted Letters of Intent must still file Request Forms as soon as possible.

        (c)  The filing date is the date the Request Form (or Letter of Intent) is postmarked. A legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier, a private courier service, or the U.S. Postal Service will be considered equivalent to a postmark. If and when Request Forms are accepted electronically, the filing date is the date the Request Form is submitted electronically. A Request Form will not be considered filed unless it has been completed (to the fullest extent possible) and signed by the requester or his or her personal or legal representative. After filing a Request Form within the governing filing deadline, a requester must update the Request Package to reflect new information as it becomes available ( copies of medical records generated after the initial submission of the Request Package).

        (d)  If the Secretary determines that a Request Form or Letter of Intent was not filed within the governing filing deadline set out in this section, the Request Form (or Letter of Intent) will not be processed and the requester will not be eligible for benefits under this Program.

        (e)  The Secretary reserves the right to consider a legal claim filed with the Federal Government ( a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or a petition with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program) concerning an alleged injury resulting from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure to be a filing of a Request Form or Letter of Intent for purposes of determining the filing date under this Program. The date of such constructive filing will be the official filing date of the action,  when all applicable requirements for proper filing in that forum have been met.

        (f)  The Secretary may publish a new Table (or Tables) by amendment(s) to subpart K of this part. The effect of such a new Table or amendment may enable a requester who previously could not establish a Table injury to do so. In such circumstances, within one year after the effective date of the establishment of, or amendment to, the Table, the requester must file a new Request Form if one was previously submitted and eligibility was denied or if one was not previously submitted. If the Secretary has not made a determination, she will automatically review any pending Request Forms in light of the new or amended Table(s).

> [75 FR 63675, Oct. 15, 2010, as amended at 76 FR 62309, Oct. 7, 2011]

        § 110.43   Deadlines for submitting documentation.

#### § § 110.43

        (a)  A requester will satisfy the filing deadline as long as the signed Request Form is completed (to the fullest extent possible) and submitted within the governing filing deadline described in § 110.42. The Secretary generally will not begin review of a requester's eligibility until all the documentation necessary to make this determination has been submitted.

        (b)  Although the Secretary will accept documentation required to make benefits determinations ( calculate benefits available, if any) at the time the Request Form is filed or any time thereafter, requesters need not submit such documentation until they have been notified that the Secretary has determined eligibility. The Secretary will not generally begin review of the benefits available to a requester until the documentation necessary to make a benefits determination has been submitted.

        § 110.44   Legal or personal representatives of requesters.

#### § § 110.44

        (a)  Persons other than a requester ( a lawyer, guardian, family member, friend) may file a Request Package on a requester's behalf as his or her legal or personal representative. A requester need not use the services of a lawyer to apply for benefits under this Program. A legal representative, or a personal representative (who does not need to be a lawyer) is only required, as described in this section, for requesters who are minors or adults who lack legal capacity to receive payment of benefits. In the event that a legal or personal representative files on behalf of a requester, the representative will be bound by the obligations and documentation requirements that apply to the requester ( if a requester is required to submit employment records, the representative must file the requester's employment records). The representative must also satisfy the requirements specific to representatives set out in this part. If a requester has a representative, the Program will generally direct all communications to the representative. However, the Secretary reserves the right of the Program to contact the requester directly if necessary, and to conduct a follow-up survey to determine the ability of the Program to meet requesters' needs.

        (b)  A requester who is a legally competent adult  use a legal or personal representative to submit a Request Package on his or her behalf. In such circumstances, the requester must indicate on the Request Form that he or she is authorizing the representative to seek benefits under this Program on his or her behalf.

        (c)  A requester who is a minor or an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits  use a legal or personal representative to apply for benefits under this Program on his or her behalf. In such circumstances, the representative _must_ indicate, in the place provided on the Request Form, that the requester is a minor or an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits and that the representative is filing on behalf of the requester. In addition, before the requester will be paid by the Program, the representative must submit the documentation described in § 110.63. A minor who is emancipated, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, does not need a legal or personal representative to file a Request Form or Request Package on his or her behalf.

        (d)  The Act does not authorize the Secretary to pay for, or reimburse, any fees or costs associated with the requester's use of the services of a legal or personal representative under this Program, including those of an attorney.

        § 110.45   Multiple survivors.

#### § § 110.45

        Multiple survivors of the same deceased injured countermeasure recipient may file Request Forms separately or together. Multiple survivors may also submit one set of any required documentation on behalf of all of the requesting survivors as long as such documentation is identical for each survivor.

        § 110.46   Amending a Request Package.

#### § § 110.46

        (a)  All requesters may amend their documentation concerning _eligibility_ up to the time the Secretary has made an eligibility determination. Requesters are expected to submit additional medical records as they become available. Requesters also may amend their information or documentation concerning the calculation of _benefits_ until the Secretary has made a benefits determination. Once an  determination has been made, the Secretary will not accept additional documentation concerning eligibility, except as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Once a  determination has been made, the Secretary will not accept additional documentation regarding the type or amount of benefits for that covered injury, except as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  If an injured countermeasure recipient submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but subsequently dies, or the executor or administrator timely filed on behalf of the estate, the survivor(s) may amend the previously filed Request Package at any time by filing a new Request Form in order to be considered for death benefits. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's Request Package. However, a survivor filing an amendment to a previously filed Request Package may only be eligible for benefits if the previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing filing deadline. All documentation that has already been submitted with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient will be considered part of the survivor requester's Request Package, and he or she is not required to resubmit such documentation. Survivor requesters must also file an amendment to a Request Package if there is a change in the order of priority of survivors, as described in § 110.11.

        (c)  If an injured countermeasure recipient submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but subsequently dies before all due benefits are paid by the Program, the executor or administrator of his or her estate may amend his or her Request Package at any time in order for the estate to be considered for benefits. This opportunity to amend applies also if the Request Form was timely filed by a survivor. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's Request Package. However, the executor or administrator of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's estate filing an amendment to a previously filed Request Package may only be eligible to receive benefits on behalf of the estate if the previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing deadline. All documentation that has already been submitted with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient will be considered part of that person's Request Package, and the executor or administrator of the estate is not required to resubmit such documentation.

      Subpart F—Documentation Required for the Secretary To Determine Eligibility

        § 110.50   Medical records necessary for the Secretary to determine whether a covered injury was sustained.

#### § § 110.50

        (a) In order to determine whether an injured countermeasure recipient sustained a covered injury, a requester must arrange for his or her medical providers to submit to the Program the following medical records, as defined in § 110.3(p):

        (1) All medical records documenting medical visits, procedures, consultations, and test results that occurred on or after the date of administration or use of the covered countermeasure; and

        (2) All hospital records, including the admission history and physical examination, the discharge summary, all physician subspecialty consultation reports, all physician and nursing progress notes, and all test results that occurred on or after the date of administration or use of the covered countermeasure; and

        (3) All medical records for one year prior to administration or use of the covered countermeasure as necessary to indicate an injured countermeasure recipient's pre-existing medical history.

        (b) A requester may submit additional medical documentation that he or she believes will support the Request Package. Although generally not required if a Table injury was sustained, a requester may introduce additional medical documentation or scientific evidence in order to establish that an injury was caused by a covered countermeasure. Letters from treating physicians may be submitted as additional evidence, but may not substitute for the medical documentation required in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) If certain medical records listed in paragraph (a) of this section are unavailable to the Program after the requester has made reasonable efforts to facilitate the records being sent to the Program, the requester must submit a statement describing the reasons for the records' unavailability and the efforts he or she has made to arrange for the health care providers to submit them. The Secretary has the discretion to accept this statement in place of the unavailable medical records. In this circumstance, the Secretary may attempt to obtain the records on the requester's behalf.

        (d) In certain circumstances, the Secretary may require additional records to make a determination that a covered injury was sustained ( medical records more than one year prior to the date of administration or use of the covered countermeasure) or may determine that certain records described in paragraph (a) of this section are not necessary for an eligibility determination.

        (e) Although the Secretary prefers to receive medical records directly from healthcare providers, she has the discretion to accept them from the requester.

        § 110.51   Documentation an injured countermeasure recipient must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of eligibility for Program benefits.

#### § § 110.51

        (a) An injured countermeasure recipient (or his or her legal or personal representative) must submit all of the following documentation in order for the Secretary to make a determination of eligibility:

        (1) A completed and signed Request Form submitted within the filing deadline described in § 110.42; and

        (2) Records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient used or was administered a covered countermeasure; and

        (3) Records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient sustained a covered injury, as defined in § 110.3(g), in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 110.50; and

        (4) A copy of each signed Authorization for Health Information Form authorizing the release of records to the Program that was sent by the requester to each healthcare provider instructing that the records be submitted directly to the Program.

        (b) In certain circumstances, some of the above documentation may not be required, or additional documentation may be required, in which case the Secretary will so notify the requester. For example, the Secretary may require records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient was administered or used a covered countermeasure in accordance with the provisions of a Secretarial declaration, or in the good faith belief that it was so administered or used, if she is unable to determine this from the records submitted. In order to meet the specifications of a declaration, some individuals will need to show that the activity giving rise to the injury ( administration or use of the covered countermeasure) was authorized in accordance with the public health and medical response of the Authority Having Jurisdiction, as defined in the pertinent declaration, to prescribe, administer, deliver, distribute or dispense the covered countermeasure following a declaration of an emergency, as defined in the pertinent declaration. For purposes of this part, this requirement can be satisfied by showing that the covered countermeasure was administered or used following the declaration of an emergency, as defined in the pertinent declaration, by an Authority Having Jurisdiction, as defined in the pertinent declaration either:

        (1) Pursuant to a written agreement or other formal arrangement with an Authority Having Jurisdiction; or

        (2) In accordance with the written recommendations of an Authority Having Jurisdiction.

        § 110.52   Documentation a survivor must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of eligibility for death benefits.

#### § § 110.52

        (a) A requester who is a survivor under § 110.11 must submit the following documentation in order for a determination of eligibility for a death benefit to be made:

        (1) All of the documentation required for individuals in § 110.51. There is no need to duplicate documentation already submitted to satisfy the requirements of other subparts in this part. For example, if the deceased injured countermeasure recipient had previously filed, the documentation submitted does not have to be re-submitted; and

        (2) A death certificate for the deceased countermeasure recipient. If a death certificate is unavailable, the requester must submit a letter providing the reasons for its unavailability. The Secretary has the discretion to accept other documentation as evidence that the injured countermeasure recipient is deceased; and

        (3) Medical records sufficient to establish that the deceased injured countermeasure recipient died as the result of the covered injury or its health complications. Such medical records may be the same as those required under § 110.50. If an autopsy was performed, the requester must submit a complete copy of the final autopsy report; and

        (4) Documentation showing that the requester is an eligible survivor, pursuant to § 110.11 ( birth certificate or marriage certificate); and

        (5) Verification, on the place provided on the Request Form, either that there are no other eligible survivors ( for surviving eligible children, that there is no surviving spouse, no other surviving eligible children, and no other surviving dependents younger than the age of 18 who may be eligible for the death benefit under the alternative calculation) or that other eligible survivors exist (along with the information known about such survivors). Section 110.11 describes eligible survivors and the priorities of survivorship; and

        (6) Even if a Request Form had previously been filed by the injured countermeasure recipient, the survivor(s) must submit a new Request Form.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 110.53   Documentation the executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of eligibility for benefits to the estate.

#### § § 110.53

        (a) The executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient must submit the following documentation in order for a determination of eligibility for benefits to the estate to be made:

        (1) All of the documentation required for individuals in § 110.51;

        (2) A death certificate for the deceased injured countermeasure recipient. If a death certificate is unavailable, the executor or administrator must submit a letter providing the reasons for its unavailability. The Secretary has the discretion to accept other documentation as evidence that the injured countermeasure recipient is deceased; and

        (3) Documentation showing that the individual is the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient,  Letter of Administration issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; and

        (4) Even if a Request Form had previously been filed by the injured countermeasure recipient, the executor or administrator of the estate must submit a new Request Form.

        (b) [Reserved]

      Subpart G—Documentation Required for the Secretary To Determine Program Benefits

        § 110.60   Documentation a requester who is determined to be eligible must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of medical benefits.

#### § § 110.60

        (a) A requester determined by the Secretary to be eligible for Program benefits and who seeks payment or reimbursement for medical services or items must provide the following, in addition to the documentation submitted under subpart F of this part:

        (1)  The requester must submit a list of all third-party payers that may have an obligation to pay for or provide any medical services or items to the injured countermeasure recipient for which payment or reimbursement is being sought under this Program. Such third-party payers may include, but are not limited to, health maintenance organizations, health insurance companies, workers' compensation programs, Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, military treatment facilities (MTFs), and any other entities obligated to provide medical services or items or reimburse individuals for medical expenses. Such a list must include the injured countermeasure recipient's account numbers and other applicable information. If the requester knows of no such third-party payer, he or she must so certify in writing. If the requester becomes aware that a third-party payer may have such an obligation, the requester must inform the Secretary within ten business days of becoming aware of this information, even after benefits have been paid by the Program.

        (2)  A requester seeking payment or reimbursement for medical services or items already provided for a covered injury or its health complications must submit an itemized statement from each healthcare provider or entity ( clinic, hospital, doctor, or pharmacy) and third-party payer listing the services or items provided to diagnose or treat the covered injury or its health complications and the amounts paid or expected to be paid by third parties for such services or items ( an Explanation of Benefits from the individual's health insurance company). If no third-party payer has an obligation to pay for or provide such services or items, the requester must so certify in writing and submit an itemized list of the services or items provided (including the total cost of such services or items). To assist the Secretary in making a determination as to whether such services or items were reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat a covered injury, or to diagnose, treat, or prevent its health complications, the requester may submit, in addition to the required medical records, documentation showing that a health-care provider prescribed or recommended such services or items. The medical records must support the requested services and items.

        (3)  A requester seeking payments for medical services or items resulting from a covered injury or its health complications expected to be provided in the future must submit a statement from each healthcare provider ( a treating neurologist for neurological issues and a treating cardiologist for cardiac issues) describing those services and items that appear likely to be needed to diagnose or treat the covered injury, or to diagnose, treat, or prevent its health complications, in the future. The medical records must support the requested services and items. A requester must submit documentation, if available, concerning the likely cost of, and the amount expected to be covered by third-party payers for, such services or items. Consent for the Program to communicate directly with the healthcare providers may also be required.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 110.61   Documentation a requester who is determined to be eligible must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of lost employment income benefits.

#### § § 110.61

        (a) A requester determined by the Secretary to be eligible for Program benefits and who seeks benefits for lost employment income must provide, in addition to the documentation submitted under subpart F of this part, documentation describing:

        (1) The number of days (including partial days) of work missed by the injured countermeasure recipient as a result of the covered injury or its health complications for which employment income was lost ( time sheet from the relevant pay period(s) showing work days missed). As stated in § 110.32(c), days for which an individual used paid leave will be considered days of work for which employment income was received and, therefore, would not qualify for lost employment income benefits. However, if the injured countermeasure recipient reimburses the employer for the paid leave taken and the employer restores the leave that was used, the individual may be eligible for lost employment income benefits for those days; and

        (2) The injured countermeasure recipient's gross employment income at the time the covered injury was sustained ( the individual's Federal tax return or pay stub(s) from all employers at the time of the covered injury); and

        (3) Whether the injured countermeasure recipient had one or more dependents at the time the covered injury was sustained ( the individual's Federal tax return at the time of the covered injury); and

        (4) A list of all third-party payers that have paid, or that may be obligated to pay, benefits to the injured countermeasure recipient for loss of employment income or provide disability and/or retirement benefits for which payment or reimbursement is being sought under this Program (e.g., State workers' compensation programs, disability insurance programs, Uniform Services Retirement Board determinations, Department of Veterans Affairs determinations, etc.). A requester must submit documentation, if available, concerning the amount of such payments or benefits paid or payable to, or on behalf of, the injured countermeasure recipient by third-party payers. If the requester knows of no such third-party payer, he or she must so certify in writing. If, at any time, the requester becomes aware that a third-party payer may have such an obligation, the requester must inform the Secretary within ten business days of becoming aware of this information, even after benefits have been paid by the Program.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 110.62   Documentation a requester who is determined to be an eligible survivor must submit for the Secretary to make a determination of death benefits.

#### § § 110.62

        (a) A requester determined by the Secretary to be an eligible survivor and who seeks a death benefit under § 110.82(b) (the standard calculation) must provide, in addition to the documentation submitted under subpart F of this part, a written certification informing the Secretary whether a disability or death benefit was paid or payable under the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient. If such benefit was provided, the requester must submit documentation showing the amount of the benefit paid by the PSOB Program. If the deceased injured countermeasure recipient was covered under the PSOB and no such benefit was, or will be provided, the certification must explain whether any survivors are eligible for a death benefit under the PSOB Program and, if so, whether a death benefit may be paid or payable under the PSOB Program.

        (b) The legal guardian seeking a death benefit under § 110.82(c) (the alternative calculation) on behalf of a dependent younger than the age of 18 determined by the Secretary to be an eligible survivor must provide, in addition to the documentation submitted under Subpart F of this part, the following:

        (1) Documentation showing that the deceased injured countermeasure recipient is survived by one or more dependents younger than the age of 18. Such documentation must show the date of birth of all such dependents ( copies of birth certificates);

        (2) Documentation showing that the requester is the legal guardian of all of the dependents described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as required under § 110.63(a). If multiple dependents have different legal guardians, the legal guardian of each of the dependents must submit such documentation;

        (3) A written selection by each legal guardian, on behalf of all of the dependents described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for whom he or she is the legal guardian, to receive proportional death benefits under the alternative calculation as described in § 110.82(c), in place of proportional benefits available under the standard calculation as described in § 110.82(b). Written selections are described in § 110.82(c)(1);

        (4) Documentation showing the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's gross employment income at the time the covered injury was sustained ( the decedent's Federal tax return or pay stub(s) from all employers at the time of the covered injury); and

        (5) A description of all third-party payers that have paid for, or that may be required to pay for, the benefits described in § 110.82(c)(3)(i). This description must include the amount of such benefits that have been paid or that may be paid in the future. If the representative knows of no such third-party payer, he or she must so certify in writing. If, at any time, the representative becomes aware that a third-party payer may have such an obligation, he or she must inform the Secretary within ten business days of becoming aware of this information, even after benefits have been paid by the Program.

        § 110.63   Documentation a legal or personal representative must submit when filing on behalf of a minor or on behalf of an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits.

#### § § 110.63

        Before benefits will be paid by the Program to an eligible requester who is a minor or an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits, his or her legal or personal representative must submit the following, in addition to the documentation required under Subpart F of this part and, as applicable, §§ 110.60-110.62:

        (a) For an eligible requester who is a minor:

        (1) Documentation showing that the requester is a minor ( birth certificate); and

        (2) Documentation showing that the representative is the legal guardian of the property or estate of the minor ( appointment of guardianship by a court of competent jurisdiction). If a minor has more than one legal guardian, this documentation is required only of one legal guardian. In the alternative, documentation showing that the minor is considered emancipated under applicable State law. In accordance with § 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive the requirement of documentation of guardianship for good cause.

        (b) For an eligible requester who is an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits:

        (1) Documentation showing that the requester is an adult who lacks this legal capacity (e.g., declaration of legal incapacity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or comparable documentation); and

        (2) A decree by a court of competent jurisdiction establishing a guardianship or conservatorship of the requester's estate under applicable State law, or durable power of attorney, if applicable. In accordance with § 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive this requirement for good cause.

      Subpart H—Secretarial Determinations

        § 110.70   Determinations the Secretary must make before benefits can be paid.

#### § § 110.70

        Before the Secretary will pay benefits under this Program, she must determine that:

        (a) The requester or his or her representative submitted a completed and signed Request Form within the governing filing deadline; and

        (b) The requester meets the eligibility requirements set out in this part (including a determination that a covered injury was sustained); and

        (c) The requester is entitled to receive benefits from the Program. In making this determination, the Secretary will decide the type(s) and amounts of benefits that will be paid to the requester.

        § 110.71   Insufficient documentation for eligibility and benefits determinations.

#### § § 110.71

        In the event that there is insufficient documentation in the Request Package for the Secretary to make the applicable determinations under this part, the Secretary will so notify the requester, or his or her representative. The requester will be given 60 calendar days from the date of the Secretary's notification to submit the required documentation. If the requester is unable to provide the additional documentation, he or she may provide a written explanation of the reason(s) that the requested documentation is unavailable and the efforts the requester has made to obtain the documents. The Secretary may accept such a statement in place of the required documentation or disapprove the Request for Benefits due to insufficient documentation. If insufficient documentation is submitted in response to the Secretary's letter, the Secretary may disapprove the Request for Benefits.

        § 110.72   Sufficient documentation for eligibility and benefits determinations.

#### § § 110.72

        (a)  When the Secretary determines that there is sufficient documentation in the Request Package to evaluate a requester's eligibility, she will begin the review to determine whether the requester is eligible for Program benefits. If the Secretary determines that the requester is not eligible, the Secretary will inform the requester (or his or her representative) in writing of the disapproval, and the right to reconsideration of the determination, as described in subpart J.

        (b)  If the Secretary determines that the requester is eligible for benefits, she will, after receiving adequate documentation from the requester for a benefits determination, either calculate the amount and types of benefits, as described in subpart I of this part, or request additional documentation in order to calculate the benefits that can be paid ( an Explanation of Benefits from the requester's health insurance company, if none was submitted). As provided in subpart J, requesters have the right to reconsideration of the Secretary's determination of the category and amount of benefits payable under the Program.

        (c)  At any time after a Request Form has been filed, the Secretary may ask a requester to supplement or amend the Request Package by providing additional information or documentation.

        § 110.73   Approval of benefits.

#### § § 110.73

        When the Secretary has determined that benefits will be paid to a requester and has calculated the type and amount of such benefits, she will so notify the requester (or his or her representative) in writing. The Secretary will make payments in accordance with § 110.83. Once all benefits have been paid, the Request Package can no longer be amended (except for survivor benefits). The payment determination will constitute final agency action with regard to the particular countermeasure injury that is the subject of the Request for Benefits and payment ( the Request for Benefits is closed with regard to the injury that is the basis of the payment of benefits).

        § 110.74   Disapproval of benefits.

#### § § 110.74

        (a) If the Secretary determines that a requester is not eligible for payments under the Program, the Secretary will disapprove the Request for Benefits and provide the requester, or his or her representative, with written notice of the basis for the disapproval, and the right to reconsideration of the determination, as provided in § 110.90.

        (b) The Secretary may disapprove a Request for Benefits even before the requester has submitted all the required documentation ( the Secretary may determine that a requester did not meet the filing deadline, or that a covered countermeasure was not used or administered).

        (c) The Secretary may re-open a disapproved Request for Benefits on her own accord should medical or scientific evidence later become available to justify a re-determination of the disapproval of eligibility or payments. In extraordinary circumstances, to be determined at the Secretary's discretion, she may re-open a disapproved Request for Benefits even after the requester has exercised the right to reconsideration and the disapproval determination has been upheld in accordance with the procedures set out in § 110.90.

      Subpart I—Calculation and Payment of Benefits

        § 110.80   Calculation of medical benefits.

#### § § 110.80

        In calculating medical benefits, the Secretary will take into consideration all reasonable costs for reasonable and necessary medical items and services to diagnose or treat a countermeasure recipient's covered injury, or to diagnose, treat, or prevent its health complications, as described in § 110.31. The Secretary will consider and may rely upon benefits documentation submitted by the requester ( bills, Explanation of Benefits, and cost-related documentation to support the expenses relating to the covered injury or its health complications), as required by § 110.60. The Secretary will make such payments only to the extent that such costs were not, and will not be, paid by any third-party payer and only if no third-party payer had or has an obligation to pay for or provide such services or items to the requester, except as provided in §§ 110.83(c) and 110.84. There are no caps on the benefits for reasonable and necessary medical expenses that may be provided under the Program.

        § 110.81   Calculation of benefits for lost employment income.

#### § § 110.81

        (a)  Benefits under this section may be paid for days of work lost as a result of a covered injury or its health complications if the injured countermeasure recipient lost employment income for the lost work days as reasonable based on the degree of injury or disability. As stated in § 110.32(c), days for which an individual used paid leave will be considered days of work for which employment income was received and, therefore, would not qualify for lost employment income benefits. However, if the injured countermeasure recipient reimburses the employer for the paid leave taken and the employer restores the leave that was used, the individual may be eligible for lost employment income benefits for those days;

        (1) The Secretary will calculate the rate of benefits to be paid for the lost work days based on the injured countermeasure recipient's gross employment income, which includes income from self-employment, at the time he or she sustained the covered injury. The Secretary may not, except with respect to injured individuals who are minors, consider projected future earnings in this calculation.

        (i) For an injured countermeasure recipient with no dependents at the time the covered injury was sustained, the benefits are 66  percent of the individual's gross employment income at the time of injury.

        (ii) For an injured countermeasure recipient with one or more dependents at the time the covered injury was sustained, the benefits are 75 percent of the individual's gross employment income at the time of injury; and

        (iii) In the case of an injured countermeasure recipient who is a minor, the Secretary may consider the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8113 (authorizing the FECA Program), and any implementing regulations, in determining the amount of payments under this section and the circumstances under which such payments are reasonable and necessary.

        (b)  Benefits for lost employment income paid under the Program that represent future lost employment income will be adjusted annually to account for inflation.

        (c)  The Secretary will reduce the benefits calculated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section according to the limitations described in this paragraph (c):

        (1)  An injured countermeasure recipient will be compensated for ten or more days of work lost if he or she lost employment income for those days as a result of the covered injury (or its health complications). If the number of days of lost employment income due to the covered injury (or its health complications) is fewer than ten, the Secretary will reduce the number of lost work days by five days. If the injured countermeasure recipient lost employment income for a period of five days or fewer, no benefits for lost employment income will be paid. Lost work days do not need to be consecutive. Partial days of lost employment income may be aggregated to calculate the total number of lost work days. The Secretary has the discretion to consider the reasonableness of the number of work days (or partial work days) lost as a result of a covered injury or its health complications in this calculation, and to consider alternative work schedules in determining the number of work days lost.

        (2)  The maximum amount that an injured countermeasure recipient may receive in any one year in benefits for lost employment income under this Program is $50,000.

        (3)  The maximum amount that an injured countermeasure recipient can receive during his or her lifetime in benefits for lost employment income under this Program is the amount of the death benefit calculated under the PSOB Program in the same fiscal year as the year in which this lifetime cap is reached. This amount is the maximum death benefit payable to survivors under this Program using the standard calculation described in § 110.82(b). However, this lifetime cap does not apply if the Secretary determines that the countermeasure recipient has a covered injury (or injuries) meeting the definition of “disability” in section 216(i) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 416(i).

        (4)  The Secretary will not pay benefits for lost employment income after the injured countermeasure recipient reaches the age of 65.

        (d)  From the amount of benefits calculated under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary will make reductions:

        (1) For all payments made, or expected to be made in the future, to the injured countermeasure recipient for compensation of lost employment income or disability or retirement benefits, by any third-party payer in relation to the covered injury or its health complications, consistent with § 110.32(b); and

        (2) So that the total amount of benefits for lost employment income paid to an injured countermeasure recipient under this Program, together with the total amounts paid (or payable) by third-party payers, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, does not exceed 66  percent (or 75 percent, if the injured countermeasure recipient had at least one dependent at the time the covered injury was sustained) of his or her employment income at the time of the covered injury for the lost work days.

        (3) If an injured countermeasure recipient receives a lump-sum payment from any third-party payer under any obligation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider such a payment to be received over a period of years, rather than in a single year. The Secretary has discretion as to how to apportion such payments over multiple years.

        § 110.82   Calculation of death benefits.

#### § § 110.82

        (a)  (1) If the legal guardian(s) of dependents younger than 18 years of age does not file a written selection to receive death benefits under the alternative calculation, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or if the Secretary does not approve such a selection, the Secretary will pay proportionate death benefits under the standard calculation to all of the eligible survivors with priority to receive death benefits under the standard calculation, as described in § 110.33(b) and paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) If the Secretary approves a written selection to receive benefits under the alternative calculation, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

        (i) If no other eligible survivors are of equal priority to receive death benefits, the Secretary will pay a death benefit in an amount calculated under the alternative calculation to the aggregate of the dependents on whose behalf the election was filed; and

        (ii) If other eligible survivors are of equal priority to receive death benefits as the dependents receiving death benefits under the alternative calculation, the Secretary will pay the other eligible survivors a proportionate amount of the death benefit available and calculated under the standard calculation. In such circumstances, the Secretary will pay the aggregate of the dependents receiving a death benefit under the alternative calculation a proportionate share of the benefits available under that calculation (in place of the proportionate share of the death benefit that would be available under the standard calculation). For example, if a deceased countermeasure recipient is survived by a dependent ten year-old child and a spouse who is not the child's legal guardian ( the dependent child's parents were the deceased injured countermeasure recipient and his or her former spouse), the current surviving spouse would be able to receive his or her share of the death benefit under the standard calculation, and the dependent child's legal guardian, on behalf of the minor, would receive either the child's proportionate share of the death benefit under the standard calculation or the child's proportionate share of the death benefit available under the alternative calculation (if the legal guardian filed a written selection for such a death benefit and the Secretary approved the selection).

        (b)  (1) The maximum death benefit available under the standard calculation of death benefits (described in this paragraph) is the amount of the comparable death benefit calculated under the PSOB Program in the same fiscal year in which the injured countermeasure recipient died (regardless of whether the PSOB Program reduces the amount of its death benefits because of a limit in appropriations).

        (2) No death benefit will be paid under the standard calculation if a death benefit is paid, or if survivors are eligible to receive a death benefit, under the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient.

        (3) The death benefit will not be reduced under the standard calculation if a total and permanent disability benefit has been, or will be paid under the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient. However, the death benefit will be reduced if a temporary and partial disability benefit has been, or will be paid under the PSOB Program with respect to that individual. If the PSOB Program disability benefit paid was reduced because of a limitation on appropriations, a death benefit will be available under the standard calculation to the extent necessary to ensure that the total amount of disability benefits paid under the PSOB Program, together with the amount of death benefits paid under the standard calculation, equals the amount of the death benefit described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (4) Under the standard calculation, death benefits will be paid in a lump sum.

        (c)  If a deceased countermeasure recipient had at least one dependent who is younger than the age of 18 (and will be younger than the age of 18 at the time of the payment), the legal guardian(s) of all such dependents may request benefits under the alternative calculation described in this paragraph. To receive such a benefit, the legal guardian, on behalf of all such dependents for whom he or she is the legal guardian, must file a selection to receive benefits under the alternative calculation, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the Secretary must approve such selection. If multiple dependents have different legal guardians, each legal guardian is responsible for requesting benefits under the standard calculation or for filing a selection for a death benefit under the alternative calculation. If a single dependent has more than one legal guardian, one legal guardian may file the selection. Payments made under the alternative calculation will be made to the legal guardian(s) of all of the dependents on behalf of all of those dependents until they reach the age of 18.

        (1)  Before a payment of a death benefit will be approved under the alternative calculation, the legal guardian(s) of the dependents for whom he or she is the legal guardian must file a written selection, on behalf of all such dependents, to receive a death benefit under the alternative calculation. If such a selection is approved by the Secretary, these dependents will be paid a proportionate share of the death benefit under the alternative calculation in place of the proportionate share of benefits that would otherwise be available to them under the standard calculation.

        (2)  The maximum death benefit available under this paragraph is 75 percent of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's income (including income from self-employment) at the time he or she sustained the covered injury that resulted in death, adjusted to account for inflation, except as follows:

        (i) The maximum payment of death benefits that may be made on behalf of the aggregate of the dependents in any one year is $50,000;

        (ii) All payments made under this paragraph will stop once the youngest of the dependents reaches the age of 18.

        (3)  The total amount of death benefits provided under the alternative calculation (described in this paragraph) will be reduced so that the total amount of payments made (or expected to be made) under obligations described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, together with the death benefits paid under the alternative calculation, is _not_ greater than the amount of payments described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In other words, the total amount of death benefits paid to dependents under the alternative calculation may be reduced if third-party payers have paid (or are expected to pay) for certain benefits so that such dependents will receive a total sum (combining the death benefit under the alternative calculation and the actual and expected benefits covered by third-party payers) that is not greater than the death benefit that would be available under the alternative calculation if there were no third-party payer(s) to pay such benefits. The total amount of death benefits will  be reduced by lost employment income paid by the Program.

        (i) The amount of death benefits paid under the alternative calculation will be reduced for all payments made, or expected to be made in the future, by any third-party payer for:

        (A) Compensation for the deceased countermeasure recipient's loss of employment income on behalf of the dependents or their legal guardians(s) (but not any lost employment income benefits paid by the Program);

        (B) Disability, retirement, or death benefits in relation to the deceased countermeasure recipient (including, but not limited to, death and disability benefits under the PSOB Program) on behalf of the dependents or their legal guardian(s); and

        (C) Life insurance benefits on behalf of the dependents;

        (4)  Payments made under this paragraph will be made on an annual basis, beginning from the time of the initial payment, to the legal guardian(s) on behalf of the aggregate of the dependents receiving the payment. In the year in which the youngest dependent reaches the age of 18, payments under this section will be paid on a  basis for the period of time before that dependent reaches the age of 18. Once a dependent reaches the age of 18, the payments under this alternative calculation will no longer be made on his or her behalf. Because payments under the alternative calculation are to be made on behalf of dependents who are younger than the age of 18, if a dependent meets this requirement at the time of filing of the Request Form, but reaches the age of 18 (or is older than 18 years of age) at the time of the initial payment, no payment will be made to the dependent's legal guardian on his or her behalf under the alternative calculation.

        § 110.83   Payment of all benefits.

#### § § 110.83

        (a) The Secretary determines the mechanism of payment of Program benefits. She may choose to pay any benefits under this Program through lump-sum payments. If the Secretary determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the payments of medical benefits, benefits for lost employment income, or death benefits paid under the alternative calculation (described in § 110.82(c)) will be required for a period in excess of one year from the date the Secretary determines the requester is eligible for such benefits, payments may be made through a lump-sum payment, the purchase of an annuity or medical insurance policy, establishment of a trust (including a U.S. grantor reversionary trust) or execution of an appropriate structured settlement agreement, at the Secretary's discretion. Payments, annuities, policies, or agreements must be actuarially determined to have a value equal to the present value of the projected total amount of benefits that the requester is eligible to receive under §§ 110.80, 110.81, and 110.82. Lump sum payments will be made through an electronic funds transfer to an account of the requester.

        (b) If the requester is a minor, the payment will be made on the minor's behalf to the account of the legal guardian of the estate or property of the minor. In accepting such payments, the legal guardian of a minor requester is obligated to use the funds for the benefit of the minor and to take any actions necessary to comply with State law requirements pertaining to such payments. If the requester is an adult who lacks the legal capacity to receive payment(s), the legal guardian must establish a guardianship or conservatorship of the estate account with court oversight, in accordance with State law, and payment will be made to that account. Documentation of guardianship (or conservatorship) is required for requesters who are minors or adults who lack legal capacity unless the Secretary waives this requirement for good cause.

        (c) The Secretary has the discretion to make interim payments of benefits under this Program, even before a final determination as to the type(s) and total amount of benefits that will be paid. Interim payments will be made only in exceptional cases. The Secretary may, for example, make an interim payment of medical benefits that have been calculated before a final determination on benefits for lost employment income is completed, or of past medical benefits that have been calculated before a final calculation of future medical benefits is completed. The Secretary may make an interim payment even before a final eligibility or benefits determination is made ( if a piece of documentation has not been obtained because a person with a severe countermeasure-related injury is hospitalized, but all other documentation is consistent with the requester meeting the eligibility requirements). If such a requester's documentation is incomplete, the requester must submit the required documentation within the time-frame determined by the Secretary. The requester must agree that he or she will be obligated to repay the Secretary such benefits in the event that a Program payment is later determined to be incorrect. Any payments made on an interim basis will not entitle a requester to seek reconsideration of the Secretary's decision on these benefits until the Secretary makes a final benefits determination.

        § 110.84   The Secretary's right to recover benefits paid under this Program from third-party payers.

#### § § 110.84

        Upon payment of benefits under this Program, the Secretary will be subrogated to the rights of the requester and may assert a claim against any third-party payer with a legal or contractual obligation to pay for (or provide) such benefits and may recover from such third-party payer(s) the amount of benefits paid up to the amount of benefits the third-party payer has or had an obligation to pay for (or provide). In other words, the Secretary may pay benefits before the requester receives a payment from a third-party payer in certain circumstances. In those circumstances, the Secretary has a right to be reimbursed by the third-party payer. The circumstances in which the Secretary may assert this right include those in which the Secretary pays benefits under this Program to a requester before a final decision is made that a third-party payer has an obligation to pay such benefits to the requester. Requesters receiving benefits under this Program (or their representatives) shall assist the Secretary in recovering such benefits. In the event that a requester receives a benefit from a third-party payer after receiving the same type of benefits from the Secretary under this Program, the Secretary has a right to recover from the requester the amount of the benefit(s) received. The requester must notify and reimburse the Program within ten business days of receiving the third-party payment(s).

      Subpart J—Reconsideration of the Secretary's Determinations

        § 110.90   Reconsideration of the Secretary's eligibility and benefits determinations.

#### § § 110.90

        (a)  A requester has the right to seek reconsideration of the Secretary's determination that he or she is not eligible for Program benefits. In addition, a requester who asserts that the amount of the benefits paid (or the fact that certain benefits were not paid or payable) is incorrect may also seek reconsideration. A requester may not seek reconsideration of the Secretary's decision as to the mechanism of payment. Requests for reconsideration must be in writing, describe the reason(s) why the decision should be reconsidered, and be postmarked within 60 calendar days of the date of the Secretary's decision on the Request for Benefits. Because no new documentation will be considered in the reconsideration process, the reconsideration request may not include or refer to any documentation that was not before the Secretary at the time of her determination.

        (b)  A requester, or his or her representative, may send the letter seeking reconsideration through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial carrier, or a private courier service. The Secretary will not accept reconsideration requests delivered by hand. Electronic submissions of letters seeking reconsideration are not currently accepted, but may be accepted in the future. The Program will publish a notice if an electronic method becomes available. Letters sent through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial carrier or private courier service must be sent to the Associate Administrator, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 12-105, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

        (c)  When the Associate Administrator of the Healthcare Systems Bureau (the Associate Administrator), receives a request for reconsideration, a qualified panel, independent of the Program, will be convened to review the Secretary's determination. The panel will base its recommendation on the documentation before the Secretary when the determination was made. The panel will perform its own review and make its own findings, which will be submitted to the Associate Administrator. The Associate Administrator will then review the panel's recommendation(s) and make a final determination, which will be sent to the requester (or his or her representative). This will be the Secretary's final action on the request for reconsideration and will be considered the Secretary's final determination on the request for Program benefits with regard to the injury that is the subject of that Request Package. Requesters may not seek review of a decision made on reconsideration.

        (d)  As stated in § 110.46, a Request Package cannot be amended after exhaustion of the reconsideration process, except for amendments by survivors seeking death benefits or executors or administrators on behalf of an estate.

        § 110.91   Secretary's review authority.

#### § § 110.91

        Under section 319F-4(b)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6e(b)(4)) (referencing section 262 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 239a)), the Secretary may, at any time, on her own motion or on application, review any determination made under this part (including, but not limited to, determinations concerning eligibility, entitlement to benefits, and the calculation of amount of benefits under the Program). Upon review, the Secretary may affirm, vacate, or modify the determination in any manner the Secretary deems appropriate.

        § 110.92   No additional judicial or administrative review of determinations made under this part.

#### § § 110.92

        (a) Under section 319F-4(b)(4) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6e(b)(4)) (referencing section 262 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 239a)), no judicial review of the Secretary's actions concerning eligibility and benefits determinations under this part (including, but not limited to, determinations concerning eligibility, the type or amount of benefits, and the method of payment of benefits) is permitted. In addition, no further administrative review of such actions are permitted unless the President specifically directs otherwise.

        (b) Under section 319F-4(b)(5)(c) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6e(b)(5)(c)), no judicial review of the Secretary's actions in establishing or amending a Table (or Tables) for purposes of this part (which include, but are not limited to, identifying injuries on a Table (or choosing not to identify injuries on a Table), establishing time-frames or definitions for Table injuries, and amending a Table) is permitted.

      Subpart K—Covered Countermeasures Injury Tables

        § 110.100   Injury Tables.

#### § § 110.100

        (a)

        (b)  The following definitions and requirements shall apply to the Table set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and only apply for purposes of this subpart.

        (1)  Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, and potentially lethal systemic reaction that occurs as a single discrete event with simultaneous involvement of two or more organ systems. Most cases resolve without  Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and/or trachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. There are no specific pathological findings to confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

        (2)  Deltoid bursitis is an inflammation of the bursa that lies beneath the deltoid muscle and between the acromion process and the rotator cuff. Subdeltoid bursitis manifests with pain in the lateral aspect of the shoulder similar to rotator cuff tendonitis. The presence of tenderness on direct palpation beneath the acromion process distinguishes this bursitis from rotator cuff tendonitis. Similar to tendonitis, isolated bursitis will have full passive range of motion. Other causes of bursitis such as trauma (other than from vaccination), metabolic disorders, and systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, dialysis, and infection will not be considered Table injuries. This list is not exhaustive. The deltoid bursitis must occur in the same shoulder that received the pandemic influenza vaccine.

        (3)  Vasovagal syncope (also sometimes called neurocardiogenic syncope) means loss of consciousness (fainting) and loss of postural tone caused by a transient decrease in blood flow to the brain occurring after the administration of an injected countermeasure. Vasovagal syncope is usually a benign condition but may result in falling and injury with significant  Vasovagal syncope may be preceded by symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and/or pallor. Vasovagal syncope may be associated with transient seizure-like activity, but recovery of orientation and consciousness generally occurs simultaneously. Loss of consciousness resulting from the following conditions will not be considered vasovagal syncope: Organic heart disease; cardiac arrhythmias; transient ischemic attacks; hyperventilation; metabolic conditions; neurological conditions; psychiatric conditions; seizures; trauma; and situational as can occur with urination, defecation, or cough. This list is not complete. Episodes of recurrent syncope occurring after the applicable time period are not considered to be  of an episode of syncope meeting the Table requirements.

        (4)  (i) GBS is an acute monophasic peripheral neuropathy that currently is known to encompass a spectrum of four clinicopathological subtypes described below. For each subtype of GBS, the interval between the first appearance of symptoms and the nadir of weakness is between 12 hours and 28 days. This is followed in all subtypes by a clinical plateau with stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse. Death may occur without a clinical plateau. Treatment related fluctuations in all subtypes of GBS can occur within 9 weeks of GBS symptom onset and recurrence of symptoms after this time frame would not be consistent with GBS.

        (ii) The most common subtype in North America and Europe, comprising more than 90 percent of cases, is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) which has the pathologic and electrodiagnostic features of focal demyelination of motor and sensory peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Another subtype called acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is generally seen in other parts of the world and is predominated by axonal damage that primarily affects motor nerves. AMAN lacks features of demyelination. Another less common subtype of GBS includes acute motor and sensory neuropathy (AMSAN), which is an axonal form of GBS that is similar to AMAN, but also affects the sensory nerves and roots. AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN are typically characterized by symmetric motor flaccid weakness, sensory abnormalities, and/or autonomic dysfunction caused by autoimmune damage to peripheral nerves and nerve roots. The diagnosis of AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN requires bilateral flaccid limb weakness and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs; a monophasic illness pattern; an interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days; subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse); and, the absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis. Death may occur without a clinical plateau.

        (iii) Fisher syndrome (FS), also known as Miller-Fisher Syndrome, is a subtype of GBS characterized by ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia, and overlap between FS and AIDP may be seen with limb weakness. The diagnosis of FS requires bilateral ophthalmoparesis; bilateral reduced or absent tendon reflexes; ataxia; the absence of limb weakness (the presence of limb weakness suggests a diagnosis of AIDP); a monophasic illness pattern; an interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days; subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse); no alteration in consciousness; no corticospinal track signs; and, the absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis. Death may occur without a clinical plateau.

        (iv) Evidence that is supportive, but not required, of a diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS includes electrophysiologic findings consistent with GBS or an elevation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein with a total CSF white blood cell count below 50 cells per microliter. The results of both CSF and electrophysiologic studies are frequently normal in the first week of illness in otherwise typical cases of GBS.

        (v) For GBS to qualify as a Table injury there must not be a more likely alternative diagnosis for the weakness. Exclusionary criteria for the diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS include the ultimate diagnosis of any of the following conditions: Chronic immune demyelinating polyradiculopathy (“CIDP”), carcinomatous meningitis, brain stem encephalitis (other than Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis), myelitis, spinal cord infarct, spinal cord compression, anterior horn cell diseases such as polio or West Nile virus infection, subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, cauda equina compression, metabolic conditions such as hypermagnesemia or hypophosphatemia, tick paralysis, heavy metal toxicity (such as arsenic, gold, or thallium), drug-induced neuropathy (such as vincristine, platinum compounds, or nitrofurantoin), porphyria, critical illness neuropathy, vasculitis, diphtheria, myasthenia gravis, organophosphate poisoning, botulism, critical illness myopathy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia. The above list is not exhaustive.

        (5)  (i) Postintubation tracheal stenosis means an iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment) and symptomatic stricture of the airway (narrowing of the windpipe) resulting from:

        (A) Trauma or necrosis from an endotracheal tube; or

        (B) Stomal injury from a tracheostomy; or

        (C) A combination of the two.

        (ii) Tracheal stenosis or narrowing due to tumors (malignant or benign), infections of the trachea (such as tuberculosis, fungal diseases), radiotherapy, tracheal surgery, trauma, congenital, and inflammatory or autoimmune diseases will not be considered post-intubation tracheal stenosis. Post-intubation tracheal stenosis requires either tracheostomy with placement of a tracheostomy tube or endotracheal intubation. Diagnosis requires symptoms of upper airway obstruction such as stridor (inspiratory wheeze) or exertional dyspnea (increased shortness of breath with exertion), and positive radiologic studies showing abnormal narrowing of the trachea or bronchoscopic evaluation that demonstrates abnormal narrowing.

        (6)  (i) VAP is defined as an iatrogenic pneumonia caused by the medical treatment of mechanical ventilation. Similarly, VAT is an iatrogenic infection of the trachea and/or bronchi caused by mechanical ventilation. The initial manifestation of VAP and VAT must occur more than 48 hours after intubation (placement of the breathing tube) and up to 48 hours after extubation (removal of the breathing tube). VAP will be considered to be present when the patient demonstrates a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate that is in the lungs and consistent with pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) or leucopenia (decreased white blood cell count), purulent (containing pus) tracheal secretions from a tracheal aspirate, and a positive lower respiratory tract culture. The positive lower respiratory tract culture is a diagnostic requirement only if there has not been a change in antibiotics in the 72 hours prior to collection of the culture. In addition, a tracheal aspirate that does not demonstrate bacteria or inflammatory cells in a patient without a change in antibiotics in the previous 72 hours is unlikely to be VAP and shall not be considered a condition set forth in the Table.

        (ii) VAT will be considered to be present when the patient demonstrates fever, leukocytosis or leukopenia, purulent tracheal secretions, and a positive tracheal aspirate culture in the absence of a change of antibiotics within the 72 hours prior to culture. Tracheal colonization with microorganisms is common in intubated patients, but in the absence of clinical findings is not a sign of VAT.

        (7)  VILI results from mechanical trauma such as volutrauma leading to rupture of alveoli (air sacs in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged with the blood) with subsequent abnormal leakage of air. VILI manifests as iatrogenic pneumothorax (abnormal air from alveolar rupture in the pleural space), pneumomediastinum (abnormal air from alveolar rupture in the mediastinum (middle part of the chest between the lungs)), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (abnormal air in the lung interstitial space between the alveoli), subpleural air cysts (an extreme form of pulmonary emphysema where the abnormal air in the interstitial space has pooled into larger pockets), subcutaneous emphysema (abnormal air from alveolar rupture that has dissected into the skin), pneumopericardium (abnormal air from alveolar rupture that has traveled to the pericardium (covering of the heart)), pneumoperitoneum (abnormal air from alveolar rupture that has moved into the abdominal space), or systemic air embolism (abnormal air from alveolar rupture that has moved into the blood). To qualify as Table injuries, these manifestations must occur in patients who are being mechanically ventilated at the time of initial manifestation of the VILI.

        (8)  Bleeding events are defined as excessive or abnormal bleeding in patients who are under the pharmacologic effects of anticoagulant therapy provided for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment.

        (c)

        (d)  The following definitions and requirements shall apply to the Table set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and only apply for purposes of this subpart.

        (1)  Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, and potentially lethal systemic reaction that occurs as a single discrete event with simultaneous involvement of two or more organ systems. Most cases resolve without  Signs and symptoms begin within minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and/or trachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. There are no specific pathological findings to confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

        (2)  Vasovagal syncope (also sometimes called neurocardiogenic syncope) means loss of consciousness (fainting) and loss of postural tone caused by a transient decrease in blood flow to the brain occurring after the administration of an injected countermeasure. Vasovagal syncope is usually a benign condition, but may result in falling and injury with significant  Vasovagal syncope may be preceded by symptoms, such as nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis (sweating), and/or pallor. Vasovagal syncope may be associated with transient seizure-like activity, but recovery of orientation and consciousness generally occurs simultaneously. Loss of consciousness resulting from the following conditions will not be considered vasovagal syncope: Organic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic attacks, hyperventilation, metabolic conditions, neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions, seizures, trauma, and situational as can occur with urination, defecation, or cough. This list is not complete as other conditions that are not associated with the vaccine also may cause loss of consciousness. Episodes of recurrent syncope occurring after the applicable timeframe are not considered to be  of an episode of syncope meeting the Table 2 requirements.

        (3)  Significant local skin reaction is an unexpected and extreme response at the vaccination or inoculation site that results in a significant scar that is serious enough to require surgical intervention. The onset of this injury is the initial skin lesion at the vaccination site that generally occurs with replication-competent smallpox vaccinations. Minor scarring or minor local reactions do not constitute a Table 2 injury. A robust take, defined as an area of redness at the vaccination site that exceeds 7.5 cm in diameter with associated swelling, warmth and pain, is generally considered an expected response to the vaccination or inoculation. A robust take, in itself, does not constitute a Table 2 injury, even when the redness and swelling involves the entire upper arm with associated enlargement and tenderness of the glands (lymph nodes) in the underarm (axilla).

        (4)  SJS/TEN is a spectrum of acute hypersensitivity reactions that affects skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes, internal organs (systemic toxicity) associated with the use or administration of replication- competent smallpox vaccines. For purposes of Table 2, both skin and mucous membrane rash or lesions must be present. Rash or lesion distribution must be widespread. Rash must not have a symmetric acral distribution (affecting arms, hands, legs or feet). Two or more mucosal sites must be involved. Mucosal lesions generally manifest as painful lesions in sites, such as the mouth or eyes. Skin rash or lesions in SJS/TEN usually consist of red or purple raised areas (erythematous macules), blisters, and ulcerations.

        (5)  IA is the spread of  virus from an existing vaccination site to a second location usually by scratching the vaccination site and subsequently spreading the virus, which produces a new  lesion on the same person who received the vaccination. IA is the most common adverse event associated with the replication-competent smallpox vaccine.

        (6)  GV is a  infection that occurs from the spread of  from an existing vaccination or inoculation site, with the use or administration of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine, to otherwise normal skin, resulting in multiple new areas of  rash or lesions. The  is believed to be spread through the blood. The rash or lesions, characterized by multiple blisters (vesicles or pustules), generally evolve in a similar sequence or manner as the original vaccination site.

        (7)  EV is the transmission or the spread of  virus from a vaccination site, after the use or administration of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine, to skin that has been affected by, or is currently affected with, eczema or atopic dermatitis. EV is characterized by lesions that include multiple blisters (vesicles or pustules), which generally evolve in a similar sequence or manner as the original vaccination site. The lesions may come together to form larger lesions. Lesions may also spread to patches of skin that have never been involved with eczema or atopic dermatitis. The new lesions, if cultured, will be positive for  virus. A person with EV may become severely ill with signs and symptoms that involve the whole body (systemic illness), such as fever, malaise, or enlarged glands (lymph nodes).

        (8)  PV is the failure to initiate the healing process in an initial vaccination or inoculation site, after the use or administration of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine, by 21 days after exposure to  with progressive ulceration or necrosis at the vaccination site leading to a large destructive ulcer. PV is seen in people who are immunocompromised (have an impaired immune system) and is characterized by a complete or near complete lack of inflammation or absence of inflammatory cells in the dermis of the skin at the vaccination site. The diagnosis of PV may be made before 21 days after exposure, especially in a known immunocompromised individual who develops a lesion at the vaccination site. PV may spread through the blood to any location in the body. No one who experiences a significant healing process of the vaccination site within 21 days after receipt of the replication-competent smallpox vaccine or exposure to  has PV.

        (9)  PVEM is a spectrum of overlapping conditions that includes post- encephalopathy, encephalitis, and encephalomyelitis, and, for the purposes of Table 2, is treated as one injury. For the purposes of Table 2, PVEM is an autoimmune central nervous system injury that occurs after the use or administration of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine. In rare cases, the  virus is isolated from the central nervous system. Manifestations usually occur abruptly and may include fever, vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), headache, general malaise, impaired consciousness, confusion, disorientation, delirium, drowsiness, seizures, language difficulties (aphasia), coma, muscular incoordination (ataxia), urinary incontinence, urinary retention, and clinical signs consistent with inflammation of the spinal cord (myelitis), such as paralysis or meningismus (meningeal irritation). Long-term central nervous system impairments, such as paralysis, seizure disorders, or developmental delays are known to occur as  of the acute PVEM. No clinical criteria, radiographic findings, or laboratory tests are specific for the diagnosis of PVEM. Symptoms that occur before 5 days or more than 14 days after receiving the smallpox vaccine should not be attributed to it. In addition, encephalopathy caused by an infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder, or trauma would not meet the Table 2 definition.

        (10)  For purposes of Table 2, MP is  myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.  myocarditis is defined as an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) because of receiving the replication-competent smallpox vaccine.  pericarditis is defined as an inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericardium) because of receiving the smallpox vaccine.  myopericarditis is defined as an inflammation of both the heart muscle and its covering because of receiving the smallpox vaccine. The inflammation associated with MP may range in severity from very mild (subclinical) to life threatening. In many mild cases, myocarditis is diagnosed solely by transient electrocardiographic (EKG) abnormalities ( ST segment and T wave changes), increased cardiac enzymes, or mild echocardiographic abnormalities. Arrhythmias, abnormal heart sounds, heart failure, and death may occur in more severe cases. Pericarditis generally manifests with chest pain, abnormal heart sounds (pericardial friction rub), EKG abnormalities ( ST segment and T wave changes), and/or increased fluid accumulation around the heart. A Table 2 injury of MP requires sufficient evidence in the medical records of the occurrence of acute MP.

        (11)  TRALI is defined as the onset of respiratory distress within 6 hours in non-critically ill patients, and 72 hours in critically ill patients, after receipt of blood products containing plasma, in this case, VIGIV. The relative level of illness will be determined on a case-by-case basis after reviewing the medical records and the medical history. The respiratory distress is the result of receiving a plasma containing transfusion (VIGIV) and subsequently developing pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. TRALI occurs as the result of an antibody response in the host to the donor antibodies within the plasma product. Pulmonary edema is non-cardiac in nature and does not occur more than 72 hours after receiving VIGIV. Pulmonary edema occurring more than 72 hours after receiving a blood product containing plasma (VIGIV) or associated with cardiac dysfunction is not TRALI and is excluded as a countermeasure-related injury. TRALI has been identified as a major cause of mortality in those individual receiving plasma-containing transfusions. A Table 2 injury for TRALI has occurred in a recipient if there is sufficient evidence in the medical record of an occurrence of TRALI and the pulmonary edema is not caused by cardiac dysfunction or other causes and occurs within 72 of receiving a blood product containing plasma, in this case VIGIV.

        (12)  ARF is the sudden loss of the kidneys' ability to perform their main function of eliminating excess fluids and electrolytes (salts), as well as waste material from the blood. ARF, which is also called acute kidney injury, develops rapidly over a few hours or a few days. ARF can be fatal and requires intensive treatment; however, ARF may be reversible. ARF may cause permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease necessitating dialysis or transplant. A Table 2 injury for ARF has occurred if there is sufficient evidence in the medical record of an occurrence of ARF within the identified timeframe and the individual received the associated countermeasure (VIGIV).

        (13)  (i) DIAM is an inflammation of the meninges (linings of the brain) that is not caused by a bacteria or virus, but is caused by a drug or medication. The symptoms of meningitis include severe headache, nuchal (neck) rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia (light sensitivity), painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting. Discontinuation of the medication leads to a resolution of the symptoms. DIAM is thought to occur because of an immunological hypersensitivity reaction to a specific medication. In the case of immunoglobulins, DIAM may be precipitated by the immunologically active components within the plasma or because of the stabilizers used within the product. The symptoms of DIAM may reoccur with another exposure to the offending agent.

        (ii) A Table 2 injury for DIAM has occurred in a recipient if there is sufficient evidence in the medical record of an occurrence of DIAM within the identified timeframe and the individual received the associated countermeasure (VIGIV). DIAM occurring in the absence of the use of VIGIV, or DIAM occurring with the use of VIGIV outside the established timeframe of onset, which is any time after the first dose and up to 48 hours after the last dose of this medication, is not a Table 2 injury.

        (14)  Hemolysis is the physical breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs) either through natural attrition or as caused by external factors. The RBC's function is to transport oxygen throughout the body in the hemoglobin contained within the RBC. Additionally, the RBCs contain the majority of the body's potassium stores. With hemolysis, the body is unable to transport oxygen effectively, and the person develops hypoxia. Additionally, the rapid breakdown of the cell releases large amounts of potassium into the blood stream, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest. In severe cases of hemolysis, a blood transfusion may be required to correct the resulting anemia. A Table 2 injury for hemolysis has occurred if there is sufficient evidence in the medical record of an occurrence of hemolysis, and the patient received the associated countermeasure (VIGIV). Hemolysis occurring in the absence of the use of VIGIV and outside of the timeframe of 12 hours to 14 days after receiving VIGIV is not a Table 2 injury. Hemolysis occurring from a more likely alternative diagnosis, such as infections, toxins, poisons, hemodialysis, or medications, is not a Table 2 injury. This list of conditions that can cause hemolysis, not associated with VIGIV, is not exhaustive, and all additional diagnoses within the medical documentation will be evaluated.

      § 121.4   OPTN policies: Secretarial review and appeals.

#### § § 121.4

      (a) The OPTN Board of Directors shall be responsible for developing, with the advice of the OPTN membership and other interested parties, policies within the mission of the OPTN as set forth in section 372 of the Act and the Secretary's contract for the operation of the OPTN, including:

      (1) Policies for the equitable allocation of cadaveric organs in accordance with § 121.8;

      (2) Policies, consistent with recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the testing of organ donors and follow-up of transplant recipients to prevent the spread of infectious diseases;

      (3) Policies that reduce inequities resulting from socioeconomic status, including, but not limited to:

      (i) Ensuring that payment of the registration fee is not a barrier to listing for patients who are unable to pay the fee;

      (ii) Procedures for transplant hospitals to make reasonable efforts to obtain from all available sources, financial resources for patients unable to pay such that these patients have an opportunity to obtain a transplant and necessary follow-up care;

      (iii) Recommendations to private and public payers and service providers on ways to improve coverage of organ transplantation and necessary follow-up care; and

      (iv) Reform of allocation policies based on assessment of their cumulative effect on socioeconomic inequities;

      (4) Policies regarding the training and experience of transplant surgeons and transplant physicians in designated transplant programs as required by § 121.9;

      (5) Policies for nominating officers and members of the Board of Directors; and

      (6) Policies on such other matters as the Secretary directs.

      (b) The Board of Directors shall:

      (1) Provide opportunity for the OPTN membership and other interested parties to comment on proposed policies and shall take into account the comments received in developing and adopting policies for implementation by the OPTN; and

      (2) Provide to the Secretary, at least 60 days prior to their proposed implementation, proposed policies it recommends to be enforceable under § 121.10 (including allocation policies). These policies will not be enforceable until approved by the Secretary. The Board of Directors shall also provide to the Secretary, at least 60 days prior to their proposed implementation, proposed policies on such other matters as the Secretary directs. The Secretary will refer significant proposed policies to the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation established under § 121.12, and publish them in the  for public comment. The Secretary also may seek the advice of the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation established under § 121.12 on other proposed policies, and publish them in the  for public comment. The Secretary will determine whether the proposed policies are consistent with the National Organ Transplant Act and this part, taking into account the views of the Advisory Committee and public comments. Based on this review, the Secretary may provide comments to the OPTN. If the Secretary concludes that a proposed policy is inconsistent with the National Organ Transplant Act or this part, the Secretary may direct the OPTN to revise the proposed policy consistent with the Secretary's direction. If the OPTN does not revise the proposed policy in a timely manner, or if the Secretary concludes that the proposed revision is inconsistent with the National Organ Transplant Act or this part, the Secretary may take such other action as the Secretary determines appropriate, but only after additional consultation with the Advisory Committee on the proposed action.

      (c) The OPTN Board of Directors shall provide the membership and the Secretary with copies of its policies as they are adopted, and make them available to the public upon request. The Secretary will publish lists of OPTN policies in the  indicating which ones are enforceable under § 121.10 or subject to potential sanctions of section 1138 of the Social Security Act. The OPTN shall also continuously maintain OPTN policies for public access on the Internet, including current and proposed policies.

      (d) Any interested individual or entity may submit to the Secretary in writing critical comments related to the manner in which the OPTN is carrying out its duties or Secretarial policies regarding the OPTN. Any such comments shall include a statement of the basis for the comments. The Secretary will seek, as appropriate, the comments of the OPTN on the issues raised in the comments related to OPTN policies or practices. Policies or practices that are the subject of critical comments remain in effect during the Secretary's review, unless the Secretary directs otherwise based on possible risk to the health of patients or to public safety. The Secretary will consider the comments in light of the National Organ Transplant Act and the regulations under this part and may consult with the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation established under § 121.12.

      § 121.5   Listing requirements.

#### § § 121.5

      (a) A transplant hospital which is an OPTN member may list individuals, consistent with the OPTN's criteria under § 121.8(b)(1), only for a designated transplant program.

      (b) Transplant hospitals shall assure that individuals are placed on the waiting list as soon as they are determined to be candidates for transplantation. The OPTN shall advise transplant hospitals of the information needed for such listing.

      (c) An OPTN member shall pay a registration fee to the OPTN for each transplant candidate it places on the waiting list. The amount of such fee shall be calculated to cover (together with contract funds awarded by the Secretary) the reasonable costs of operating the OPTN and shall be determined by the OPTN with the approval of the Secretary. No less often than annually, and whether or not a change is proposed, the OPTN shall submit to the Secretary a statement of its proposed registration fee, together with such supporting information as the Secretary finds necessary to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the fee schedule and projected revenues. This submission is due at least three months before the beginning of the OPTN's fiscal year. The Secretary will approve, modify, or disapprove the amount of the fee within a reasonable time of receiving the OPTN's submission.

      § 121.6   Organ procurement.

#### § § 121.6

      The suitability of organs donated for transplantation shall be determined as follows:

      (a)  An OPTN member procuring an organ shall assure that laboratory tests and clinical examinations of potential organ donors are performed to determine any contraindications for donor acceptance, in accordance with policies established by the OPTN.

      (b)  (1) Organs from donors with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be transplanted only into individuals who—

      (i) Are living with HIV before receiving such organ(s); and

      (ii)(A) Are participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board, as defined in 45 CFR part 46, under the research criteria published by the Secretary under subsection (a) of section 377E of the Public Health Service Act, as amended; or

      (B) The Secretary has published, through appropriate procedures, a determination under section 377E(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, that participation in such clinical research, as a requirement for transplantation of organs from donors with HIV, is no longer warranted. The Secretary has determined that participation in such clinical research is no longer warranted for the following categories of transplants:

      () Transplant of a kidney from a donor with HIV; and

      () Transplant of a liver from a donor with HIV.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the OPTN shall adopt and use standards of quality with respect to organs from donors with HIV to the extent the Secretary determines necessary to allow the conduct of research in accordance with the criteria described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.

      (3) If the Secretary has determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section that participation in clinical research is no longer warranted as a requirement for transplantation of organs from donors with HIV, the OPTN shall adopt and use standards of quality with respect to organs from donors with HIV as directed by the Secretary, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 274, and in a way that ensures the changes will not reduce the safety of organ transplantation.

      (c)  Transplant programs shall establish criteria for organ acceptance, and shall provide such criteria to the OPTN and the OPOs with which they are affiliated.

      § 121.7   Identification of organ recipient.

#### § § 121.7

      (a)  (1) An OPTN member procuring an organ shall operate the OPTN computer match program within such time as the OPTN may prescribe to identify and rank potential recipients for each cadaveric organ procured.

      (2) The rank order of potential recipients shall be determined for each cadaveric organ using the organ specific allocation criteria established in accordance with § 121.8.

      (3) When a donor or donor organ does not meet a transplant program's donor acceptance criteria, as established under § 121.6(c), transplant candidates of that program shall not be ranked among potential recipients of that organ and shall not appear on a roster of potential recipients of that organ.

      (b)  (1) Organs shall be offered for potential recipients in accordance with policies developed under § 121.8 and implemented under § 121.4.

      (2) Organs may be offered only to potential recipients listed with transplant programs having designated transplant programs of the same type as the organ procured.

      (3) An organ offer is made when all information necessary to determine whether to transplant the organ into the potential recipient has been given to the transplant hospital.

      (4) A transplant program shall either accept or refuse the offered organ for the designated potential recipient within such time as the OPTN may prescribe. A transplant program shall document and provide to the OPO and to the OPTN the reasons for refusal and shall maintain this document for one year.

      (c) —(1)  The OPTN member that procures a donated organ shall arrange for transportation of the organ to the transplant hospital.

      (2)  The OPTN member that is transporting an organ shall assure that it is accompanied by written documentation of activities conducted to determine the suitability of the organ donor and shall maintain this document for one year.

      (3)  The OPTN member that is transporting an organ shall assure that it is packaged in a manner that is designed to maintain the viability of the organ.

      (d)  Upon receipt of an organ, the transplant hospital responsible for the potential recipient's care shall determine whether to proceed with the transplant. In the event that an organ is not transplanted into the potential recipient, the OPO which has a written agreement with the transplant hospital must offer the organ for another potential recipient in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (e)  A blood vessel that is considered part of an organ under this part shall be subject to the allocation requirements and policies pertaining to the organ with which the blood vessel is procured until and unless the transplant center receiving the organ determines that the blood vessel is not needed for the transplantation of that organ.

      (f)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a transplant program from transplanting an organ into any medically suitable candidate if to do otherwise would result in the organ not being used for transplantation. The transplant program shall notify the OPTN and the OPO which made the organ offer of the circumstances justifying each such action within such time as the OPTN may prescribe.

      § 121.8   Allocation of organs.

#### § § 121.8

      (a)  The Board of Directors established under § 121.3 shall develop, in accordance with the policy development process described in § 121.4, policies for the equitable allocation of cadaveric organs among potential recipients. Such allocation policies:

      (1) Shall be based on sound medical judgment;

      (2) Shall seek to achieve the best use of donated organs;

      (3) Shall preserve the ability of a transplant program to decline an offer of an organ or not to use the organ for the potential recipient in accordance with § 121.7(b)(4)(d) and (e);

      (4) Shall be specific for each organ type or combination of organ types to be transplanted into a transplant candidate;

      (5) Shall be designed to avoid wasting organs, to avoid futile transplants, to promote patient access to transplantation, and to promote the efficient management of organ placement;

      (6) Shall be reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate;

      (7) Shall include appropriate procedures to promote and review compliance including, to the extent appropriate, prospective and retrospective reviews of each transplant program's application of the policies to patients listed or proposed to be listed at the program; and

      (8) Shall not be based on the candidate's place of residence or place of listing, except to the extent required by paragraphs (a)(1)-(5) of this section.

      (b)  Allocation policies shall be designed to achieve equitable allocation of organs among patients consistent with paragraph (a) of this section through the following performance goals:

      (1) Standardizing the criteria for determining suitable transplant candidates through the use of minimum criteria (expressed, to the extent possible, through objective and measurable medical criteria) for adding individuals to, and removing candidates from, organ transplant waiting lists;

      (2) Setting priority rankings expressed, to the extent possible, through objective and measurable medical criteria, for patients or categories of patients who are medically suitable candidates for transplantation to receive transplants. These rankings shall be ordered from most to least medically urgent (taking into account, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and in particular in accordance with sound medical judgment, that life sustaining technology allows alternative approaches to setting priority ranking for patients). There shall be a sufficient number of categories (if categories are used) to avoid grouping together patients with substantially different medical urgency;

      (3) Distributing organs over as broad a geographic area as feasible under paragraphs (a)(1)-(5) of this section, and in order of decreasing medical urgency; and

      (4) Applying appropriate performance indicators to assess transplant program performance under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section and reducing the inter-transplant program variance to as small as can reasonably be achieved in any performance indicator under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section as the Board determines appropriate, and under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. If the performance indicator “waiting time in status” is used for allocation purposes, the OPTN shall seek to reduce the inter-transplant program variance in this indicator, as well as in other selected performance indicators, to as small as can reasonably be achieved, unless to do so would result in transplanting less medically urgent patients or less medically urgent patients within a category of patients.

      (c)  (1) Each organ-specific allocation policy shall include performance indicators. These indicators must measure how well each policy is:

      (i) Achieving the performance goals set out in paragraph (b) of this section; and

      (ii) Giving patients, their families, their physicians, and others timely and accurate information to assess the performance of transplant programs.

      (2) Performance indicators shall include:

      (i) Baseline data on how closely the results of current allocation policies approach the performance goals established under paragraph (b) of this section;

      (ii) With respect to any proposed change, the amount of projected improvement in approaching the performance goals established under paragraph (b) of this section;

      (iii) Such other indicators as the Board may propose and the Secretary approves; and

      (iv) Such other indicators as the Secretary may require.

      (3) For each organ-specific allocation policy, the OPTN shall provide to the Secretary data to assist the Secretary in assessing organ procurement and allocation, access to transplantation, the effect of allocation policies on programs performing different volumes of transplants, and the performance of OPOs and the OPTN contractor. Such data shall be required on performance by organ and status category, including program-specific data, OPO-specific data, data by program size, and data aggregated by organ procurement area, OPTN region, the Nation as a whole, and such other geographic areas as the Secretary may designate. Such data shall include the following measures of inter-transplant program variation: risk-adjusted total life-years pre-and post-transplant, risk-adjusted patient and graft survival rates following transplantation, risk-adjusted waiting time and risk-adjusted transplantation rates, as well as data regarding patients whose status or medical urgency was misclassified and patients who were inappropriately kept off a waiting list or retained on a waiting list. Such data shall cover such intervals of time, and be presented using confidence intervals or other measures of variance, as may be required to avoid spurious results or erroneous interpretation due to small numbers of patients covered.

      (d) —(1)  When the OPTN revises organ allocation policies under this section, it shall consider whether to adopt transition procedures that would treat people on the waiting list and awaiting transplantation prior to the adoption or effective date of the revised policies no less favorably than they would have been treated under the previous policies. The transition procedures shall be transmitted to the Secretary for review together with the revised allocation policies.

      (2)  When the OPTN transmits to the Secretary its initial revision of the liver allocation policies, as directed by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, it shall include transition procedures that, to the extent feasible, treat each individual on the waiting list and awaiting transplantation on October 20, 1999 no less favorably than he or she would have been treated had the revised liver allocation policies not become effective. These transition procedures may be limited in duration or applied only to individuals with greater than average medical urgency if this would significantly improve administration of the list or if such limitations would be applied only after accommodating a substantial preponderance of those disadvantaged by the change in the policies.

      (e)  (1) The OPTN shall conduct an initial review of existing allocation policies and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no later than November 16, 2000 shall transmit initial revised policies to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, together with supporting documentation to the Secretary for review in accordance with § 121.4.

      (2) No later than March 16, 2000 the OPTN shall transmit revised policies and supporting documentation for liver allocation to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to the Secretary for review in accordance with § 121.4. The OPTN may transmit these materials without seeking further public comment under § 121.4(b).

      (f)  The OPTN's transmittal to the Secretary of proposed allocation policies and performance indicators shall include such supporting material, including the results of model-based computer simulations, as the Secretary may require to assess the likely effects of policy changes and as are necessary to demonstrate that the proposed policies comply with the performance indicators and transition procedures of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

      (g)  The OPTN may develop, in accordance with § 121.4, experimental policies that test methods of improving allocation. All such experimental policies shall be accompanied by a research design and include data collection and analysis plans. Such variances shall be time limited. Entities or individuals objecting to variances may appeal to the Secretary under the procedures of § 121.4.

      (h)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the allocation of an organ to a recipient named by those authorized to make the donation.

        (i)  A justifiable deficit is one in which the facility did not meet its annual compliance level due to either financial inability (as determined under § 124.511(c)) or, although otherwise in compliance with this subpart, a lack of eligible applicants for uncompensated services during the fiscal year.

        (ii)  A noncompliance deficit is one in which the facility failed to meet its annual compliance level due to noncompliance with this subpart.

        (2) —(i)  (A) A facility assisted under title VI of the Act may make up a justifiable deficit at any time during its period of obligation or in the year (or years, if necessary) immediately following its period of obligation.

        (B) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act is not required to make up a justifiable deficit.

        (ii)  (A) A facility must begin to make up a noncompliance deficit in the fiscal year following the finding of noncompliance by the Secretary.

        (B) A facility which claimed financial inability under § 124.509(a)(2)(iii) and is found by the Secretary, pursuant to § 124.511(c), to have been financially able to provide uncompensated services in the year in which the deficit was incurred shall begin to make up the deficit beginning in the fiscal year following the Secretary's finding.

        (C) A facility required to make up a noncompliance deficit but which is determined by the Secretary, pursuant to § 124.511(c), to be financially unable to do so in the year following the Secretary's finding of noncompliance shall make up the deficit in accordance with a schedule set by the Secretary.

        (3)  (i) The amount of a deficit in any fiscal year is the difference between the facility's annual compliance level for that year and the amount of uncompensated services provided in that year.

        (ii) The amount of a justifiable deficit must be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the deficit was incurred and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which it was made up.

        (iii) An amount equal to the result of dividing the amount of any noncompliance deficit for a fiscal year by the number of years of obligation remaining and adjusting it by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the deficit was incurred and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which it was made up shall be added to a facility's annual compliance level for each fiscal year following the fiscal year of the finding of noncompliance.

        (4)  Except where a facility reports to the Secretary in accordance with § 124.509(a)(2)(iii) that it was financially unable to provide uncompensated services at the annual compliance level, a facility that fails to meet its annual compliance level in any fiscal year shall, in the following year, develop and implement a plan of action that can reasonably be expected to enable the facility to meet its annual compliance level. Such actions may include special notice to the community through newspaper, radio, and television, or expansion of service to Category B, or, with respect to nursing homes, Category C, persons. The Secretary may require changes to the plan. Where a facility fails to comply with this section, the Secretary may require it to make up the deficit in the fiscal year following the year in which it was required to institute the plan.

        (c)  (1) Except for facilities certified under § 124.513, § 124.514, § 124.515, § 124.516, or § 124.517, if a facility provides in a fiscal year uncompensated services in an amount exceeding its annual compliance level, it may apply the amount of excess to reduce its annual compliance level in any subsequent fiscal year. The facility may use any excess amount to reduce its annual compliance level only if the services in excess of the annual compliance level are provided in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

        (2)  (i) The amount of an excess in uncompensated services in any fiscal year is the difference between the amount of uncompensated services the facility provided in that year and the facility's annual compliance level for that year.

        (ii) The amount of any excess compliance applied to reduce a facility's annual compliance level must be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility provided the excess, and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility applies the excess to reduce its annual compliance level or satisfy its remaining obligation.

        (3) Except as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a facility assisted under title VI may in any fiscal year apply the amount of excess credited under this paragraph to satisfy the remainder of its obligation to provide uncompensated services. A facility's remaining obligation is determined as follows:

        (i) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the remaining obligation is:

        (A) For grant assistance, 10 percent of each grant under obligation, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, adjusted as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, plus any deficits required to be made up and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; and

        (B) For loan assistance, the facility's annual compliance level multiplied by the number of years remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus the sum of 10 percent of each yearly cumulative total of additional interest subsidy or other payments (which the Secretary will have made in connection with the guaranteed loan or a direct loan which has been sold) in each subsequent year remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus any deficits required to be made up, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; or

        (ii) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining obligation is the average of the facility's annual compliance levels in the previous three years, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, plus any deficits required to be made up under this section, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years.

        (2) The amount of uncompensated services the facility intends to make available in the fiscal year or a statement that the facility will provide uncompensated services to all persons unable to pay who request uncompensated services;

        (3) An explanation, if the amount of uncompensated services the facility intends to make available in a fiscal year is less than the annual compliance level.

        (b)  (1) The facility shall post notices, which the Secretary supplies in English and Spanish, in appropriate areas in the facility, including but not limited to the admissions areas, the business office, and the emergency room.

        (2) If in the service area of the facility the “usual language of households” of ten percent or more of the population according to the most recent figures published by the Bureau of the Census is other than English or Spanish, the facility shall translate the notice into that language and post the translated notice on signs substantially similar in size and legibility to and posted with those supplied under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (3) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the contents of the posted notice to persons who it has reason to believe cannot read the notice.

        (c)  (1) In any period during a fiscal year in which uncompensated services are available in the facility, the facility shall provide individual written notice of the availability of uncompensated services to each person who seeks services in the facility on behalf of himself or another. The individual written notice must:

        (i) State that the facility is required by law to provide a reasonable amount of care without or below charge to people who cannot afford care;

        (iv) State that the facility will make a written determination of whether the person will receive uncompensated services, and the date by or period within which the determination will be made.

        (2) The facility shall provide the individual written notice before providing services, except where the emergency nature of the services provided makes prior notice impractical. If this exception applies, the facility shall provide the individual written notice to the next of kin or to the patient as soon as practical, but not later than when first presenting a bill for services.

        (3) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the contents of the individual written notice to persons who it has reason to believe cannot read the notice.

        § 124.511   Investigation and determination of compliance.

#### § § 124.511

        (a)  A complaint that a facility is out of compliance with the requirements of this subpart may be filed with the Secretary by any person.

        (1) A complaint is considered to be filed with the Secretary on the date the following information is received in the Office of the HHS Regional Health Administrator for the Region in which the facility is located:

        (i) The name and address of the person making the complaint or on whose behalf the complaint is made;

        (ii) The name and location of the facility;

        (iii) The date or approximate date on which the event occurred; and

        (iv) A statement of what actions the complainant considers to violate the requirements of this subpart.

        (2) The Secretary promptly provides a copy of the complaint to the facility named in the complaint.

        (3) When the Secretary investigates a facility, the facility, including a facility certified under § 124.513, § 124.514, § 124.515, § 124.516, or § 124.517, shall provide to the Secretary on request any documents, records and other information concerning its operation that relate to the requirements of this subpart. A facility will be presumed to be out of compliance with its assurance unless it supplies documentation sufficient to show compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart.

        (4) Section 1627 of the Act provides that if the Secretary dimisses a complaint or the Attorney General has not brought an action for compliance within six months from the date on which the compliant is filed, the person filing it may bring a private action to effectuate compliance with the assurance. If the Secretary determines that he/she will be unable to issue a decision on a complaint or otherwise take appropriate action within the six month period, the Secretary may, based on priorities for the disposition of complaints that are established to promote the most effective use of enforcement resources, or on the request of the applicant, dismiss the complaint without a finding as to compliance prior to the end of the six month period, but no earlier than 45 days after the complaint is filed.

        (b)  The Secretary periodically investigates and assesses facilities to ascertain compliance with the requirements of this subpart, including certification of the amount of uncompensated services provided in a fiscal year or years, and provides guidance and prescribes corrective action to correct noncompliance.

        (1)  (i) The Secretary may certify that a facility has substantially complied with its assurance for a fiscal year or years, and such certification shall establish that the facility provided the amount of uncompensated services certified for the period covered by the certification.

        (ii) A certification of substantial compliance shall be based on the amount properly claimed by the facility pursuant to § 124.509(a), utilizing procedures determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to establish that the facility has substantially complied with its assurance for the period covered by the certification. The procedures will include examination of individual account data to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary.

        (iii) A certification of substantial compliance will be made where the Secretary determines that, for the period covered by the certification, the facility provided uncompensated services to eligible persons who had equal opportunity to apply therefor. In making this determination, the Secretary will consider, in descending order of importance, whether—

        § 124.513   Public facility compliance alternative.

#### § § 124.513

        (a)  The Secretary may certify a facility which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as a “public facility”. A facility which is so certified is not required to comply with this subpart except as otherwise herein provided.

        (b)  A public facility may qualify for certification under this section if all of the following criteria are met:

        (1) It is a facility which is owned and operated by a unit of State or local government or a quasi-public corporation as defined at 42 CFR 124.2(m).

        (2) It provides health services without charge or at a substantially reduced rate to persons who are determined by the facility to qualify therefor under a program of discounted health services. A “program of discounted health services” must provide for financial and other objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to nonemergency service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility for such services, including a determination prior to service where requested;  such criteria and procedures are not required where the facility makes all services available to all persons at no or nominal charge.

        (3)(i) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue (net patient revenue plus other operating revenue, exclusive of any amounts received, or if not received, claimed, as reimbursement under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act) from State and local tax appropriations or other State and local government revenues, or from a quasi-public corporation as defined at 42 CFR 124.2(m), to cover operating deficits attributable to the provision of discounted services; or

        (ii) If provided, in each of the three most recent fiscal years, uncompensated services under this subpart or under programs described by the documentation provided under § 124.513(c)(2) in an amount not less than twice the annual compliance level computed under § 124.503(a).

        (c)  To be certified under this section, a facility must submit to the Secretary, in addition to other materials that the Secretary may from time to time require, copies of the following:

        (1) Audited financial statements or official State or local government documents (such as annual reports or budget documents), for the three most recent fiscal years, sufficient to show that the facility meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

        (2) A complete description of its program(s) of discounted health services, including charging and collection policies of the facility, and eligibility criteria and notice and determination procedures used under its program(s) of discounted services.

        (d)  (1) A certification by the Secretary under this section remains in effect until withdrawn. The Secretary may disallow credit under this subpart when the Secretary determines that there has been a material change in any factor upon which certification was based or substantial noncompliance with this subpart. The Secretary may withdraw certification where the change or noncompliance has not been adequately remedied or otherwise continues.

        (2) —(i)  Where a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has been assessed as having a deficit under § 124.503(b) that has not been made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make up that deficit by either—

        (A) Demonstrating to the Secretary's satisfaction, that it met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for each year in which a deficit was assessed; or

        (B) Providing an additional period of service under this section on the basis of one (or portion of a) year of certification for each year (or portion of a year) of deficit assessed. The period of obligation applicable to the facility under § 124.501(b) shall be extended until the deficit is made up in accordance with the preceding sentence.

        (ii)  Where any period of compliance under this subpart of a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has not been assessed, the facility will be presumed to have no allowable credit for such period. The facility may either—

        (A) Make up such deficit in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; or

        (B) Submit an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records maintained pursuant to § 124.510. If the audit establishes to the Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (iii)  (A) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act which has an assessed deficit which was not made up prior to certification under this section shall make up that deficit in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section. If it cannot make the showing required by that paragraph, it shall make up the deficit when its certification under this section is withdrawn.

        (B) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act whose compliance with this subpart has not been completely assessed will be presumed to have no allowable credit for the unassessed period. The facility may make up the deficit by—

        () Following the procedure of subparagraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section; or

        () Submitting an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records maintained pursuant to § 1_2_4.510. If the audit establishes to the Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.

        (1)(i) Title VI-assisted facilities. (A) For the facility's fiscal year in which this section becomes effective, the level, computed under § 124.503(c) (3), divided by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation (including an additional year or portion of a year for each year or portion of a year in which a deficit was incurred and has not been made up), is not more than $10,000;

        (B) For a subsequent fiscal year, the level computed under paragraph (A) of this paragraph (b)(1)(i), is at or less than $10,000, adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI available in the year in which this section becomes effective and the most recent year for which a published index is available.

        (ii)  (A) For the facility's fiscal year in which this section becomes effective, the level under § 124.503(a), plus the amount of any noncompliance deficits which have not been made up, is at or less than $10,000.

        (B) For a subsequent fiscal year, the level, computed under paragraph (A) of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), is at or less than $10,000, adjusted as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

        (2) It provides health services without charge or at a substantially reduced rate to persons who are determined by the facility to qualify threrefor under a program of discounted health services. A “program of discounted health services” must provide for financial and other objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to nonemergency service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility for such services, including a determination prior to service where requested;  such criteria and procedures are not required where the facility makes all services available to all persons at no or nominal charge.

        (d)  A certification by the Secretary under this section remains in effect until withdrawn. During the period in which such certification is in effect, the facility must provide uncompensated services in an amount not less than the level applicable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for each fiscal year. The Secretary may disallow credit under this subpart when the Secretary determines that there has been a material change in any factor upon which certification was based or substantial noncompliance with this subpart. The Secretary may withdraw certification where the change or noncompliance cannot be or has not been adequately remedied or noncompliance otherwise continues.

        (e)  (1) Where the compliance level of a facility assisted under title VI of the Act is computed under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section as including additional year(s) or a portion of a year, the facility's period of obligation under this subpart shall be extended by such additional period, until certification is withdrawn.

        (2) Where a facility has been assessed as having a deficit under § 124.503(b) that has not been made up prior to withdrawal of certification under this section or fails to provide services as required by paragraph (d) of this section, the facility must make up the deficit in accordance with § 124.503(b) following withdrawal of certification.

        § 124.517   Unrestricted availability compliance alternative for Title VI-assisted facilities.

#### § § 124.517

        (a)  The Secretary may certify a Title VI-assisted facility which meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and the applicable requirements of this subpart as an unrestricted availability facility. A facility which is so certified is not required to comply with the requirements of this subpart, except as provided in this section or elsewhere in this subpart.

        (b)  A facility may qualify for certification under this section if, for any fiscal year for which certification is sought, it operates a compliant, fully expanded uncompensated services program. Such a program must meet the following criteria:

        (1) It makes all services of the facility available without charge to all persons requesting uncompensated services from the facility who are eligible under § 124.505, including all persons coming within Category B and, if applicable, Category C.

        (2) It complies with the notice and allocation plan requirements of §§ 124.504 and 124.506, except that all notices published or provided must describe an allocation plan and program consistent with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (3) It makes written determinations in accordance with § 124.507, except that all favorable determinations must indicate that the facility will provide uncompensated services at no charge.

        (4) It provides uncompensated services consistent with the requirements of this section for the entire fiscal year for which certification is sought, except that a facility may

        (i) Cease providing such services and still receive credit, calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, where—

        (A) The facility has completed its total uncompensated services obligation, including making up any deficit; or

        (B) The facility determines, and submits documentation which the Secretary finds, taking into account the factors identified in § 124.511(c), sufficient to establish that it is financially unable to continue to meet the requirements of this section for the remainder of the fiscal year; and

        (ii) Receive a portion of a year's credit for the first partial year in which it began operating a fully expanded program, as long as it continued to operate the fully expanded program in subsequent years.

        (c)  A certification by the Secretary under this section remains in effect until withdrawn. The Secretary may withdraw certification under this section where the Secretary determines the facility is in substantial noncompliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and has not adequately remedied or otherwise continues such noncompliance. Where the Secretary withdraws certification for part or all of a fiscal year or years, no credit may be granted for the period of unremedied substantial noncompliance.

        (d)  (1) Where a Title VI-assisted facility has been assessed as having a deficit under § 124.503(b) that has not been made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make up the deficit by providing uncompensated services in accordance with this section. The facility shall receive credit towards its deficit on the basis of one year, or part thereof, of credit towards each “deficit year” for each year, or part thereof, of operation in compliance with this section and the applicable requirements of this subpart.

        (2) The number of “deficit years” of a facility shall be calculated as follows:

        (i) Determine the number of years in the facility's total period of obligation pursuant to § 124.501;

        (ii) Subtract the number of years in which the facility operated in compliance with this section and the applicable requirements of this subpart from the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;

        (iii) For all years in which the facility did not operate in compliance with this section, determine the ratio of the total compliance levels applicable under § 124.503(a) to the facility's total deficit under § 124.503(b);

        (iv) Multiply the percentage derived under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section by the number of years under obligation pursuant to § 124.501 but for which the facility did not operate in compliance with this section;

        (v) Subtract the number derived under paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section from the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;

        (vi) If the facility is still within the period described in § 124.501(b)(1), add the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section to the end of the period of obligation, or if the facility is beyond the period described in § 124.501(b)(1), add the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section to the last year the facility operated in compliance with this section.

        § 124.603   Provision of services.

#### § § 124.603

        (a)  (1) In order to comply with its community service assurance, a facility shall make the services provided in the facility or portion thereof constructed, modernized, or converted with Federal assistance under title VI or XVI of the Act available to all persons residing (and, in the case of facilities assisted under title XVI of the Act, employed) in the facility's service area without discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, creed, or any other ground unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the availability of the needed service in the facility. Subject to paragraph (b) (concerning emergency services) a facility may deny services to persons who are unable to pay for them unless those persons are required to be provided uncompensated services under the provisions of Subpart F.

        (2) A person is residing in the facility's service area for purposes of this section if the person:

        (i) Is living in the service area with the intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period;

        (ii) Is living in the service area for purposes of employment; or

        (iii) Is living with a family member who resides in the service area.

        (b)  (1) A facility may not deny emergency services to any person who resides (or, in the case of facilities assisted under title XVI of the Act, is employed) in the facility's service area on the ground that the person is unable to pay for those services.

        (2) A facility may discharge a person that has received emergency services, or may transfer the person to another facility able to provide necessary services, when the appropriate medical personnel determine that discharge or transfer will not subject the person to a substantial risk of deterioration in medical condition.

        (c)  (1) The facility shall make arrangements, if eligible to do so, for reimbursement for services with:

        (i) Those principal State and local governmental third-party payors that provide reimbursement for services that is not less than the actual costs, as determined in accordance with accepted cost accounting principles; and

        (ii) Federal governmental third-party programs, such as medicare and medicaid.

        (2) The facility shall take any necessary steps to insure that admission to and services of the facility are available to beneficiaries of the governmental programs specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section without discrimination or preference because they are beneficiaries of those programs.

        (d)  A facility is out of compliance with its community service assurance if it uses an admission policy that has the effect of excluding persons on a ground other than those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section. Illustrative applications of this requirement are described in the following paragraphs:

        (1) A facility has a policy or practice of admitting only those patients who are referred by physicians with staff privileges at the facility. If this policy or practice has the effect of excluding persons who reside (or for title XVI facilities, are employed) in the community from the facility because they do not have a private family doctor with staff privileges at the facility, the facility would not be in compliance with its assurance. The facility is not required to abolish its staff physician admissions policy as a usual method for admission. However, to be in compliance with its community service assurance it must make alternative arrangements to assist area residents who would otherwise be unable to gain admission to obtain services available in the facility. Examples of alternative arrangements a facility might use include:

        (i) Authorizing the individual's physician, if licensed and otherwise qualified, to treat the patient at the facility even though the physician does not have staff privileges at the facility;

        (ii) For those patients who have no physician, obtaining the voluntary agreement of physicians with staff privileges at the facility to accept referrals of such patients, perhaps on a rotating basis;

        (iii) If an insufficient number of physicians with staff privileges agree to participate in a referral arrangement, requiring acceptance of referrals as a condition to obtaining or renewing staff privileges;

        (iv) Establishing a hospital-based primary care clinic through which patients needing hospitalization may be admitted; or

        (v) Hiring or contracting with qualified physicians to treat patients who do not have private physicians.

        (2) A facility, as required, is a qualified provider under the title XIX medicaid program, but few or none of the physicians with staff privileges at the facility or in a particular department or sub-department of the facility will treat medicaid patients. If the effect is that some medicaid patients are excluded from the facility or from any service provided in the facility, the facility is not in compliance with its community service assurance. To be in compliance a facility does not have to require all of its staff physicians to accept medicaid. However, it must take steps to ensure that medicaid beneficiaries have full access to all of its available services. Examples of steps that may be taken include:

        (i) Obtaining the voluntary agreement of a reasonable number of physicians with staff privileges at the facility and in each department or sub-department to accept referral of medicaid patients, perhaps on a rotating basis;

        (ii) If an insufficient number of physicians with staff privileges agree to participate in a referral arrangement, requiring acceptance of referrals as a condition to obtaining or renewing staff privileges;

        (iii) Establishing a clinic through which medicaid beneficiaries needing hospitalization may be admitted; or

        (iv) Hiring or contracting with physicians to treat medicaid patients.

        (3) A facility requires advance deposits (pre-admission or pre-service deposits) before admitting or serving patients. If the effect of this practice is that some persons are denied admission or service or face substantial delays in gaining admission or service solely because they do not have the necessary cash on hand, this would constitute a violation of the community service assurance. While the facility is not required to forego the use of a deposit policy in all situations, it is required to make alternative arrangements to ensure that persons who probably can pay for the services are not denied them simply because they do not have the available cash at the time services are requested. For example, many employed persons and persons with other collateral do not have savings, but can pay hospital bills on an installment basis, or can pay a small deposit. Such persons may not be excluded from admission or denied services because of their inability to pay a deposit.

        § 124.604   Posted notice.

#### § § 124.604

        (a) The facility shall post notices, which the Secretary supplies in English and Spanish, in appropriate areas of the facility, including but not limited to the admissions area, the business office and the emergency room.

        (b) If in the service area of the facility the “usual language of households” of ten percent or more of the population, according to the most recent figures published by the Bureau of the Census, is other than English or Spanish, the facility shall translate the notice into that language and post the translated notice on signs substantially similar in size and legibility to, and posted with, those supplied under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the contents of the posted notice to persons who it has reason to believe cannot read the notice.

        § 124.605   Reporting and record maintenance requirements.

#### § § 124.605

        (a) —(1)  (i) A facility shall submit to the Secretary a report to assist the Secretary in determining compliance with this subpart once every three fiscal years, on a schedule to be prescribed by the Secretary. The report required by this section shall be submitted not later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year, unless a longer period is approved by the Secretary for good cause shown.

        (ii) A facility shall also submit the required report whenever the Secretary determines, and so notifies the facility in writing, that a report is needed for proper administration of the program. In this situation the facility shall submit the report specified in this section for the filing of reports, within 90 days after receiving notice from the Secretary, or within 90 days after the close of the fiscal year, whichever is later.

        (2)  The report must be submitted on a form prescribed by the Secretary and must include information that the Secretary prescribes to permit a determination of whether a facility has met its obligations under this subpart.

        (3) The facility shall provide a copy of any report to the HSA for the area when submitting it to the Secretary.

        (4)  Not later than 10 days after being served with a summons or complaint, the applicant shall notify the Regional Health Administrator for the Region of HHS in which it is located of any legal action brought against it alleging that it has failed to comply with the requirements of this subpart.

        (b)  (1) A facility shall maintain, make available for public inspection consistent with personal privacy, and provide to the Secretary on request, any records necessary to document its compliance requirements of this subpart in any fiscal year, including documents from which information required to be reported under paragraph (a) of this section was obtained. A facility shall maintain these records until 180 days following the close of the Secretary's investigation under § 124.606(a).

        § 124.606   Investigation and enforcement.

#### § § 124.606

        (a)  (1) The Secretary periodically investigates the compliance of facilities with the requirements of this subpart, and investigates complaints.

        (2)(i) A complaint is filed with the Secretary on the date on which the following information is received in the Office of the Regional Health Administrator for the Region of HHS in which the facility is located:

        (A) The name and address of the person making the complaint or on whose behalf the complaint is made;

        (B) The name and location of the facility;

        (C) The date or approximate date on which the event complained of occurred, and

        (D) A statement of what actions the complainant considers to violate the requirements of this subpart.

        (ii) The Secretary promptly provides a copy of the complaint to each facility named in the complaint.

        (3) When the Secretary investigates a facility, the facility shall provide to the Secretary on request any documents, records and other information concerning its operations that relate to the requirements of this subpart.

        (4) The Act provides that if the Secretary dismisses a complaint or the Attorney General has not brought an action for compliance within six months from the date on which the complaint is filed, the person filing it may bring a private action to effectuate compliance with the assurance. If the Secretary determines that he will be unable to issue a decision on a complaint or otherwise take appropriate action within the six month period, he may, based on priorities for the disposition of complaints that are established to promote the most effective use of enforcement resources, or on the request of the complainant, dismiss the complaint without a finding as to compliance prior to the end of the six month period, but no earlier than 45 days after the complaint is filed.

        (b)  (1) If the Secretary finds, based on his investigation under paragraph (a) of this section, that a facility did not comply with the requirements of this subpart, he may take any action authorized by law to secure compliance, including but not limited to voluntary agreement or a request to the Attorney General to bring an action against the facility for specific performance.

        (2) If the Secretary finds, based on his investigation under paragraph (a) of this section, that a facility has limited the availability of its services in a manner proscribed by this subpart, he may, in addition to any other action that he is authorized to take in accordance with the Act, require the facility to establish an effective affirmative action plan that in his judgment is designed to insure that its services are made available in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

        § 124.607   Agreements with State agencies.

#### § § 124.607

        (a) Where the Secretary finds that it will promote the purposes of this subpart, and the State agency is able and willing to do so, he may enter into an agreement with the State agency for the State agency to assist him in administering this subpart in the State.

        (b) Under an agreement, the State agency will provide the Secretary with any assistance he requests in any one or more of the following areas, as set out in the agreement:

        (1) Investigation of complaints of noncompliance;

        (2) Monitoring the compliance of facilities with the requirements of this subpart;

        (3) Review of affirmative action plans submitted under § 124.606(b);

        (4) Review of reports submitted under § 124.605;

        (5) Making initial decisions for the Secretary with respect to compliance, subject to appeal by any party to the Secretary or review by the Secretary on his own initiative; and

        (6) Application of any sanctions available to it under State law (such as license revocation or termination of State assistance) against facilities determined to be out of compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

        (c) A State agency may use funds received under section 1525 of the Act to pay for expenses incurred in the course of carrying out this agreement.

        (d) Nothing in this subpart precludes any State from taking any action authorized by State law regarding the provision of services by any facility in the State as long as the action taken does not prevent the Secretary from enforcing the requirements of this subpart.

        (a) If any facility is at any time within 20 years after the completion of the grant-assisted construction or modernization sold or transferred to any entity which is either not qualified for a grant under the statute pursuant to which the grant was awarded or not approved as a transferee by the State agency, the United States shall be entitled to recover on the basis of joint and several liability from any transferor, transferee, or successive transferee of the facility an amount determined in accordance with this subpart.

        (b) If any facility at any time within 20 years after the completion of the grant-assisted construction or modernization ceases to be a public or other non-profit facility that would have been eligible for a grant under the statute pursuant to which the grant was awarded, the United States shall be entitled to recover from the owners of the facility an amount determined in accordance with this subpart.

        § 124.704   Notification of sale, transfer, or change of use.

#### § § 124.704

        (a) The transferor of a facility that is sold or transferred as described in § 124.703(a), or the owner of a facility which ceases to be a public or other nonprofit facility as described in § 124.703(b), shall provide the Secretary written notice of such sale, transfer, or other change not later than 10 days after the date on which the sale, transfer, or change occurs.

        (1)  For purposes of this subpart, a transfer occurs when a facility is conveyed to another entity through lease, merger, bankruptcy, foreclosure, or other arrangement.

        (2)  For purposes of this subpart,

        (i) A facility “ceases to be” a facility for which a grant could have been made under the statute pursuant to which the grant was awarded when it is no longer operated as such a facility; and

        (ii) A facility “ceases to be a public or nonprofit facility” when an entity that is not a public or other non-profit corporation or association assumes management responsibilities with respect to the facility which, in the Secretary's judgment, are so pervasive as to constitute operation of the facility. The manager will not be deemed to be the operator of the facility if the management agreement contains both of the following provisions:

        (b)  The notice required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be sent to the Secretary by certified mail, and shall contain or be accompanied by

        (1) The date of the sale, transfer, or other event that gives rise to the notice;

        (2) Copies of any sales contracts, lease agreements, management contracts or other documents pertinent to the event giving rise to the notice;

        (3) Estimates of current assets, current liabilities, book value of equipment, the expected value of land on the new owner's books, and the remaining depreciation for all fixed assets involved in the transaction calculated on a straight line basis using commonly adopted expected useful lifetimes.

        (c)  Failure to provide the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, will be considered failure to provide the notice required by this section. In any case in which such information has not been provided, the Secretary will, promptly upon receiving an incomplete notice or otherwise discovering that a sale, transfer or other event giving rise to a recovery may have occurred, send a letter to the owner of the facility requesting the information needed to calculate a recovery amount.

        § 124.705   Amount of recovery.

#### § § 124.705

        (a) Except as provided in § 124.706, the amount that the United States shall be entitled to recover under this subpart is that amount bearing the same ratio to the then value of so much of the facility as constituted an approved project (or projects) as the amount of Federal participation bore to the cost of the construction or modernization under such project (or projects).

        (b) The then value of the facility will be based on:

        (1) The transaction value in the case of an arms-length sale or transfer, or

        (2) A depreciated reproduction value in the absence of an arms-length sale or transfer or if the buyer fails to provide, within 60 days after the date of the Secretary's letter described in § 124.704(c), the information which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is necessary to establish, adjust, and apportion a transaction value. As used in this section, “transaction value” means in the case of a sale, the sale price, and in the case of a lease, the value of the lease plus the residual value of the facility at the termination of the lease (i.e., the reproduction value or, if appropriate, an alternative use value).

        (c) The transaction value will be adjusted to account for the purchase or lease of other assets and the assumption of liabilities associated with the transaction. To determine the amount of Federal recovery, the adjusted value will be apportioned to the grant-aided assets by the ration of the remaining useful lifetime values of those assets to the sum of the remaining useful lifetime values of all assets not previously accounted for in adjusting the transaction value.

        (d) A depreciated reproduction value will be established by calculating a reproduction value using construction cost indexes or current costs per square foot for construction, depending on which is more relevant to the type of construction associated with the grant. This reproduction value will then be adjusted by the ratio of the remaining useful life to the total useful life for the assets involved.

        (e) In calculating the recovery amount, the Secretary will include as Federal participation any grant assistance received by the facility under an authority listed in § 124.701 and any assistance supplementary to that assistance received for the construction or modernization of the facility under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121, ) or the Local Public Works Capital Development Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-369).

        § 124.706   Calculation of interest.

#### § § 124.706

        (a) In addition to the amount of recovery calculated under § 124.705, the United States shall be entitled to recover interest on such amount in accordance with this section at the rate determined by the Secretary based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly ninety-day U.S. Treasury bill auction rate for the quarter previous to the quarter in which interest begins to accrue under this section.

        (1)  For facilities that were sold or transferred or which ceased to be public or other nonprofit facilities before July 18, 1984, interest will be charged beginning August 17, 1984, or 180 days after the date of such sale, transfer or other, whichever is later, and ending on the date the amount the United States is entitled to recover is collected.

        (2)  For facilities that are sold or transferred or which cease to be public or other nonprofit facilities after July 17, 1984, interest will be charged beginning 180 days after receipt by the Department of the notice required under § 124.704;  That if such notice is not provided as prescribed, interest will be charged beginning on the date of the sale, transfer, or change of use, and ending on the date the amount which the United States is entitled to recover is collected.

        (b) The Secretary may waive interest charges that result from delays caused solely by the Department.

        § 124.707   Waiver of recovery where facility is sold or transferred to a proprietary entity.

#### § § 124.707

        (a)  The Secretary may waive the recovery rights of the United States arising under § 124.703(a) if the entity to which the facility was sold or transferred:

        (1) Has filed a written request for the waiver within the time limits prescribed by this section;

        (2) Has established an irrevocable trust in accordance with this section, in an amount equal to the greater of the amount that would otherwise have been recovered pursuant to § 124.705 (including accrued interest as calculated under § 124.706) or twice the cost of the remaining uncompensated services obligation of the facility as of the date of the change of status, that will be used by the entity only to provide services to those unable to pay in accordance with the requirements of subpart F of this part; and

        (3) Has agreed to comply with the community service regulations set out in subpart G of this part.

        (b)  (1) Within 30 days after the date of receipt of the information described in § 124.704(b), the Secretary will send a letter to the new owner of the facility advising of the United States' right of recovery and the opportunity to obtain a waiver. For the purpose of advising the new owner of the amount to be placed in the irrevocable trust should the owner wish to obtain a waiver, the letter will also state the dollar amount of the remaining uncompensated care obligation and the amount that would be due under § 124.705, computed as follows:

        (i)  (A) For a facility which changes status before the date that subpart F of this part is effective for the facility, the remaining uncompensated services obligation is zero.

        (B) For a facility which changes status after the date that subpart F of this part is effective for the facility, the Secretary will multiply the annual compliance level, computed under the 10% method specified in 42 CFR 124.503(a)(1)(ii), for the fiscal year in which the change of status occurs times the number of years remaining in the facility's uncompensated services obligation. From this amount, the Secretary will subtract amounts of excess or add amounts of deficit for each fiscal year prior to the change of status for which the Secretary has previously conducted an audit of uncompensated services accounts. Excess and deficits will be adjusted by the percent change in the National Consumer Price Index for Medical Care between the year in which the excess or deficit occurred and the year in which the status change occurred. For each fiscal year prior to the change of status which the Secretary has _not_ audited, the Secretary will add to the remaining obligation an amount equal to the annual compliance level in each such year adjusted by the percent change in the National Consumer Price Index for Medical Care between that year and the year of the status change. The amount computed as the total remaining obligation will then be multiplied by two. If the transferee chooses to accept the Secretary's calculation, no further assessments will be made of uncompensated care provided prior to the change of status date. If the transferee does not accept the calculation, the transferor or transferee may hire, and may charge against the irrevocable trust established under this section, an independent auditor to certify the compliance level and any excess or deficit for the period from May 18, 1979, up to and including the date of the change of status, using standard Departmental procedures supplemented with instructions provided by the Secretary, and submit the results in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The audit may be conducted for any years  included in a previous site assessment conducted by the Department. If the Secretary agrees that a change is appropriate, the Secretary will use this information to adjust the calculation as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If the independent auditor certifies that qualified care was rendered either at the facility or at a replacement facility operated by the transferee between the date of the change of status and the date of establishment of the trust, and the Secretary agrees, the post transfer level of care shall not affect the calculation of the total remaining uncompensated care obligation to be doubled, but instead shall be recognized as a credit to be drawn from the trust as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In the case of a facility with respect to which a grant was made under title XVI of the Act, the remaining period of obligation will be the remainder of the expected useful life of the facility, as follows: 40 years for buildings, 30 years for additions, 20 years for building renovations, 20 years for fixed equipment and 12 years for major movable equipment.

        (ii)  The Secretary will determine the recovery amount as provided in § 124.705.

        (2) Within 60 days following the date of the Secretary's letter provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner of the facility shall notify the Secretary in writing that it either:

        (i) Accepts the trust fund amount for the waiver as offered by the Secretary;

        (ii) Provides a detailed statement of an alternative determination of the recovery amount or an independent audit of the remaining uncompensated services obligation as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or

        (iii) Does not seek a waiver under § 124.707. Failure to provide a timely response to the Secretary under this subparagraph will be considered an election not to seek the waiver.

        (3) Within 30 days following the receipt of the owner's views concerning the calculation, and after considering those views, the Secretary will send a final letter providing the Secretary's determination of twice the remaining uncompensated care obligation and the recovery amount under § 124.705. The amount to be placed in the irrevocable trust will be the higher of those two figures. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)

        (4) Within 30 days of the date of the final letter, the owner of the facility shall notify the Secretary in writing whether or not it accepts the terms of the waiver. Failure to provide timely notice to the Secretary under this subparagraph will be considered an election not to accept the waiver.

        (c)  (1) Within 60 days of the date of its acceptance of a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this section, the owner shall begin delivering services to those unable to pay in accordance with subpart F of this part under an irrevocable trust established in the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.  That

        (i) The owner shall provide a copy of the trust documents to the Secretary and no trust shall be considered established until the trust documents have been approved by the Secretary; and

        (ii) The owner may credit against the trust any uncompensated services provided in accordance with subpart F of this part between the date of the change of status of the facility and the establishment of the trust. For an owner to receive the credit before the establishment of the trust and deposit of funds therein, the auditor's report covering the post-transfer period shall be submitted with the notification of acceptance of the waiver, and in any event, not later than 30 days from the date of the Secretary's final letter described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Within 30 days following the receipt of the auditor's report, the Secretary will notify the owner of the allowable credit, if any. If the auditor's report is not timely submitted, the trust must be established and fully funded, in accordance with the time limits imposed by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the Secretary will notify the owner of the allowable credit, if any, within 30 days of the date of the establishment of the trust or within 30 days of the receipt of the report, whichever is later.

        (2) The trust shall be administered by a Trustee who is neither an employee of the transferee nor an employee of a subsidiary or of the parent institution of the transferee.

        (3) The trust shall provide that the trust corpus and income may be invested only in U.S. Government or U.S. Government insured securities.

        (d)  The corpus and income of the irrevocable trust shall be used to pay for the costs of uncompensated services, which may include reasonable costs of establishing and administering the trust and the cost of the independent audit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, until the trust is exhausted.

        § 124.708   Waiver of recovery—good cause for other use of facility.

#### § § 124.708

        The Secretary may for good cause waive the recovery rights of the United States arising under § 124.703(b). In determining whether there is good cause under this section for releasing the applicant or other owner of the facility from its obligation, the Secretary will take into consideration the extent to which:

        (a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to use for another public or nonprofit purpose whch will promote the purpose of the Act;

        (b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of the 20-year period other public or nonprofit facilities not previously utilized for the purpose for which the facility was constructed will be so utilized and are substantially equivalent in nature and purpose.

        (c) The facility has been acquired from an agency of the United States (e.g., the Federal Housing Administration under its mortgage insurance commitment program) which has made a reasonable effort to dispose of it for operation as a public or nonprofit health care facility.

        (b) The Secretary will monitor compliance with the community service and uncompensated care obligations of any entity that receives a waiver.

        (c) Should a recipient of a waiver fail to comply with the applicable conditions, the Secretary will withdraw the waiver and seek recovery based on the value of the facility on the date the right of recovery first arose under § 124.703.

        (d) No waiver will be withdrawn until the recipient has been notified in writing by the Secretary of the noncompliance and has failed to take corrective action within 90 days after the date of such notice.

        (e) Should the waiver be withdrawn, the amount of the Government's recovery will be the amount set out in the Secretary's determination letter as described in § 124.707 (b)(1) or (b)(3) as applicable plus interest from the date of the notification sent in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      Subpart D—Limitation on Charges for Services Furnished by Medicare-Participating Hospitals to Indians

**Source:** Source: 72 FR 30710, June 4, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

        § 136.30   Payment to Medicare-participating hospitals for authorized Contract Health Services.

#### § § 136.30

        (a)  All Medicare-participating hospitals, which are defined for purposes of this subpart to include all departments and provider-based facilities of hospitals (as defined in sections 1861(e) and (f) of the Social Security Act) and critical access hospitals (as defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Social Security Act), that furnish inpatient services must accept no more than the rates of payment under the methodology described in this section as payment in full for all items and services authorized by IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian organization entities, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  The payment methodology under this section applies to all levels of care furnished by a Medicare-participating hospital, whether provided as inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility care, as other services of a department, subunit, distinct part, or other component of a hospital (including services furnished directly by the hospital or under arrangements) that is authorized under part 136, subpart C by a contract health service (CHS) program of the Indian Health Service (IHS); or authorized by a Tribe or Tribal organization carrying out a CHS program of the IHS under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, Pub. L. 93-638, 25 U.S.C. 450  or authorized for purchase under § 136.31 by an urban Indian organization (as that term is defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(h)) (hereafter “I/T/U”).

        (c)  (1) Payment for hospital services that the Medicare program would pay under a prospective payment system (PPS) will be based on that PPS. For example, payment for inpatient hospital services shall be made per discharge based on the applicable PPS used by the Medicare program to pay for similar hospital services under 42 CFR part 412. Payment for outpatient hospital services shall be made based on a PPS used in the Medicare program to pay for similar hospital services under 42 CFR part 419. Payment for skilled nursing facility (SNF) services shall be based on a PPS used in the Medicare program to pay for similar SNF services under 42 CFR part 413.

        (2) For Medicare participating hospitals that furnish inpatient services but are exempt from PPS and receive reimbursement based on reasonable costs (for example, critical access hospitals (CAHs), children's hospitals, cancer hospitals, and certain other hospitals reimbursed by Medicare under special arrangements), including provider subunits exempt from PPS, payment shall be made per discharge based on the reasonable cost methods established under 42 CFR part 413, except that the interim payment rate under 42 CFR part 413, subpart E shall constitute payment in full for authorized charges.

        (d)  In addition to the amount payable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for authorized inpatient services, payments shall include an amount to cover: The organ acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved transplantation centers; direct medical education costs; units of blood clotting factor furnished to an eligible patient who is a hemophiliac; and the costs of qualified non-physician anesthetists, to the extent such costs would be payable if the services had been covered by Medicare. Payment under this subsection shall be made on a per discharge basis and will be based on standard payments established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or its fiscal intermediaries.

        (e)  The calculation of the payment by I/T/Us will be based on determinations made under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section consistent with CMS instructions to its fiscal intermediaries at the time the claim is processed. Adjustments will be made to correct billing or claims processing errors, including when fraud is detected. I/T/Us shall pay the providing hospital the full PPS based rate, or the interim reasonable cost rate, without reduction for any co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles required by the Medicare program from the patient.

        (f)  Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of this section, if an amount has been negotiated with the hospital or its agent by the I/T/U, the I/T/U will pay the lesser of: The amount determined under paragraph (e) of this section or the amount negotiated with the hospital or its agent, including but not limited to capitated contracts or contracts per Federal law requirements;

        (g)  If an I/T/U has authorized payment for items and services provided to an individual who is eligible for benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, or another third party payor—

        (1) The I/T/U shall be the payor of last resort under § 136.61;

        (2) If there are any third party payers, the I/T/U will pay the amount for which the patient is being held responsible after the provider of services has coordinated benefits and all other alternative resources have been considered and paid, including applicable co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance that are owed by the patient; and

        (3) The maximum payment by the I/T/U will be only that portion of the payment amount determined under this section not covered by any other payor; and

        (4) The I/T/U payment will not exceed the rate calculated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section or the contracted amount (plus applicable cost sharing), whichever is less; and

        (5) When payment is made by Medicaid it is considered payment in full and there will be no additional payment made by the I/T/U to the amount paid by Medicaid (except for applicable cost sharing).

        (h)  For a hospital to be eligible for payment under this section, the hospital or its agent must submit the claim for authorized services—

        (1) On a UB92 paper claim form (until abolished, or on an officially adopted successor form) or the HIPAA 837 electronic claims format ANSI X12N, version 4010A1 (until abolished, or on an officially adopted successor form) and include the hospital's Medicare provider number/National Provider Identifier; and

        (2) To the I/T/U, agent, or fiscal intermediary identified by the I/T/U in the agreement between the I/T/U and the hospital or in the authorization for services provided by the I/T/U; and

        (3) Within a time period equivalent to the timely filing period for Medicare claims under 42 CFR 424.44 and provisions of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual applicable to the type of item or service provided.

        (i)  Payment shall be made only for those items and services authorized by an I/T/U consistent with part 136 of this title or section 503(a) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), Public Law 94-437, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1653(a).

        (j)  A payment made in accordance with this section shall constitute payment in full and the hospital or its agent may not impose any additional charge—

        (1) On the individual for I/T/U authorized items and services; or

        (2) For information requested by the I/T/U or its agent or fiscal intermediary for the purposes of payment determinations or quality assurance.

        (b) When the Secretary determines that a grantee has not taken corrective action (as prescribed by him under paragraph (a) of this section) to his satisfaction, he may, after providing the grantee an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, rescind the grant in whole or in part and if he deems it appropriate, assume or resume control or operation of the program, activity, or service involved.

        (c) When the Secretary has made a determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, he shall in writing notify the grantee of such determination and of the grantee's right to request a review of such determination (and of the determination described in paragraph (a) of this section) under the Public Health Service Grant Appeals Procedure (42 CFR part 50, subpart D). Such notification by the Secretary shall set forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the grantee to respond and shall inform the grantee of its opportunity for review under such subpart D.

      Subpart K—Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention

**Source:** Source: 67 FR 59467, Sept. 23, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

        § 136.401   Purpose.

#### § § 136.401

        (a) The purpose of the regulations in this subpart is to establish minimum standards for Federal employees working in the Indian Health Service (IHS), including standards of character to ensure that individuals having regular contact with or control over Indian children have not been convicted of certain types of crimes as mandated by section 408 of the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act (the “Act”), Public Law (Pub. L.) 101-630, 104 Stat. 4544, 25 U.S.C. 3201-3211, as amended by section 814 of the Native American Laws Technical Corrections Act of 2000. In order to implement these minimum standards of character, these regulations also address:

        (1) The efficiency standards to ensure that individuals are qualified for the positions they hold or seek, as mandated by Section 408 of the Act.

        (2) Fitness standards to ensure child care service employees are fit to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, as mandated by Section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 42 U.S.C. 13041.

        (3) Suitability standards to ensure that individuals have not acted in a manner that places others at risk or raised questions about their trustworthiness, as mandated by 5 CFR part 731.

        (b) The Act requires that Tribes or Tribal organizations who receive funds under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEA), Pub. L. 93-638, employ individuals in positions involving regular contact with or control over Indian children only if the individuals meet standards of character no less stringent than those prescribed under these regulations. Thus, the minimum standards of character as defined in these regulations will become the basis for Tribes or Tribal organizations to use when developing their own minimum standards of character that cannot be less stringent than as prescribed herein.

        § 136.402   Policy.

#### § § 136.402

        In enacting the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act, (the “Act”) the Congress recognized there is no resource more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian Tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian Tribe. The minimum standards of character as prescribed by the regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that Indian children are protected.

        § 136.403   Definitions.

        means responsibility for an Indian child(ren) within the scope of the individual's duties and responsibilities or contact with an Indian child(ren) on a recurring and foreseeable basis.

        as defined in the ISDEA, means the recognized governing body of any Indian Tribe or any legally established organization of Indians which is controlled, sanctioned, or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organization and which includes the maximum participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.

        § 136.404   What does the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act require of the IHS and Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations receiving funds under the ISDEA?

#### § § 136.404

        (a) The IHS must compile a list of all authorized positions with duties and responsibilities that involve regular contact with or control over Indian children; investigate the character of each individual who is employed or is being considered for employment in such a position; and prescribe minimum standards of character that each individual must meet to be appointed or employed in such positions.

        (b) All Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations receiving funds under the authority of the ISDEA must identify those positions that permit regular contact with or control over Indian children; conduct an investigation of the character of each individual who is employed or is being considered for employment in a position that involves regular contact with or control over Indian children; and employ only individuals who meet standards of character that are no less stringent than those prescribed by regulations in this subpart.

        § 136.405   What are the minimum standards of character for individuals placed in, or applying for, a position that involves regular contact with or control over Indian children?

#### § § 136.405

        The minimum standards of character shall mean a benchmark of moral, ethical, and emotional strengths established by character traits and past conduct to ensure that the individual is competent to complete his/her job without harm to Indian children. In order to protect Indian children, the IHS has established minimum standards of character requiring completion of a satisfactory background investigation that ensures that no individuals who have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any felonious offense or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses under Federal, State, or Tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children, are placed in positions involving regular contact with or control over Indian children.

        § 136.406   Under what circumstances will the minimum standards of character be considered to be met?

#### § § 136.406

        The minimum standards of character shall be considered met only after the individual has been the subject of a satisfactory background investigation. The background investigation shall include a review of:

        (a) The individual's trustworthiness, through inquiries with the individual's references and places of employment and education;

        (b) A criminal history background check, which includes a fingerprint check through the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under procedures approved by the FBI, and inquiries to State and Tribal law enforcement agencies for the previous five years of residence listed on the individual's application; and

        (c) A determination as to whether the individual has been found guilty of or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to any felonious offense or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses under Federal, State, or Tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children.

        § 136.407   Under what circumstances should a conviction, or plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, be considered if there has been a pardon, expungement, set aside, or other court order of the conviction or plea?

#### § § 136.407

        All convictions or pleas of nolo contendere or guilty to should be considered in making a determination unless a pardon, expungement, set aside or other court order reaches the plea of guilty, plea of nolo contendere, or the finding of guilt.

        § 136.408   What are other factors, in addition to the minimum standards of character, that may be considered in determining placement of an individual in a position that involves regular contact with or control over Indian children?

#### § § 136.408

        (a) All Federal employees are subject to suitability criteria contained in 5 CFR part 731 as a condition of employment.

        (b) Section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 42 U.S.C. 13041, provides that an individual may be disqualified from consideration or continuing employment if such individual has been convicted of a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim or a drug felony, or any other crime if such conviction bears on an individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children.

        (c) Tribes or Tribal organizations may but are not required to apply additional criteria in determining whether an individual is suitable for a position with duties and responsibilities that involve regular contact with or control over Indian children. Any additional suitability criteria established by Tribes or Tribal organizations beyond the minimum standards of character described in § 136.405 and § 136.406 would be determined by each individual Tribe or Tribal organization in accordance with its own personnel policies and procedures.

        § 136.409   What positions require a background investigation and determination of eligibility for employment or retention?

#### § § 136.409

        (a) All positions that allow an individual regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of eligibility for employment. The IHS has compiled a list of positions within the agency in which the duties and responsibilities could involve regular contact with or control over Indian children. The list will be periodically updated and made available at all IHS Personnel Offices upon request. Positions should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the individual in that position has regular contact with or control over Indian children.

        (b) Tribes and Tribal organizations may use the list compiled by the IHS or develop their own procedures to determine within their program those positions that involve regular contact with or control over Indian children.

        § 136.410   Who conducts the background investigation and prepares determinations of eligibility for employment?

#### § § 136.410

        (a) The IHS must use the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct background investigations for Federal employees. The IHS must designate qualified security personnel to adjudicate the results of background investigations.

        (b) Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations may conduct their own background investigations, contract with private firms, or may request that a Federal or State agency conduct investigations. (FBI criminal history record information, however, may only be received or evaluated by governmental agencies, including Tribes or Tribal organizations as defined in these regulations at § 136.403, and may not be disseminated to private entities.)

        § 136.411   Are the requirements for IHS adjudication different from the requirements for Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations?

#### § § 136.411

        Yes, in conducting background investigations and adjudicating eligibility for employment in Tribal positions that allow regular contact with or control over Indian children, Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations may, but are not required to, adopt portions of the rules in this subpart that are specifically applicable to employment with the IHS.

        § 136.412   What questions must the IHS ask as part of the background investigation?

#### § § 136.412

        (a) Applications for employment with the IHS must include the following questions:

        (1) Has the individual been arrested or charged with a crime involving a child? If yes, the individual must provide the date, explanation of the violation, disposition of the arrest or charge, place of occurrence, and the name and address of the police department or court involved.

        (2) Has the individual ever been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any felonious or misdemeanor offense, under Federal, State, or Tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children? If yes, the individual must provide an explanation of the violation, place of occurrence, date and disposition of the court proceeding, and the name and address of the police department or court involved.

        (b) The IHS must require that the individual sign, under penalty of perjury, a statement verifying the truth of all information provided in the employment application and acknowledging that knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact is a felony that may result in fines up to $10,000 or five years imprisonment, or both.

        (c) The IHS must inform the individual that a criminal history record check is a condition of employment and require the individual to consent in writing to a criminal history record check.

        § 136.413   What protections must the IHS and Tribes or Tribal organizations provide to individuals undergoing a background investigation?

#### § § 136.413

        (a) The IHS must comply with all policies, procedures, criteria, and guidance contained in other appropriate guidelines, such as the OPM policies, procedures, criteria, and guidance. Questions asked in § 136.412 will be added as an addendum to item #16 of the OPM Optional Form 306, “Declaration for Federal Employment.” The information is collected as part of the OPM Optional Form 306 and is safeguarded in accordance with Privacy Act provisions.

        (b) Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations must comply with the privacy requirements of the Federal, State, or other Tribal agency providing the background investigations. Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations may establish their own procedures that safeguard information derived from background investigations.

        § 136.414   How does the IHS determine eligibility for placement or retention of individuals in positions involving regular contact with Indian children?

#### § § 136.414

        (a) Adjudication is the process IHS uses to determine eligibility for placement or retention of individuals in positions involving regular contact with Indian children. The adjudication process protects the interests of the employer and the right of applicants and employees. Adjudication requires uniform evaluation to ensure fair and consistent judgment.

        (b) Each case is judged on its own merits. All available information, both favorable and unfavorable, should be considered and assessed in terms of accuracy, completeness, relevance, seriousness, overall significance, and how similar cases have been handled in the past.

        (c) The adjudicating official who conducts the adjudication must first have been the subject of a favorable background investigation.

        (d) Each adjudicating official must be thoroughly familiar with all laws, regulations, and criteria involved in making a determination for eligibility.

        (e) The adjudicating official must review the background investigation to determine the character, reputation, and trustworthiness of the individual. At a minimum, the background investigation must:

        (1) Review each security investigation form and employment application and compare the information provided.

        (2) Review the results of written record searches requested from local law enforcement agencies, former employers, former supervisors, employment references, and schools.

        (3) Review the results of the fingerprint charts maintained by the FBI or other law enforcement information maintained by other agencies.

        (4) Review any other information obtained through a background investigation, including the results of searches by State human services agencies, the OPM National Agency Check and Inquiries, the OPM Security/Suitability Investigations Index, and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index.

        (5) Determine whether the individual has been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any felonious offense, or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses under Federal, State, or Tribal law, involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children.

        (f) After an opportunity has been afforded the individual to respond, pursuant to § 136.415, and it is adjudicated that the individual has been found guilty of or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to an enumerated offense under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, that individual shall not be placed or retained in a position involving regular contact with or control over Indian children.

        (g) For individuals who have been determined to be ineligible for employment in positions having regular contact with or control over Indian children, the IHS may use Federal adjudicative standards to certify that an individual is suitable for employment in a position, if available, that does not involve regular contact with or control over Indian children. The adjudicating official must determine that the individual's prior conduct will not interfere with the performance of duties and will not create a potential risk to the safety and well-being of any Indian children after consideration of the following factors:

        (1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct in question.

        (2) The recency and circumstances surrounding the conduct in question.

        (3) The age of the individual at the time of the incident.

        (4) Societal conditions that may have contributed to the nature of the conduct.

        (5) The probability that the individual will continue the type of behavior in question.

        (6) The individual's commitment to rehabilitation and a change in the behavior in question.

        (7) The degree of public trust and the possibility the public would be placed at risk if the individual is appointed to the position.

        § 136.415   What rights does an individual have during this process?

#### § § 136.415

        (a) The individual must be provided an opportunity to explain, deny, or refute unfavorable and incorrect information gathered in an investigation, before the adjudication is final. He/she should receive a written summary of all derogatory information and be informed of the process for explaining, denying, or refuting unfavorable information.

        (b) The adjudicating officials must not release the actual background investigative report to an individual. However, they may issue a written summary of the derogatory information.

        (c) The individual who is the subject of a background investigation may request, to the extent permissible by law, a copy of the reports from the originating (Federal, State, or other Tribal) agency and challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information maintained by that agency.

        (d) The results of an investigation cannot be used for any purpose other than to determine eligibility for employment in a position that involves regular contact with or control over Indian children.

        (e) Investigative reports contain information of a highly personal nature and must be maintained confidentially and secured in locked files. Investigative reports must be seen only by those officials who, in performing their official duties, need to know the information contained in the report.

        § 136.416   When should the IHS deny employment or dismiss an employee?

#### § § 136.416

        The IHS must deny employment to an individual or dismiss an employee, when the duties and responsibilities of the position the individual person would hold or holds involve regular contact with or control over Indian children, and it has been adjudicated, pursuant to § 136.414 and § 136.415, that the individual has been found guilty of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, any felonious offense, or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses, under Federal, State or Tribal law involving a crime of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children. The IHS has the discretion to place such an individual in a position, if available, that does not involve regular contact with or control over Indian children, if a determination has been made that such placement would not put Indian children at risk and the individual would be able to perform the duties and responsibilities of this position.

        § 136.417   May the IHS hire individuals pending completion of a background investigation?

#### § § 136.417

        Pursuant to section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 42 U.S.C. 13041, as amended by Pub. L. 102-190, the IHS may hire provisionally individuals as defined in these regulations, prior to the completion of a background investigation if, at all times prior to receipt of the background investigation during which children are in the care of the individual, the individual is within the sight and under the supervision of a staff person and a satisfactory background investigation has been completed on that staff person.

        § 136.418   What should the IHS do if an individual has been charged with an offense but the charge is pending or no disposition has been made by a court?

#### § § 136.418

        (a) The IHS may deny the applicant employment until the charge has been resolved.

        (b) The IHS may deny the employee any on-the-job contact with children until the charge is resolved.

        (c) The IHS may detail or reassign the employee to other duties that do not involve regular contact with children.

        (d) The IHS may place the employee on indefinite suspension, in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, until the court has disposed of the charge.

      Subpart L—Indian Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund

        § 136.501   Definitions.

#### § § 136.501

        means health care resources other than those of the Indian Health Service (IHS or Service). Such resources include health care providers and institutions, and health care programs for the payment of health services including but not limited to programs under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act ( Medicare, Medicaid), State or local health care programs, and private insurance.

        means the fund established by Congress to reimburse extraordinary medical expenses incurred for catastrophic illnesses and disasters paid by a purchased/referred care (PRC) program of the IHS, whether such program is carried out by the IHS or an Indian Tribe or Tribal Organization under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA).

        refers to a medical condition that is costly by virtue of the intensity and/or duration of its treatment. Examples of conditions that frequently require multiple hospital stays and extensive treatment are cancer, burns, premature births, cardiac disease, end-stage renal disease, strokes, trauma-related cases such as automobile accidents and gunshot wounds, and some mental disorders. The CHEF is intended to insulate the IHS and Tribal PRC operations from financial disruption caused by the intensity of expenses incurred as a result of high cost illnesses and/or disasters.

        means a situation that poses a significant level of threat to life or health or causes loss of life or health stemming from events such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, catastrophic accidents, epidemics, fires, and explosions. The CHEF is intended to insulate the IHS and Tribal PRC operations from financial disruption caused by the intensity of expenses incurred as a result of high cost illnesses and/or disasters.

        means the period of consecutive days for a discrete health condition during which reasonable and necessary medical services related to the condition occur.

        means any health service that is—

        (1) Delivered based on a referral by, or at the expense of, an Indian health program; and

        (2) Provided by a public or private medical provider or hospital which is not a provider or hospital of the Indian health program.

        means an administrative entity of the Service or a Tribal Health Program through which services are provided, directly or by contract, to eligible Indians within a defined geographic area.

        means the annual designated amount above which incurred medical costs will be considered for the CHEF reimbursement after a review of the authorized expenses and diagnosis.

        § 136.502   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 136.502

        The CHEF is authorized by section 202 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) [25 U.S.C. 1621a]. The CHEF is administered by the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (“the Secretary”) acting through the Headquarters of IHS, solely for the purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses who are within the responsibility of the Service. This subpart:

        (a) Establishes definitions of terms governing the CHEF, including definitions of disasters and catastrophic illnesses for which the cost of treatment provided under contract would qualify for payment from the CHEF;

        (b) Establishes a threshold level for reimbursement for the cost of treatment;

        (c) Establishes procedures for reimbursement of the portion of the costs incurred by Service Units that exceeds such threshold costs, including procedures for when the exigencies of the medical circumstances warrant treatment prior to the authorization of such treatment by the Service; and

        (d) Establishes procedures for reimbursements pending the outcome or payment by alternate resources.

        § 136.503   Threshold cost.

#### § § 136.503

        A Service Unit shall not be eligible for reimbursement from the CHEF until its cost of treating any victim of a catastrophic illness or disaster for an episode of care has reached a certain threshold cost.

        (a) The threshold cost shall be established at the level of $19,000 for fiscal year 2024.

        (b) The threshold cost in subsequent years shall be calculated from the threshold cost of the previous year, increased by the percentage increase in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (United States city average) for the 12-month period ending with December of the previous year. The revised threshold costs shall be published yearly in the .

        § 136.504   Reimbursement procedure.

#### § § 136.504

        Service Units whose scope of work and funding include the purchase of medical services from private or public vendors under PRC are eligible to participate. The CHEF payments shall be based only on valid PRC expenditures, including expenditures for exigent medical circumstances without prior PRC authorization. Reimbursement from the CHEF will not be made if applicable PRC requirements are not followed.

        (a)  Requests for reimbursement from the CHEF must be submitted to the appropriate IHS Area Office. Area PRC programs will review requests for reimbursement to ensure compliance with PRC requirements, including but not limited to: patient eligibility, medical necessity, notification requirements for emergent and non-emergent care, medical priorities, allowable expenditures, and eligibility for alternate resources. Following this review, Area PRC programs may provide Service Units an opportunity to submit missing information or to resubmit documents that are indecipherable. Area PRC programs will then forward all requests to the Division of Contract Care, along with any recommendations or observations from the Area PRC program regarding compliance with PRC or other CHEF requirements. The Division of Contract Care will adjudicate the claim based upon an independent review of the claim documentation, but it may consider any recommendations or observations from the Area PRC program.

        (b)  All claims submitted for reimbursement may be submitted electronically utilizing the secure IHS system(s) established for this purpose or may be submitted in paper form but must include:

        (1) A fully completed Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund Reimbursement Request Form.

        (2) A statement of the provider's charges on a form that complies with the format required for the submission of claims under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, charges may be printed on forms such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 1500, UB-04 (formerly CMS-1450), American Dental Association (ADA) dental claim form, or National Council for Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP) universal claim forms. The forms submitted for review must include specific appropriate diagnostic and procedure codes.

        (3) An explanation of benefits or statement of payment identifying how much was paid to the provider by the Service Unit for the catastrophic illness or disaster. Payments to the patient or any other entity are ineligible for the CHEF reimbursement.

        (4) The Division of Contract Care may request additional medical documentation describing the medical treatment or service provided, including but not limited to discharge summaries and/or medical progress notes. Cases may be submitted for 50% reimbursement of eligible expenses pending discharge summaries. Medical documentation must be received to close the CHEF case.

        (c)  Because of the limitations of funds, full reimbursement cannot be guaranteed on all requests and will be based on the availability of funds at the time the IHS processes the claim. To the extent funds are available, the CHEF funds may not be used to cover the cost of services or treatment for which the funds were not approved. Unused funds, including but not limited to, funds unused due to overestimates, alternate resources, and cancellations must be returned to the CHEF.

        § 136.505   Reimbursable services.

#### § § 136.505

        The costs of catastrophic illnesses and disasters for distinct episodes of care are eligible for reimbursement from the CHEF in accordance with the medical priorities of the Service. Only services that are related to a distinct episode of care will be eligible for reimbursement. Some of the services that may qualify for reimbursement from the fund are:

        (a) Emergency treatment.

        (b) Emergent and acute inpatient hospitalization.

        (c) Ambulance services; air and ground (including patient escort travel costs).

        (d) Attending and consultant physician.

        (e) Functionally required reconstructive surgery.

        (f) Prostheses and other related items.

        (g) Reasonable rehabilitative therapy exclusive of custodial care not to exceed 30 days after discharge.

        (h) Skilled nursing care when the patient is discharged from the acute process to a skilled nursing facility.

        § 136.506   Alternate resources.

#### § § 136.506

        (a) Expenses paid by alternate resources are not eligible for payment by PRC or reimbursement by the CHEF. No payment shall be made from the CHEF to any Service Unit to the extent that the provider of services is eligible to receive payment for the treatment from any other Federal, State, local, or private source of reimbursement for which the patient is eligible. A patient shall be considered eligible for such resources and no payment shall be made from the CHEF if:

        (1) The patient is eligible for alternate resources; or

        (2) The patient would be eligible for alternate resources if he or she were to apply for them; or

        (3) The patient would be eligible for alternate resources under Federal, State, or local law or regulation but for the patient's eligibility for PRC, or other health services, from the Indian Health Service or Indian Health Service funded programs.

        (b) Patients are not required to expend personal resources for health services to meet alternate resource eligibility, nor are they required to sell valuables or property to become eligible for alternate resources.

        (c) When a PRC program pays primary to ( before) a Tribal self-insurance plan, this will not impact whether the PRC program's expenditures are eligible for reimbursement from the CHEF, as long as the Service Unit clearly demonstrates that the PRC program was responsible and did in fact assume that responsibility by making the payments at issue in the CHEF request.

        (d) The determination of whether a resource constitutes an alternate resource for the purpose of the CHEF reimbursement shall be made by the Headquarters of the Indian Health Service, irrespective of whether the resource was determined to be an alternate resource at the time of PRC payment.

        § 136.507   Program integrity.

#### § § 136.507

        All the CHEF records and documents will be subject to review by the respective IHS Area Office and by IHS Headquarters. Internal audits and administrative reviews may be conducted as necessary to ensure compliance with the regulations in this part and the CHEF policies.

        § 136.508   Recovery of reimbursement funds.

#### § § 136.508

        In the event a Service Unit has been reimbursed from the CHEF for an episode of care and that same episode of care becomes eligible for and is paid by any Federal, State, local, or private source (including third party insurance) the Service Unit shall return all the CHEF funds received for that episode of care to the CHEF at the IHS Headquarters. These recovered CHEF funds will be used to reimburse other valid CHEF requests.

        § 136.509   Reconsideration and appeals.

#### § § 136.509

        (a) Any Service Unit to whom payment from the CHEF is denied will be notified of the denial in writing together with a statement of the reason for the denial within 130 business days from receipt.

        (b) If a decision on the CHEF case is not made by the CHEF Program Manager within 180 calendar days from receipt, the Service Unit that submitted the claim may choose to appeal it as a deemed denial.

        (c) In order to seek review of a denial decision or deemed denial, the Service Unit must follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (1) Within 40 business days from the receipt of the denial provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Service Unit may submit a request in writing for reconsideration of the original denial to the Division of Contract Care. The request for reconsideration must include, as applicable, corrections to the original claim submission necessary to overcome the denial; or a statement and supporting documentation establishing that the original denial was in error. If no additional information is submitted the original denial will stand. The Service Unit may also request a telephone conference with the Division of Contract Care, to further explain the materials submitted, which shall be scheduled within 40 business days from receipt of the request for review. A decision by the Division of Contract Care shall be made within 130 business days of the request for review. The Division of Contract Care Director, or designee, shall review the application  with no deference to the original decision maker or to the applicant.

        (2) If the original decision is affirmed on reconsideration, the Service Unit will be notified in writing and advised that an appeal may be taken to the Director, Indian Health Service, within 40 business days of receipt of the denial. The appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth the grounds supporting the appeal. The Service Unit may also request a telephone conference through the Division of Contract Care, which shall be scheduled with the Director or a representative designated by the Director, to further explain the grounds supporting the appeal. A decision by the Director shall be made within 180 calendar days of the request for reconsideration. The decision of the Director, Indian Health Service or designee, shall constitute the final administrative action.

        § 136.510   Severability.

#### § § 136.510

        If any provision of this subpart is held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, as applied to any person or circumstance, or stayed pending further agency action, the provision shall be construed to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to those not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. However, if such holding is that the provision of this subpart is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this subpart and shall not affect the remainder thereof.

        § 136a.15   Health Service Delivery Areas.

#### § § 136a.15

        (a) The Indian Health Service will designate and publish as a notice in the  specific geographic areas within the United States including Federal Indian reservations and areas surrounding those reservations as Health Service Delivery Areas.

        (b) The Indian Health Service may, after consultation with all the Indian tribes affected, redesignate the boundaries of any Health Service Delivery Area followed by publication of a notice in the  Any redesignation of a Health Service Delivery area will include the reservation, and those areas close to the reservation boundaries which can reasonably be considered part of the reservation service area based on consideration of the following factors:

        (1) The number of persons residing in the off-reservation area who would be eligible under § 36a.12(a) (1) and (3).

        (2) The number of persons residing in the off-reservation area who have traditionally received health services from the Indian Health Service and whose eligibility for services would be affected;

        (3) The geographic proximity of the off-reservation area to the reservation; and

        (4) Whether the Indians residing in the off-reservation area can be expected to need and to use health services provided by the Indian Health Service given the alternate resources (health facilities and payment sources) available and accessible to them.

        (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Indian Health Service may designate States, subdivisions of States such as counties or towns, or other identifiable geographic areas such as census divisions or zip code areas, as Health Service Delivery Areas where reservations are nonexistent, or so small and scattered and the eligible Indian population so widely dispersed that it is inappropriate to use reservations as the basis for defining the Health Service Delivery Area.

        (d) Any Indian tribal government may request a change in the boundaries of the Health Service Delivery Area. Such a request should be supported by documentation related to the factors for consideration set out in paragraph (b) of this section and shall include documentation of any consultation with or notification of other affected or nearby tribes. The request shall be submitted to the appropriate Area Director(s) who shall afford all Indian tribes affected the opportunity to express their views orally and in writing. The Area Director(s) shall then submit the request, including all comments, together with the Area's recommendation and independent findings or verification of the factors set out in paragraph (b) of this section, to the Indian Health Service Director or to the Director's designee for the Indian Health Service decision. The decision of the Indian Health Service Director or the Director's designee shall constitute final agency action on the tribe's request. Changes in the boundaries of Health Service Delivery Areas will be published in the

        § 136a.16   Beneficiary Identification Cards and verification of tribal membership.

#### § § 136a.16

        (a) The Indian Health Service will issue Beneficiary Identification Cards as evidence of beneficiary status to persons who are currently eligible for services under § 36a.12(a). Persons requesting Beneficiary Identification Cards must submit or have on file evidence satisfactory to the Indian Health Service of tribal membership and residence within a Health Service Delivery Area. The absence of a Beneficiary Identification Card will not preclude an otherwise eligible Indian from obtaining services though it may delay the administrative determination that an individual is eligible for services on a no charge basis.

        (b) For establishing eligibility or obtaining a Beneficiary Identification Card, applicants must demonstrate that they are members of a federally recognized tribe. Membership in a federally recognized tribe is to be determined by the individual tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Therefore, the Indian Health Service will recognize two methods of demonstrating tribal membership:

        (1) Documentation that the applicant meets the requirements of tribal membership as prescribed by the charter, articles of incorporation, or other legal instruments or traditional processes of the tribe and has been officially designated a tribal member by an authorized tribal official or body; or

        (2) Certification of tribal enrollment or membership by the Secretary of the Interior acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

        (c) Demonstrating membership in a federally recognized tribe is the responsibility of the applicant. However, the Indian Health Service may consult with the appropriate tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs on outstanding questions regarding an applicant's tribal membership if the Indian Health Service has some documentation that it believes may be helpful to the tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs in making their determination.

#### § § 137.1

        (a) Authority. These regulations are prepared, issued and maintained with the active participation and representation of Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations and inter-Tribal consortia pursuant to the guidance of the negotiated rulemaking procedures required by section 517 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-16].

        § 137.2   Congressional policy.

#### § § 137.2

        (a) According to section 2 of Pub. L. 106-260, Congress has declared that:

        (1) The Tribal right of self-government flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and nations;

        (2) The United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes, including the right of the Indian Tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian Tribes;

        (3) Although progress has been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has eroded Tribal Self-Governance and dominates Tribal affairs.

        (4) The Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project, established under title III of the Indian Self-Determination Act (ISDA) [25 U.S.C. 450f note] was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States and to strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding and program management;

        (5) Although the Federal Government has made considerable strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its obligations to the Indian Tribes under treaties and other laws; and

        (6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring full control and funding to Tribal governments, upon Tribal request, over decision making for Federal PSFAs:

        (i) Is an appropriate and effective means of implementing the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes; and

        (ii) Strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.

        (b) According to section 3 of Pub. L. 106-260, Congress has declared its policy to:

        (1) Permanently establish and implement Tribal Self-Governance within the DHHS;

        (2) Call for full cooperation from the DHHS and its constituent agencies in the implementation of Tribal Self-Governance to—

        (i) Enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;

        (ii) Permit each Indian Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance in accordance with the provisions of the ISDA relating to the provision of Federal services to Indian Tribes;

        (iii) Ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indians;

        (iv) Affirm and enable the United States to fulfill its obligations to the Indian Tribes under treaties and other laws;

        (v) Strengthen the government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian Tribes through direct and meaningful consultation with all Tribes;

        (vi) Permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority, control, funding, and discretion to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer PSFAs that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities;

        (vii) Provide for a measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy as programs, services, functions, and activities (or portion thereof) are assumed by Indian Tribes;

        (viii) Encourage the Secretary to identify all PSFAs of the DHHS that may be managed by an Indian Tribe under this Act and to assist Indian Tribes in assuming responsibility for such PSFAs; and

        (ix) Provide Indian Tribes with the earliest opportunity to administer PSFAs from throughout the Department.

        (c) According to section 512(a) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-11(a)], Congress has declared, except as otherwise provided by law, the Secretary shall interpret all Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations in a manner that will facilitate:

        (1) The inclusion of PSFAs and funds associated therewith, in the agreements entered into under this section;

        (2) The implementation of compacts and funding agreements entered into under this title; and

        (3) The achievement of Tribal health goals and objectives.

        (d) According to section 512(f) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-11(f)], Congress has declared that each provision of Title V and each provision of a compact or funding agreement shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Indian Tribe participating in and any ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of the Indian Tribe.

        (e) According to section 515(b) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-14(b)], Congress has declared that nothing in the Act shall be construed to diminish in any way the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and individual Indians that exists under treaties, Executive orders, or other laws and court decisions.

        (f) According to section 507(g) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-6(g)], Congress has declared that the Secretary is prohibited from waiving, modifying, or diminishing in any way the trust responsibility of the United States with respect to Indian Tribes and individual Indians that exists under treaties, Executive orders, other laws, or court decisions.

        (g) According to section 515(c) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-14(c)], Congress has declared that the Indian Health Service (IHS) under this Act shall neither bill nor charge those Indians who may have the economic means to pay for services, nor require any Tribe to do so. Nothing in this section shall impair the right of the IHS or an Indian Tribe to seek recovery from third parties section 206 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act [25 U.S.C. 1621e], under section 1 of the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act [42 U.S.C. 2651], and any other applicable Federal, State or Tribal law.

        (h) According to section 507(e) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-6(e)], Congress has declared that in the negotiation of compacts and funding agreements the Secretary shall at all times negotiate in good faith to maximize implementation of the self-governance policy. The Secretary shall carry out Title V in a manner that maximizes the policy of Tribal Self-Governance, and in a manner consistent with the purposes specified in section 3 of the Act.

        § 137.3   Effect on existing Tribal rights.

#### § § 137.3

        Nothing in this part shall be construed as:

        (a) Affecting, modifying, diminishing, or otherwise impairing the sovereign immunity from suit enjoyed by Indian Tribes;

        (b) Terminating, waiving, modifying, or reducing the trust responsibility of the United States to the Indian Tribe(s) or individual Indians. The Secretary must act in good faith in upholding this trust responsibility;

        (c) Mandating an Indian Tribe to apply for a compact(s) or grant(s) as described in the Act; or

        (d) Impeding awards by other Departments and agencies of the United States to Indian Tribes to administer Indian programs under any other applicable law.

        § 137.4   May Title V be construed to limit or reduce in any way the funding for any program, project, or activity serving an Indian Tribe under this or other applicable Federal law?

#### § § 137.4

        No, if an Indian Tribe alleges that a compact or funding agreement violates section 515(a) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-14(a)], the Indian Tribe may apply the provisions of section 110 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450m-1].

        In carrying out Tribal self-governance under Title V, the Secretary recognizes the right of Tribes to self-government and supports Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. The Secretary recognizes a unique legal relationship with Tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court decisions.

#### § § 137.210

          To the extent that PSFAs carried out by Self-Governance Tribes under Title V reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of Tribal shares and other funds determined under section 508(c) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(c)], the Secretary must make such savings available to the Self-Governance Tribes, for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries in a manner equitable to directly served, contracted, and compacted programs.

          APA means Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

          Budget means a statement of the funds required to complete the scope of work in a construction project agreement. For cost reimbursement agreements, budgets may be stated using broad categories such as planning, design, construction, project administration, and contingency. For fixed price agreements, budgets may be stated as lump sums, unit cost pricing, or a combination thereof.

          Categorical exclusion means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementation of these regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Any procedures under this section shall provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.

          CEQ means Council on Environmental Quality in the Office of the President.

          Construction management services (CMS) means activities limited to administrative support services; coordination; and monitoring oversight of the planning, design, and construction process. CMS activities typically include:

          (1) Coordination and information exchange between the Self-Governance Tribe and the Federal Government;

          (2) Preparation of a Self-Governance Tribe's project agreement; and

          (3) A Self-Governance Tribe's subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of construction contract subcontractors.

          Construction phase is the phase of a construction project agreement during which the project is constructed, and includes labor, materials, equipment and services necessary to complete the work, in accordance with the construction project agreement.

          Construction project means:

          (1) An organized noncontinuous undertaking to complete a specific set of predetermined objectives for the planning, environmental determination, design, construction, repair, improvement, or expansion of buildings or facilities described in a project agreement, and

        NEPA Process

          § 137.285   Are Self-Governance Tribes required to accept Federal environmental responsibilities to enter into a construction project agreement?

#### § § 137.285

          Yes, under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8], Self-Governance Tribes must assume all Federal responsibilities under the NEPA of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 ] and the National Historic Preservation Act [16 U.S.C. 470 ] and related provisions of law that would apply if the Secretary were to undertake a construction project, but only those responsibilities directly related to the completion of the construction project being assumed.

          § 137.286   Do Self-Governance Tribes become Federal agencies when they assume these Federal environmental responsibilities?

#### § § 137.286

          No, while Self-Governance Tribes are required to assume Federal environmental responsibilities for projects in place of the Secretary, Self-Governance Tribes do not thereby become Federal agencies. However, because Self-Governance Tribes are assuming the responsibilities of the Secretary for the purposes of performing these Federal environmental responsibilities, Self-Governance Tribes will be considered the equivalent of Federal agencies for certain purposes as set forth in this subpart.

          § 137.287   What is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?

#### § § 137.287

          The NEPA is a procedural law that requires Federal agencies to follow established environmental review procedures, which include reviewing and documenting the environmental impact of their actions. NEPA establishes a comprehensive policy for protection and enhancement of the environment by the Federal Government; creates the Council on Environmental Quality in the Office of the President; and directs Federal agencies to carry out the policies and procedures of the Act. CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508) establish three levels of environmental review: categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental impact statements.

          § 137.288   What is the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)?

#### § § 137.288

          The NHPA requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings, such as construction projects, on properties covered by the NHPA, such as historic properties, properties eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, or properties that an Indian Tribe regards as having religious and/or cultural importance. Section 106 of the NHPA [16 U.S.C. 470f] requires Federal agencies to afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, acting through the SHPO or the THPO, a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings.

          § 137.289   What is a Federal undertaking under NHPA?

#### § § 137.289

          The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has defined a Federal undertaking in 36 CFR 800.16(y) as a project, activity, or program funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including those carried out by or on behalf of a Federal agency; those carried out with Federal financial assistance; those requiring a Federal permit, license or approval; and those subject to State or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency.

          § 137.290   What additional provisions of law are related to NEPA and NHPA?

          (b) This section provides a list of environmental laws for informational purposes only and does not create any legal rights or remedies, or imply private rights of action.

          § 137.291   May Self-Governance Tribes carry out construction projects without assuming these Federal environmental responsibilities?

#### § § 137.291

          Yes, but not under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]. Self-Governance Tribes may otherwise elect to perform construction projects, or phases of construction projects, under other legal authorities (see § 137.272).

          § 137.292   How do Self-Governance Tribes assume environmental responsibilities for construction projects under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.292

          Self-Governance Tribes assume environmental responsibilities by:

          (a) Adopting a resolution or taking an equivalent Tribal action which:

          (1) Designates a certifying officer to represent the Self-Governance Tribe and to assume the status of a responsible Federal official under NEPA, NHPA, and related provisions of law; and

          (2) Accepts the jurisdiction of the Federal court, as provided in § 137.310 and § 137.311 for purposes of enforcement of the Federal environmental responsibilities assumed by the Self-Governance Tribe; and

          (b) Entering into a construction project agreement under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8].

          § 137.293   Are Self-Governance Tribes required to adopt a separate resolution or take equivalent Tribal action to assume environmental responsibilities for each construction project agreement?

#### § § 137.293

          No, the Self-Governance Tribe may adopt a single resolution or take equivalent Tribal action to assume environmental responsibilities for a single project, multiple projects, a class of projects, or all projects performed under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8].

          § 137.294   What is the typical IHS environmental review process for construction projects?

#### § § 137.294

          (a) Most IHS construction projects normally do not have a significant impact on the environment, and therefore do not require environmental impact statements (EIS). Under current IHS procedures, an environmental review is performed on all construction projects. During the IHS environmental review process, the following activities may occur:

          (1) Consult with appropriate Tribal, Federal, state, and local officials and interested parties on potential environmental effects;

          (2) Document assessment of potential environmental effects; (IHS has developed a form to facilitate this process.)

          (3) Perform necessary environmental surveys and inventories;

          (4) Consult with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, acting through the SHPO or THPO, to ensure compliance with the NHPA;

          (5) Determine if extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist that would prevent the project from meeting the criteria for categorical exclusion from further environmental review under NEPA, or if an environmental assessment is required;

          (6) Obtain environmental permits and approvals; and

          (7) Identify methods to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects;

          (b) This section is for informational purposes only and does not create any legal rights or remedies, or imply private rights of action.

          § 137.295   May Self-Governance Tribes elect to develop their own environmental review process?

#### § § 137.295

          Yes, Self-Governance Tribes may develop their own environmental review process or adopt the procedures of the IHS or the procedures of another Federal agency.

          § 137.296   How does a Self-Governance Tribe comply with NEPA and NHPA?

#### § § 137.296

          Self-Governance Tribes comply with NEPA and the NHPA by adopting and following:

          (a) their own environmental review procedures;

          (b) the procedures of the IHS; and/or

          (c) the procedures of another Federal agency.

          § 137.297   If the environmental review procedures of a Federal agency are adopted by a Self-Governance Tribe, is the Self-Governance Tribe responsible for ensuring the agency's policies and procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA, and related environmental laws?

#### § § 137.297

          No, the Federal agency is responsible for ensuring its own policies and procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA, and related environmental laws, not the Self-Governance Tribe.

          § 137.298   Are Self-Governance Tribes required to comply with Executive Orders to fulfill their environmental responsibilities under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.298

          No, but Self-Governance Tribes may at their option, choose to voluntarily comply with Executive Orders. For facilities where ownership will vest with the Federal Government upon completion of the construction, Tribes and the Secretary may agree to include the goals and objectives of Executive Orders in the codes and standards of the construction project agreement.

          § 137.299   Are Federal funds available to cover the cost of Self-Governance Tribes carrying out environmental responsibilities?

#### § § 137.299

          Yes, funds are available:

          (a) for project-specific environmental costs through the construction project agreement; and

          (b) for environmental review program costs through a funding agreement and/or a construction project agreement.

          § 137.300   Since Federal environmental responsibilities are new responsibilities, which may be assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8], are there additional funds available to Self-Governance Tribes to carry out these formerly inherently Federal responsibilities?

#### § § 137.300

          Yes, the Secretary must transfer not less than the amount of funds that the Secretary would have otherwise used to carry out the Federal environmental responsibilities assumed by the Self-Governance Tribe.

          § 137.301   How are project and program environmental review costs identified?

#### § § 137.301

          (a) The Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary should work together during the initial stages of project development to identify program and project related costs associated with carrying out environmental responsibilities for proposed projects. The goal in this process is to identify the costs associated with all foreseeable environmental review activities.

          (b) If unforeseen environmental review and compliance costs are identified during the performance of the construction project, the Self-Governance Tribe or, at the request of the Self-Governance Tribe, the Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary (with or without amendment as required by § 137.363) may do one or more of the following:

          (1) Mitigate adverse environmental effects;

          (2) Alter the project scope of work; and/or

          (3) Add additional program and/or project funding, including seeking supplemental appropriations.

          (a) Yes, start-up costs are available as provided in section 508(c) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(c)]. During the initial year that these responsibilities are assumed, the amount required to be paid under section 106(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j-1(a)(2)] must include startup costs consisting of the reasonable costs that have been incurred or will be incurred on a one-time basis pursuant to the agreement necessary:

          (1) To plan, prepare for, and assume operation of the environmental responsibilities; and

          (2) To ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement and prudent management.

          (b) Costs incurred before the initial year that the agreement is in effect may not be included in the amount required to be paid under section 106(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j-1(a)(2)] if the Secretary does not receive a written notification of the nature and extent of the costs prior to the date on which such costs are incurred.

          § 137.303   Are Federal or other funds available for training associated with Tribal assumption of environmental responsibilities?

#### § § 137.303

          Yes, Self-Governance Tribes may use construction program and project funds for training and program development. Training and program development funds may also be available from other Federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Park Service, state and local governments, and private organizations.

#### § § 137.304

          Yes, Self-Governance Tribes may “buy back” project related services in their construction project agreement, including design and construction engineering, and environmental compliance services from the IHS in accordance with Section 508(f) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(f)] and § 137.95, subject to the availability of the IHS's capacity to conduct the work.

          § 137.305   May Self-Governance Tribes act as lead, cooperating, or joint lead agencies for environmental review purposes?

#### § § 137.305

          Yes, Self-Governance Tribes assuming Federal environmental responsibilities for construction projects under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] are entitled to receive equal consideration, on the same basis as any Federal agency, for lead, cooperating, and joint lead agency status. For informational purposes, the terms “lead,” “cooperating,” and “joint lead agency” are defined in the CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1508.16, 1508.5, and 1501.5 respectively.

          § 137.306   How are Self-Governance Tribes recognized as having lead, cooperating, or joint lead agency status?

#### § § 137.306

          Self-Governance Tribes may be recognized as having lead, cooperating, or joint lead agency status through funding or other agreements with other agencies. To the extent that resources are available, the Secretary will encourage and facilitate Federal, state, and local agencies to enter into agreements designating Tribes as lead, cooperating, or joint lead agencies for environmental review purposes.

          § 137.307   What Federal environmental responsibilities remain with the Secretary when a Self-Governance Tribe assumes Federal environmental responsibilities for construction projects under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.307

          (a) All environmental responsibilities for Federal actions not directly related to construction projects assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] remain with the Secretary. Federal agencies, including the IHS, retain responsibility for ensuring their environmental review procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA and related provisions of law, as called for in § 137.297.

          (b) The Secretary will provide information updating and changing IHS agency environmental review policy and procedures to all Self-Governance Tribes implementing a construction project agreement, and to other Indian Tribes upon request. If a Self-Governance Tribe participating under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] does not wish to receive this information, it must notify the Secretary in writing. As resources permit, at the request of the Self-Governance Tribe, the Secretary will provide technical assistance to the Self-governance tribe to assist the Self-governance Tribe in carrying out Federal environmental responsibilities.

          § 137.308   Does the Secretary have any enforcement authority for Federal environmental responsibilities assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.308

          No, the Secretary does not have any enforcement authority for Federal environmental responsibilities assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8].

          § 137.309   How are NEPA and NHPA obligations typically enforced?

#### § § 137.309

          NEPA and NHPA obligations are typically enforced by interested parties who may file lawsuits against Federal agencies alleging that the agencies have not complied with their legal obligations under NEPA and NHPA. These lawsuits may only be filed in Federal court under the provisions of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. Under the APA, a Federal judge reviews the Federal agency's actions based upon an administrative record prepared by the Federal agency. The judge gives appropriate deference to the agency's decisions and does not substitute the court's views for those of the agency. Jury trials and civil discovery are not permitted in APA proceedings. If a Federal agency has failed to comply with NEPA or NHPA, the judge may grant declaratory or injunctive relief to the interested party. No money damages or fines are permitted in APA proceedings.

          § 137.310   Are Self-Governance Tribes required to grant a limited waiver of their sovereign immunity to assume Federal environmental responsibilities under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.310

          Yes, but only as provided in this section. Unless Self-Governance Tribes consent to the jurisdiction of a court, Self-Governance Tribes are immune from civil lawsuits. Self-Governance Tribes electing to assume Federal environmental responsibilities under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] must provide a limited waiver of sovereign immunity solely for the purpose of enforcing a Tribal certifying officer's environmental responsibilities, as set forth in this subpart. Self-Governance Tribes are not required to waive any other immunity.

          § 137.311   Are Self-Governance Tribes entitled to determine the nature and scope of the limited immunity waiver required under section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)]?

#### § § 137.311

          (a) Yes, Section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)] only requires that the waiver permit a civil enforcement action to be brought against the Tribal certifying officer in his or her official capacity in Federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief in a procedure that is substantially equivalent to an APA enforcement action against a Federal agency. Self-Governance Tribes are not required to subject themselves to suit in their own name, to submit to trial by jury or civil discovery, or to waive immunity for money damages, attorneys fees, or fines.

          (b) Self-Governance Tribes may base the grant of a limited waiver under this subpart on the understanding that:

          (1) Judicial review of the Tribal certifying official's actions are based upon the administrative record prepared by the Tribal official in the course of performing the Federal environmental responsibilities; and

          (2) Actions and decisions of the Tribal certifying officer will be granted deference on a similar basis as Federal officials performing similar functions.

          § 137.312   Who is the proper defendant in a civil enforcement action under section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)]?

#### § § 137.312

          Only the designated Tribal certifying officer acting in his or her official capacity may be sued. Self-Governance Tribes and other Tribal officials are not proper defendants in lawsuits brought under section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)].

        Notification (Prioritization Process, Planning, Development and Construction)

          § 137.320   Is the Secretary required to consult with affected Indian Tribes concerning construction projects and programs?

#### § § 137.320

          Yes, before developing a new project resource allocation methodology and application process the Secretary must consult with all Indian Tribes. In addition, before spending any funds for planning, design, construction, or renovation projects, whether subject to a competitive application and ranking process or not, the Secretary must consult with any Indian Tribe that would be significantly affected by the expenditure to determine and honor Tribal preferences whenever practicable concerning the size, location, type, and other characteristics of the project.

          § 137.321   How do Indian Tribes and the Secretary identify and request funds for needed construction projects?

#### § § 137.321

In developing budget justifications for specific projects to be proposed to Congress, the Secretary shall follow the preferences of the affected Indian Tribe(s) to the greatest extent feasible concerning the size, location, type, and other characteristics of the project.

          § 137.322   Is the Secretary required to notify an Indian Tribe that funds are available for a construction project or a phase of a project?

#### § § 137.322

          (a) Yes, within 30 days after the Secretary's allocation of funds for planning phase, design phase, or construction phase activities for a specific project, the Secretary shall notify, by registered mail with return receipt in order to document mailing, the Indian Tribe(s) to be benefitted by the availability of the funds for each phase of a project. The Secretarial notice of fund allocation shall offer technical assistance in the preparation of a construction project proposal.

          (b) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian Tribe, furnish the Indian Tribe with all information available to the Secretary about the project including, but not limited to: construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports and archeological reports.

          (c) An Indian Tribe is not required to request this information prior to either submitting a notification of intent or a construction project proposal.

          (d) The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility to furnish information to the Indian Tribes.

        Project Assumption Process

          § 137.325   What does a Self-Governance Tribe do if it wants to perform a construction project under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

#### § § 137.325

          (a) A Self-Governance Tribe may start the process of developing a construction project agreement by:

          (1) Notifying the Secretary in writing that the Self-Governance Tribe wishes to enter into a pre-agreement negotiation phase as set forth in section 105(m)(3) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j(m)(3)]; or

          (2) Submitting a proposed construction project agreement. This proposed agreement may be the final proposal, or it may be a draft for consideration and negotiation, or

          (3) A combination of the actions described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

          (b) Upon receiving a Self-Governance Tribe's request to enter into a pre-negotiation phase the Secretary shall take the steps outlined in section 105(m)(3) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j(m)(3)].

          § 137.326   What must a Tribal proposal for a construction project agreement contain?

#### § § 137.326

          A construction project proposal must contain all of the required elements of a construction project agreement as defined in § 137.280. In addition to these minimum requirements, Self-Governance Tribes may propose additional items.

          § 137.327   May multiple projects be included in a single construction project agreement?

#### § § 137.327

          Yes, a Self-Governance Tribe may include multiple projects in a single construction project agreement proposal or may add additional approved projects by amendment(s) to an existing construction project agreement.

          § 137.328   Must a construction project proposal incorporate provisions of Federal construction guidelines and manuals?

#### § § 137.328

          (a) No, the Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary must agree upon and specify appropriate building codes and architectural and engineering standards (including health and safety) which must be in conformity with nationally recognized standards for comparable projects.

          (b) The Secretary may provide, or the Self-Governance Tribe may request, Federal construction guidelines and manuals for consideration by the Self-Governance Tribe in the preparation of its construction project proposal. If Tribal construction codes and standards (including national, regional, State, or Tribal building codes or construction industry standards) are consistent with or exceed otherwise applicable nationally recognized standards, the Secretary must accept the Tribally proposed standards.

          § 137.329   What environmental considerations must be included in the construction project agreement?

#### § § 137.329

          The construction project agreement must include:

          (a) Identification of the Tribal certifying officer for environmental review purposes,

          (b) Reference to the Tribal resolution or equivalent Tribal action appointing the Tribal certifying officer and accepting the jurisdiction of the Federal court for enforcement purposes as provided in §§ 137.310 and 137.311.

          (c) Identification of the environmental review procedures adopted by the Self-Governance Tribe, and

          (d) An assurance that no action will be taken on the construction phase of the project that would have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives prior to making an environmental determination in accordance with the Self-Governance Tribe's adopted procedures.

          § 137.330   What happens if the Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary cannot develop a mutually agreeable construction project agreement?

#### § § 137.330

          The Self-Governance Tribe may submit a final construction project proposal to the Secretary. No later than 30 days after the Secretary receives the final construction project proposal, or within a longer time agreed to by the Self-Governance Tribe in writing, the Secretary shall review and make a determination to approve or reject the construction project proposal in whole or in part.

          § 137.331   May the Secretary reject a final construction project proposal based on a determination of Tribal capacity or capability?

#### § § 137.331

          No, the Secretary may not reject a final construction project proposal based on a determination of Tribal capacity or capability.

          § 137.332   On what basis may the Secretary reject a final construction project proposal?

#### § § 137.332

          (a) The only basis for rejection of project activities in a final construction project proposal are:

          (1) The amount of funds proposed in the final construction project proposal exceeds the applicable funding level for the construction project as determined under sections 508(c) [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(c)] and 106 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j-1].

          (2) The final construction project proposal does not meet the minimum content requirements for construction project agreements set forth in section 501(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa(a)(2)]; and

          (3) The final construction project proposal on its face clearly demonstrates that the construction project cannot be completed as proposed.

          (b) For construction programs proposed to be included in a construction project agreement, the Secretary may also reject that portion of the proposal that proposes to assume an inherently Federal function that cannot legally be delegated to the Self-Governance Tribe.

          § 137.333   What procedures must the Secretary follow if the Secretary rejects a final construction project proposal, in whole or in part?

#### § § 137.333

          Whenever the Secretary rejects a final construction project proposal in whole or in part, the Secretary must:

          (a) Send the Self-Governance Tribe a timely written notice of rejection that shall set forth specific finding(s) that clearly demonstrates, or that is supported by controlling legal authority supporting the rejection;

With respect to any hearing or appeal or civil action conducted pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence the validity of the grounds for rejecting the final construction project proposal (or portion thereof); and

          (e) Provide the Self-Governance Tribe with the option of entering into the severable portions of a final proposed construction project agreement (including a lesser funding amount) that the Secretary did not reject, subject to any additional alterations necessary to conform the construction project agreement to the severed provisions. Exercising this option does not affect the Self-Governance Tribe's right to appeal the portion of the final construction project proposal that was rejected by the Secretary.

          § 137.334   What happens if the Secretary fails to notify the Self-Governance Tribe of a decision to approve or reject a final construction project proposal within the time period allowed?

#### § § 137.334

          If the Secretary fails to notify the Self-Governance Tribe of the decision to approve or reject within 30 days (or a longer period if agreed to by the Self-Governance Tribe in writing), then the proposal will be deemed approved by the Secretary.
