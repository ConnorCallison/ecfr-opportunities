        § 167.45-1   Steam, carbon dioxide, Halon 1301, and clean agent fire extinguishing systems.

#### § § 167.45-1

        (a)  (1) Nautical school ships shall be provided with an inert-gas fire-extinguishing system when required.

        (2) All nautical school ships carrying combustible cargo in the holds, between decks, or other closed cargo compartments shall be equipped with means for extinguishing fire in such compartments by the use of any inert-gas fire-extinguishing system approved by the Coast Guard or Navy. However, in specific cases where by reason of the design, such compartments are normally accessible and considered to be part of the working or living quarters, a water sprinkling system may be installed in lieu of an inert-gas fire-extinguishing system. On such vessels contracted for prior to January 1, 1962, a steam smothering system may be accepted in lieu of the inert gas system for the protection of cargo holds, paint lockers, and similar spaces. However, although existing steam smothering systems may be repaired, replaced, or extended, no new systems contracted for on or after January 1, 1962, will be permitted.

        (3) Cabinets, boxes, or casings enclosing manifolds or valves must be marked in conspicuous red letters at least 2 inches high: “[STEAM/CARBON DIOXIDE/HALON/CLEAN AGENT—as appropriate] FIRE APPARATUS.”.

        (4) Steam or gas piping fitted for extinguishing fire shall not be used for any other purpose except that it may be used for fire-detecting purposes.

        (5) Pipes for conveying steam from the boilers for the purpose of extinguishing fire shall not be led into the cabins, other living spaces, or working spaces. Pipes for conveying carbon dioxide or other extinguishing vapors for the purpose of extinguishing fire shall not be led into the cabins or other living spaces.

        (6) Steam smothering lines shall be tested with at least 50 pounds air pressure with ends of the smothering lines capped, or by blowing steam through the lines, and a survey made for detecting corrosion and defects, using the hammer test or such other means as may be necessary.

        (7) At annual inspections, each carbon dioxide cylinder, whether fixed or portable, each Halon 1301 cylinder, and each clean agent cylinder must be examined externally and replaced if excessive corrosion is found; and:

        (i) Each carbon dioxide cylinder must be weighed and recharged if its weight loss exceeds 10 percent of the charge;

        (ii) Each Halon 1301 and halocarbon cylinder must be weighed and checked, and recharged or replaced if weight loss exceeds 5 percent of required weight of charge or if cylinder pressure loss exceeds 10 percent of specified gauge pressure, adjusted for temperature; and

        (iii) Each inert gas cylinder must be checked and recharged or replaced if cylinder pressure loss exceeds 5 percent of specified gauge pressure adjusted for temperature.

        (8) Carbon dioxide, Halon 1301, and clean agent cylinders carried on board nautical school ships must be tested and marked in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 147.60, 147.65, 147.66, and 147.67.

        (9) On all systems test time delays, alarms, and ventilation shutdowns with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other nonflammable gas as stated in the system manufacturer's instruction manual. Inspect hoses for damage or decay. Ensure that nozzles are unobstructed.

        (b)  (1) As noted in subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, steam smothering systems are not permitted on nautical school ships contracted for on or after January 1, 1962, nor for new installations on vessels contracted for prior to that date. Where steam smothering systems are installed, the provisions of this paragraph shall be met.

        (2) Steam for fire-extinguishing systems shall be available at a suitable pressure from the main boilers or a donkey or auxiliary boiler.

        (3) The pipe lines shall be led from not more than three stations in easily accessible locations on the weather deck to each cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, or other closed cargo compartments, and to each cargo-oil deep tank, lamp locker, oil room, and like compartments, which lamp locker, oil room, and like compartments, shall be wholly and tightly lined with metal. The steam connections to the lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments may be taken from the nearest steam supply line, independent of the extinguishing manifolds. In lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments, adequate means may be provided for ventilation if suitable dampers capable of being operated from outside the spaces are fitted in each vent duct.

        (4) Each pipe in the extinguishing manifolds shall be fitted with a shut-off valve plainly and permanently marked to indicate into which compartment it discharges. This requirement also applies to independent extinguishing lines.

        (5) Manifold steam supply pipes shall be fitted with master valves at the manifolds, and provision shall be made for draining the manifold and individual lines to protect them against freezing. If the manifolds are located on an open deck, they shall be enclosed in a metal box.

        (6) The minimum diameter of any steam fire-extinguishing pipe to a cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, other closed cargo compartments, or cargo-oil deep tank shall be one inch, the size and number of pipes to be governed by the size of the compartment. The minimum diameter of any steam fire-extinguishing pipe to a lamp locker, oil room, or like compartments, shall be three-fourths of an inch.

        (c)  (1) When a carbon dioxide (CO) smothering system is fitted in the cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, or other closed cargo compartments, or cargo-oil deep tanks, the quantity of carbon dioxide shall be sufficient to give a gas saturation of 30 percent of the gross volume of the largest cargo hold. The quantity in pounds of carbon dioxide required may be determined approximately by the following formula:

        (*2*) When a carbon dioxide (CO) smothering system is fitted in the lamp locker, oil room, or like compartments, the quantity in pounds of carbon dioxide required may be determined by dividing the gross volume of the space by a factor of 22. Lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments, in all classes of vessels, shall be wholly and tightly lined with metal. The whole charge of gas shall be capable of being released simultaneously by operating one valve and control, and all cylinders shall be completely discharged in not more than two minutes.

        (3) Pipes used for supplying carbon dioxide to the cargo holds, cargo 'tween-decks, other closed cargo compartments, and cargo-oil deep tanks shall be not less than three-fourths inch inside diameter. Pipes used for supplying carbon dioxide to lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments shall not be less than one-half inch inside diameter.

        (4) The control(s) releasing the inert gas shall be located in a position(s) outside the space(s) protected and shall be readily accessible when the vessel is being navigated. All valves shall be permanently marked to indicate into which compartment they discharge. A space which is protected by a carbon dioxide extinguishing system, and is normally accessible to crew while the nautical school ship is being navigated shall be fitted with an approved audible alarm in such space, which will be automatically sounded when the carbon dioxide is admitted to the space.

        (5) Provisions shall be made to prevent the admission of air into the lower parts of cargo holds, cargo 'tween-decks, and other closed cargo compartments while the inert-gas system is in operation.

        (6) Cylinders, piping, and controls for the inert-gas system shall be protected from damage and shall be securely fastened and supported.

        (2) The lockout valve must be a manually operated valve located in the discharge manifold prior to the stop valve or selector valves. When in the closed position, the lockout valve must provide complete isolation of the system from the protected space or spaces, making it impossible for carbon dioxide to discharge in the event of equipment failure during maintenance.

        (3) The lockout valve design or locking mechanism must make it obvious whether the valve is open or closed.

        (4) A valve is considered a lockout valve if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which, a lock can be affixed, or it has a locking mechanism built into it.

        (5) The master or person-in-charge must ensure that the valve is locked open at all times, except while maintenance is being performed on the extinguishing system, when the valve must be locked in the closed position.

        (6) Lockout valves added to existing systems must be approved by the Commandant as part of the installed system.

        (e) Each carbon dioxide extinguishing system installed or altered after [July 9, 2013, must have an approved odorizing unit to produce the scent of wintergreen, the detection of which will serve as an indication that carbon dioxide gas is present in a protected area and any other area into which the carbon dioxide may migrate. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.

        § 170.090   Calculations.

#### § § 170.090

        (a) All calculations required by this subchapter must be submitted with the plans required by § 170.075 of this subpart. Calculations must account for the weight of all loads carried aboard the vessel.

        (b) If it is necessary to compute and plot any of the following curves as part of the calculations required in this subchapter, these plots must also be submitted:

        (1) Righting arm or moment curves.

        (2) Heeling arm or moment curves.

        (3) Cross curves of stability.

        (4) Floodable length curves.

        (c) The assumed weight per person for calculations showing compliance with the regulations of this subchapter must be representative of the passengers and crew aboard the vessel while engaged in the service intended. Unless the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) permits or requires the use of other values in writing, the assumed weight per person of passengers and crew must not be less than that the Assumed Average Weight per Person (AAWPP) calculated in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

        (d)(1) The AAWPP is 185 lb from December 1, 2011 until the AAWPP is first updated pursuant to the provisions of this section. As of the effective date of the first AAWPP update after December 1, 2011, this paragraph (d)(1) will be superseded and cease to be effective.

        (2) The formula in paragraph (e) of this section will be used to determine an update to the AAWPP. It requires the use of data in the most recent report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), or any successors to those centers. This report can be found on the CDC's Web site.

        (3) Each time the CDC releases a report containing mean weights of United States adult males and females, the Coast Guard will apply the formula in paragraph (e) of this section to that data. The resulting value will become the new AAWPP only if the sum equals or exceeds 10 pounds more than the AAWPP then in effect. The Coast Guard will notify the public of the new AAWPP in the  and other appropriate media.

        (4) Updates to the AAWPP used in calculations showing compliance with this subchapter will be promulgated as interpretive rules and become effective in accordance with the provisions of this section without further rulemaking procedures.

        (5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Coast Guard may choose, in its discretion, to conduct further rulemaking procedures at any time to amend this subchapter, including updates of the AAWPP.

        (6) Updates to the AAWPP used in calculations showing compliance with this subchapter will be published in a separate  notice and other appropriate media, except when the Coast Guard conducts further rulemaking procedures under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

        (7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Coast Guard may choose, in its discretion, to delay or dispense with any update of the AAWPP. In the event the Coast Guard elects to dispense with or delay an update that would otherwise issue as an interpretive rule pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Coast Guard will inform the public of the decision and explain the reasons in a  notice.

        (e) To obtain an AAWPP update, add the mean weight of all U.S. males aged 20 years and older to the mean weight of all U.S. females aged 20 years and older, and divide the sum by 2. To this average of the mean weights, add 7.5 pounds of assumed clothing weight, and round the resulting sum to the nearest whole number in pounds.

        (f) Updates to the AAWPP will become effective beginning one calendar year after publication in the  of a notice described in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(6) of this section, except the initial AAWPP issued pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section will become effective on December 1, 2011. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the Coast Guard may implement updates to the AAWPP at any time with less than one year of public notice when required for public safety reasons.

        (g) The most recent  notice that publishes the AAWPP as determined by this section is also on file at the Coast Guard Headquarters.

        (b) Each Class 1 door on a vessel in ocean service must be designed to withstand a head of water equivalent to the depth from the sill of the door to the margin line but in no case less than 10 feet (3.05 meters).

        (c) Each Class 2 and Class 3 door must—

        (1) Be designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.015);

        (2) Have controls in accordance with ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.015); and

        (3) If installed in a subdivision bulkhead, meet Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.015), unless the watertight doors are built in accordance with plans previously approved by the Coast Guard, in which case, only Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3.1.4 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.015) must be met. In either case, control systems for watertight doors must have power supplies, power sources, installation tests and inspection, and additional remote operating consoles in accordance with Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 through S4 of ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.015).

        (d) Installations of sliding watertight door assemblies must be in accordance with the following:

        (1) Before a sliding watertight door assembly is installed in a vessel, the bulkhead in the vicinity of the door opening must be stiffened. Such bulkhead stiffeners, or deck reinforcement where flush deck door openings are desired, must not be less than 6 inches nor more than 12 inches from the door frame so that an unstiffened diaphragm of bulkhead plating 6 to 12 inches wide is provided completely around the door frame. Where such limits cannot be maintained, alternative installations will be considered by the Marine Safety Center. In determining the scantlings of these bulkhead stiffeners, the door frame should not be considered as contributing to the strength of the bulkhead. Provision must also be made to adequately support the thrust bearings and other equipment that may be mounted on the bulkhead or deck.

        (2) Sliding watertight door frames must be either bolted or welded watertight to the bulkhead.

        (i) If bolted, a suitable thin heat and fire resistant gasket or suitable compound must be used between the bulkhead and the frame for watertightness. The bulkhead plating must be worked to a plane surface in way of the frame when mounting.

        (ii) If welded, caution must be exercised in the welding process so that the door frame is not distorted.

        (e) For each watertight door which is in a required subdivision bulkhead, an indicator light must be installed in the pilothouse and at each other vessel operating station from which the door is not visible. The indicator must show whether the door is open or closed.

        (c) If a Type I or II barge hull has an open hopper, the fully loaded barge must be shown by design calculations to have at least 2 inches (50mm) of positive GM when the hopper space is flooded to the height of the weather deck.

        (d) When demonstrating compliance with paragraph (c) of this section, credit may be given for the buoyancy of the immersed portion of cargo tanks if the tank securing devices are shown by design calculations to be strong enough to hold the tanks in place when they are subjected to the buoyant forces resulting from the water in the hopper.

        (e) Each tank barge must be shown by design calculations to have at least 2 inches (50 mm) of positive GM in each condition of loading and operation after assuming the damage specified in paragraph (f) of this section is applied in the following locations:

        (1)  If a Type I hull is required and the barge is not a box barge designed for use in an integrated tow, design calculations must show that the barge hull can survive damage at any location including on the intersection of a transverse and longitudinal watertight bulkhead.

        (2)  If a Type I hull is required and the barge is a box barge designed for operation in an integrated tow, design calculations must show that the barge can survive damage—

        (i) To any location on the bottom of the tank barge except on a transverse watertight bulkhead; and

        (ii) To any location on the side of the tank barge including on a transverse watertight bulkhead.

        (b)  Each tank vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the survival conditions in paragraph (g) of this section in each condition of loading and operation except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, assuming the damage specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c)  The design calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section need not be done for ballast conditions if the vessel is not carrying oil, other than oily residues, in cargo tanks.

        (d)  (1) If a tank vessel is longer than 738 feet (225 meters) in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location.

        (2) If a tank vessel is longer than 492 feet (150 meters) in length, but not longer than 738 feet (225 meters), design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location except the transverse bulkheads bounding an aft machinery space. The machinery space is calculated as a single floodable compartment.

        (3) If a tank vessel is 492 feet (150 meters) or less in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage—

        (i) At any location between adjacent main transverse watertight bulkheads except to an aft machinery space;

        (ii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead spaced closer than the longitudinal extent of collision penetration specified in Table 172.065(a) from another main transverse watertight bulkhead; and

        (iii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead or a transverse watertight bulkhead bounding a side tank or double bottom tank if there is a step or a recess in the transverse bulkhead that is longer than 10 feet (3.05 meters) and that is located within the extent of penetration of assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top is not a step for the purpose of this regulation.

        (e)  For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section—

        (1) Design calculations must include both side and bottom damage, applied separately; and

        (2) Damage must consist of the penetrations having the dimensions given in Table 172.065(a) except that, if the most disabling penetrations would be less than the penetrations described in this paragraph, the smaller penetration must be assumed.

        (f)  When doing the calculations required in paragraph (b) of this section—

        (1) The permeability of a floodable space, other than a machinery space, must be as listed in Table 172.065(b);

        (2) Calculations in which a machinery space is treated as a floodable space must be based on an assumed machinery space permeability of 85%, unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 85% is justified in detail; and

        (3) If a cargo tank would be penetrated under the assumed damage, the cargo tank must be assumed to lose all cargo and refill with salt water, or fresh water if the vessel operates solely on the Great Lakes, up to the level of the tank vessel's final equilibrium waterline.

        (g)  A vessel is presumed to survive assumed damage if it meets the following conditions in the final stage of flooding:

        (1)  The final waterline, in the final condition of sinkage, heel, and trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or an opening that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This opening does not include an opening closed by a—

        (i) Watertight manhole cover;

        (ii) Flush scuttle;

        (vi) Side scuttle of the non-opening type.

        (2)  The maximum angle of heel must not exceed 25 degrees, except that this angle may be increased to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs.

        (3)  Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its position of equilibrium after flooding, a tank vessel must meet the following conditions:

        (i) The righting arm curve must be positive.

        (ii) The maximum righting arm must be at least 3.94 inches (10 cm).

        (iii) Each submerged opening must be weathertight.

        (4)  Pipes, ducts or tunnels within the assumed extent of damage must be either—

        (i) Equipped with arrangements such as stop check valves to prevent progressive flooding to other spaces with which they connect; or

        (ii) Assumed in the design calculations required in paragraph (b) of this section to permit progressive flooding to the spaces with which they connect.

        (h)  For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section, the buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place.

#### § § 174.100

        (a) Appliances to insure watertight integrity include watertight doors, hatches, scuttles, bolted manhole covers, or other watertight closures for openings in watertight decks and bulkheads.

        (b) Appliances to insure weathertight integrity include weathertight doors and hatches, closures for air pipes, ventilators, ventilation intakes and outlets, and closures for other openings in deckhouses and superstructures.

        (c) Each internal opening equipped with appliances to insure watertight integrity that is used intermittently during operation of the unit while afloat must meet the following:

        (1) Each door, hatch, and scuttle must—

        (i) Be remotely controlled from a normally manned control station, and be operable locally from both sides of the bulkhead; or

        (ii) If there is no means of remote control there must be an alarm system that signals whether the appliance is open or closed both locally at each appliance and in a normally manned control station.

        (2) Each closing appliance must remain watertight under the design water pressure of the watertight boundary of which it is a part.

        (d) Each external opening fitted with an appliance to insure weathertight integrity must be located so that it would not be submerged below the final equilibrium waterline if the unit is subjected simultaneously to—

        (1) Damage causing flooding described in §§ 174.075 through 174.085; and

        (2) A wind heeling moment calculated in accordance with § 174.055 using a wind velocity of 50 knots (25.8 meters per second).

        (e) If a unit is equipped with sliding watertight doors, each sliding watertight door must—

        (1) Be designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007);

        (2) Have controls in accordance with ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007), except that a remote manual means of closure, as specified in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.5.1, and a remote mechanical indicator, as specified in paragraph 7.5.2, will not be required; and

        (3) If installed in a subdivision bulkhead, meet Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007), unless the watertight doors are built in accordance with plans previously approved by the Coast Guard, in which case, only Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3.1.4 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007) must be met. In either case, control systems for watertight doors must have power supplies, power sources, installation tests and inspection, and additional remote operating consoles in accordance with Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 through S4 of ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007).

        (f) Installations of sliding watertight door assemblies must be in accordance with the following:

        (1) Before a sliding watertight door assembly is installed in a vessel, the bulkhead in the vicinity of the door opening must be stiffened. Such bulkhead stiffeners, or deck reinforcement where flush deck door openings are desired, must not be less than 6 inches nor more than 12 inches from the door frame so that an unstiffened diaphragm of bulkhead plating 6 to 12 inches wide is provided completely around the door frame. Where such limits cannot be maintained, alternative installations will be considered by the Marine Safety Center. In determining the scantlings of these bulkhead stiffeners, the door frame should not be considered as contributing to the strength of the bulkhead. Provision must also be made to adequately support the thrust bearings and other equipment that may be mounted on the bulkhead or deck.

        (2) Sliding watertight door frames must be either bolted or welded watertight to the bulkhead.

        (i) If bolted, a suitable thin heat and fire resistant gasket or suitable compound must be used between the bulkhead and the frame for watertightness. The bulkhead plating shall be worked to a plane surface in way of the frame when mounting.

        (ii) If welded, caution must be exercised in the welding process so that the door frame is not distorted.

#### § § 175.118

      (a) The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA) contained an allowance for the exemption of certain passenger vessels that are—

      (1) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or

      (2) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons.

      (b) The owner or operator of a vessel must have applied for an exemption under PVSA by June 21, 1994, and then brought the vessel into compliance with the interim guidance in Navigation and Inspection Circular (NVIC) 7-94 not later than December 21, 1996. The PVSA exemption is valid for the service life of the vessel, as long as the vessel remains certified for passenger service. If the Certificate of Inspection (COI) is surrendered or otherwise becomes invalid (not including a term while the vessel is out of service but undergoing an inspection for recertification), the owner or operator must meet the appropriate inspection regulations to obtain a new COI without the PVSA exemption.

      (c) Except where the provisions of subchapter H of this chapter apply, the owner or operator must ensure that the vessel meets the requirements of this subchapter, meets any requirements the OCMI deems applicable, and meets any specific additions or exceptions as follows:

      (1) If a vessel does not meet the intact stability requirements of subchapter S of this chapter, the vessel's route(s) will be limited to an area within 20 nautical miles from a harbor of safe refuge, provided the vessel has a history of safe operation on those waters. The OCMI may further restrict the vessel's routes if the vessel's service history, condition, or other factors affect its seaworthiness or safety.

      (2) The vessel may not carry more than 150 passengers, and not more than 49 passengers in overnight accommodations.

      (3) The owner or operator must crew the vessel under the requirements of this subchapter. All officers must be endorsed for the appropriate vessel tonnage. The OCMI may require an appropriately endorsed engineer officer for those vessels of at least 200 gross tons. Vessels carrying more than 50 passengers must have an additional deckhand, and all deckhands on vessels carrying more than 50 passengers must be adequately trained. The crew members on a vessel of at least 200 gross tons, except those operated exclusively on lakes and rivers, are required to hold merchant mariner credentials or merchant mariner documents and 50 percent of the merchant mariner credentials or at least an able seaman.

      (4) The vessel owner or operator must comply with the lifesaving arrangements located in part 180 of this chapter, except that inflatable liferafts are required for primary lifesaving. A rescue boat or suitable rescue arrangement must be provided to the satisfaction of the OCMI.

      (5) The vessel owner or operator must comply with the fire protection requirements located in part 181 of this chapter. When a vessel fails to meet the fire protection and structural fire protection requirements of this subchapter, the vessel owner or operator must meet equivalent requirements to the satisfaction of the cognizant OCMI or submit plans for approval from the Coast Guard Marine Safety Center.

      (6) At a minimum, the owner or operator must outfit the vessel with portable fire extinguishers per 46 CFR 76.50. In addition, the vessel must meet any additional requirements of the OCMI, even if they exceed the requirements in 46 CFR 76.50.

      (7) In addition to the means-of-escape requirements of 46 CFR 177.500, the vessel owner or operator must also meet the requirements for means of escape found in 46 CFR 78.47-40.

      (d) The OCMI conducts an inspection and may issue a COI if the vessel meets these requirements. The COI's condition of operation must contain the following endorsement: “This vessel is operating under an exemption afforded in The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 and as such is limited to domestic voyages and a maximum ______ of passengers and may be subject to additional regulations and restrictions as provided for in Sections 511 and 512 of the Act.”

      § 175.200   Gross tonnage as criterion for requirements.

#### § § 175.200

      (a) The regulations in this subchapter take into account a vessel's length, passenger capacity, construction, equipment, intended service, and operating area. The criterion for application of this subchapter is the gross tonnage of the vessel. When the Commandant determines that the gross tonnage of a particular vessel, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be incompatible with the application of specific regulations for a vessel of such physical size, the Commandant will prescribe the regulations to be made applicable to the vessel.

      (b) When the Commandant determines that the gross tonnage is not a valid criterion for the use of certain regulations based on the relative size of the vessel, the owner will be informed of the determination and of the regulations applicable to the vessel. The vessel must be brought into compliance with all additional requirements before a Certificate of Inspection is issued.

Requests for approval must be submitted to the Marine Safety Center via the cognizant OCMI. If necessary, the Marine Safety Center may require engineering evaluations and tests to demonstrate the equivalence of the substitute.

      (b) The Commandant may accept compliance by a high speed craft with the provisions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) “Code of Safety for High Speed Craft” as an equivalent to compliance with applicable requirements of this subchapter. Requests for a determination of equivalency for a particular vessel must be submitted to the Marine Safety Center via the cognizant OCMI.

      (c) The Commandant may approve a novel lifesaving appliance or arrangement as an equivalent if it has performance characteristics at least equivalent to the appliance or arrangement required under this part, and:

      (1) Is evaluated and tested under IMO Resolution A. 520(13) (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600); or

      (2) Has successfully undergone an evaluation and tests that are substantially equivalent to those recommendations.

      (d) The Commandant may accept alternative compliance arrangements in lieu of specific provisions of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code (IMO Resolution A.741(18)) for the purpose of determining that an equivalent safety management system is in place on board a vessel. The Commandant will consider the size and corporate structure of a vessel's company when determining the acceptability of an equivalent system. Requests for determination of equivalency must be submitted to Commandant (CG-CVC) via the cognizant OCMI.

        § 176.110   Routes permitted.

#### § § 176.110

        (a) The area of operation for each vessel and any necessary operational limits are determined by the cognizant OCMI, and recorded on the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. Each area of operation, referred to as a route, is described on the Certificate of Inspection under the major headings “Oceans,” “Coastwise,” “Limited Coastwise,” “Great Lakes,” “Lakes, Bays, and Sounds,” or “Rivers,” as applicable. Further limitations imposed or extensions granted are described by reference to bodies of waters, geographical points, distance from geographical points, distances from land, depths of channel, seasonal limitations, and similar factors.

        (b) Operation of a vessel on a route of lesser severity than those specifically described or designated on the Certificate of Inspection is permitted unless expressly prohibited on the Certificate of Inspection. The general order of severity of routes is: oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, Great Lakes, lakes, bays, and sounds, and rivers. The cognizant OCMI may prohibit a vessel from operating on a route of lesser severity than the primary route a vessel is authorized to operate on if local conditions necessitate such a restriction.

        (c) Non-self-propelled vessels are prohibited from operating on an oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, or Great Lakes route unless the Commandant approves such a route.

        (d) When designating a permitted route or imposing any operational limits on a vessel, the OCMI may consider:

        (1) Requirements of this subchapter for which compliance is based on the route of the vessel;

        (2) The performance capabilities of the vessel based on design, scantlings, stability, subdivision, propulsion, speed, operating modes, maneuverability, and other characteristics;

        (3) The suitability of the vessel for nighttime operations; and

        (4) The suitability of the vessel for all environmental conditions.

        § 176.112   Total persons permitted.

#### § § 176.112

        The cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) determines the total number of persons permitted to be carried on a vessel. In determining the total number of persons, the OCMI may consider the total weight of passengers, crew, and variable loads; stability restrictions and subdivision requirements of the vessel; the vessel's route, general arrangement, means of escape, and lifesaving equipment; minimum manning requirements; and the maximum number of passengers permitted in accordance with § 176.113 of this part.

> [USCG-2007-0030, 75 FR 78087, Dec. 14, 2010]

        § 176.113   Passengers permitted.

#### § § 176.113

        (a) The maximum number of passengers permitted must be not more than that allowed by the requirements of this section, except as authorized by the OCMI under paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) The maximum number of passengers permitted on any vessel may be the greatest number permitted by the length of rail criterion, deck area criterion, or fixed seating criterion described in this paragraph or a combination of these criteria as allowed by paragraph (c) of this section.

        (1)  One passenger may be permitted for each 760 millimeters (30 inches) of rail space available to the passengers at the periphery of each deck. The following rail space may not be used in determining the maximum number of passengers permitted:

        (i) Rail space in congested areas unsafe for passengers, such as near anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, in the way of sail booms, running rigging, or paddle wheels, or along pulpits;

        (ii) Rail space on stairways; and

        (iii) Rail space where persons standing in the space would block the vision of the individual operating the vessel.

        (2)  One passenger may be permitted for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area available for the passengers' use. In computing such deck area, the areas occupied by the following must be excluded;

        (i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criteria;

        (ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;

        (iii) Toilets and washrooms;

        (iv) Spaces occupied by and necessary for handling lifesaving equipment, anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, or in the way of sail booms or running rigging;

        (v) Spaces below deck that are unsuitable for passengers or that would not normally be used by passengers;

        (vi) Interior passageways less than 840 millimeters (34 inches) wide and passageways on open deck, less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;

        (vii) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms and areas that do not have a solid deck, such as netting on multi-hull vessels;

        (viii) Deck areas in way of paddle wheels; and

        (ix) Aisle area provided in accordance with § 177.820(d) in this subchapter.

        (3)  One passenger may be permitted for each 455 millimeter (18 inches) of width of fixed seating provided by § 177.820 of this subchapter. Each sleeping berth in overnight accommodation spaces shall be counted as only one seat.

        (c) Different passenger capacity criteria may be used on each deck of a vessel and added together to determine the total passenger capacity of that vessel. Where seats are provided on part of a deck and not on another, the number of passengers permitted on a vessel may be the sum of the number permitted by the seating criterion for the space having seats and the number permitted by the deck area criterion for the space having no seats. The length of rail criterion may not be combined with either the deck area criterion or the fixed seating criterion when determining the maximum number of passengers permitted on an individual deck.

        (d) For a vessel operating on short runs on protected waters such as a ferry, the cognizant OCMI may give special consideration to increases in passenger allowances.

If the vessel becomes due for a drydock examination or an internal structural examination during the voyage, it may lawfully complete the voyage prior to the examination if it undergoes the required examination upon completion of the voyage to the United States but not later than 30 days after the examination was due. If the vessel is due for an examination within 15 days of sailing on an international voyage from the United States port, it must undergo the required examination before sailing.

        (c) If your vessel is not operated on international voyages and does not meet the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section, it must undergo a drydock and internal structural examination as follows unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per § 176.615 of this part:

        (1) A vessel that is exposed to salt water more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural at least once every two years; and

        (2) A vessel that is exposed to salt water not more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural examination at least once every five years.

        (d) Whenever damage or deterioration to hull plating or structural members that may affect the seaworthiness of a vessel is discovered or suspected, the cognizant OCMI may conduct an internal structural examination in any affected space including fuel tanks, and may require the vessel to be drydocked or taken out of service to assess the extent of the damage, and to effect permanent repairs. The OCMI may also decrease the drydock examination intervals to monitor the vessel's structural condition.

        (e) For a vessel that is eligible per § 115.625, and if the owner opts for an alternate hull examination with the underwater survey portion conducted exclusively by divers, the vessel must undergo two alternate hull exams and two internal structural exams within any five-year period. If a vessel completes a satisfactory alternate hull exam, with the underwater survey portion conducted predominantly by an approved underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the vessel must undergo one alternate hull and one internal structural exam, within any five-year period. The vessel may undergo a drydock exam to satisfy any of the required alternate hull exams.

        § 176.620   Description of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program for certain passenger vessels.

#### § § 176.620

        The Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program provides you with an alternative to a drydock examination by allowing your vessel's hull to be examined while it remains afloat. If completed using only divers, this program has four steps: the application process, the preliminary examination, the pre-survey meeting, and the hull examination. If the vessel is already participating in the program, or if a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is used during the program, the preliminary exam step may be omitted. Once you complete these steps, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), will evaluate the results and accept the examination as a credit hull exam if the vessel is in satisfactory condition. If only divers are used for the underwater survey portion of the examination process, you may receive credit for a period of time such that subsequent AHEs would be conducted at intervals of twice in every five years, with no more than three years between any two AHEs. The OCMI may waive an underwater survey in accordance with § 176.655(d) provided that the interval does not exceed five years between any two underwater surveys. If an underwater ROV is used as the predominate method to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you may receive credit up to five years. At the end of this period, you may apply for further participation under the AHE Program.

        § 176.650   Alternative Hull Examination Program options: Divers or underwater ROV.

#### § § 176.650

        To complete the underwater survey portion of the AHE, you may use divers or an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV).

        (a) If you use divers to conduct the underwater survey, you must—

        (1) Locate the vessel so the divers can work safely under the vessel's keel and around both sides. The water velocity must be safe for dive operations;

        (2) Provide permanent hull markings, a temporary grid system of wires or cables spaced not more than 10 feet apart and tagged at one-foot intervals, or any other acoustic or electronic positioning system approved by the OCMI to identify the diver's location with respect to the hull, within one foot of accuracy;

        (3) Take ultrasonic thickness gaugings at a minimum of 5 points on each plate, evenly spaced;

        (4) Take hull plating thickness gaugings along transverse belts at the bow, stern, and midships, as a minimum. Plating thickness gaugings must also be taken along a longitudinal belt at the wind and water strake. Individual gaugings along the transverse and longitudinal belts must be spaced no more than 3 feet apart;

        (5) Ensure the third party examiner observes the entire underwater examination process;

        (6) Record the entire underwater survey with audio and video recording equipment and ensure that communications between divers and the third party examiner are recorded; and

        (7) Use appropriate equipment, such as a clear box, if underwater visibility is poor, to provide the camera with a clear view of the hull.

        (b) You may use an underwater ROV to conduct the underwater survey. The underwater ROV operating team, survey process and equipment, quality assurance methods, and the content and format of the survey report must be accepted by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) prior to the survey. If you choose this option, you must—

        (1) Locate the vessel to ensure that the underwater ROV can operate effectively under the vessel's keel and around both sides; and

        (2) Employ divers to examine any sections of the hull and appurtenances that the underwater ROV cannot access or is otherwise unable to evaluate.

        (3) If the OCMI determines that the data obtained by the ROV, including non-destructive testing results, readability of the results, and positioning standards, will not integrate into the data obtained by the divers, then a third party examiner must be present during the divers portion of the examination.

> [USCG-2000-6858, 67 FR 21086, Apr. 29, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 47384, Aug. 5, 2004]

        § 176.655   Hull examination reports.

#### § § 176.655

        (a) If you use only divers for the underwater survey portion of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE), you must provide the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), with a written hull examination report. This report must include thickness gauging results, bearing clearances, a copy of the audio and video recordings, and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for a credit hull exam. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.

        (b) If you use an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as the predominate means to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you must provide the OCMI with a report in a format that is acceptable to the OCMI, per § 176.650(b) of this part.

        (c) The OCMI will evaluate the hull examination report and grant a credit hull exam if satisfied with the condition of the vessel. If approved and you exclusively use divers to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 36 months. (Underwater examinations are required twice every 5 years.) If approved and you use an underwater ROV as the predominate means to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 60 months (5 years).

        (d) At least 60 days prior to each scheduled underwater exam, the owner may request a waiver from the OCMI if:

        (1) A satisfactory exam has been completed within the last three years;

        (2) The conditions during the last exam allowed at least 80 percent of the bottom surface to be viewed and recorded; and

        (3) The results of the last exam indicated that an extended interval is safe and reasonable.

#### § § 176.660

        (a) To continue to participate in the AHE Program, vessel operators must conduct an annual hull condition assessment. At a minimum, vessel operators must conduct an internal examination and take random hull gaugings internally during the hull condition assessment, unless waived by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If the annual hull assessment reveals significant damage or corrosion, where temporary repairs have been made, or where other critical areas of concern have been identified, the OCMI may require an expanded examination to include an underwater hull examination using divers. If an underwater examination is required, the examination must focus on areas at higher risk of damage or corrosion and must include a representative sampling of hull gaugings.

        (b) If an underwater survey is required for the annual hull condition assessment, the OCMI may require the presence of a third party examiner and a written hull examination report must be submitted to the OCMI. This report must include thickness gauging results, a copy of the audio and video recordings and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for continued participation in the AHE program. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.

        (c) You must submit your preventive maintenance reports or checklists on an annual basis to the OCMI. These reports or checklists must conform to the plans you submitted in your application under § 176.630 of this part, which the OCMI approved.

        (d) Prior to each scheduled annual hull condition assessment—

        (1) The owner may submit to the OCMI a plan for conducting the assessment, or a request for a waiver of this requirement, no fewer than 30 days before the scheduled assessment; and

        (2) The OCMI may reduce the scope or extend the interval of the assessment if the operational, casualty, and deficiency history of the vessel, along with a recommendation of the vessel's master, indicates that it is warranted.

        § 177.500   Means of escape.

#### § § 177.500

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each space accessible to passengers or used by the crew on a regular basis, must have at least two means of escape, one of which must not be a watertight door.

        (b) The two required means of escape must be widely separated and, if possible, at opposite ends or sides of the space to minimize the possibility of one incident blocking both escapes.

        (c) Subject to the restrictions of this section, means of escape may include normal exits and emergency exits, passageways, stairways, ladders, deck scuttles, and windows.

        (d) The number and dimensions of the means of escape from each space must be sufficient for rapid evacuation in an emergency for the number of persons served. In determining the number of persons served, a space must be considered to contain at least the number of persons as follows:

        (1) Passenger overnight accommodation spaces: Designed capacity;

        (2) Accommodation spaces having fixed seating for passengers: Maximum seating capacity;

        (3) Public spaces, including spaces such as casinos, restaurants, club rooms, and cinemas, and public accommodation spaces as defined in § 175.400 of this subchapter, except overnight accommodation spaces: One person may be permitted for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area. In computing such deck area, the following areas must be excluded:

        (i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criterion;

        (ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;

        (j) A ladder leading to a deck scuttle may not be used as a means of escape except:

        (1) On a vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length, a vertical ladder and a deck scuttle may be used as not more than one of the means of escape from passenger accommodation space; or

        (2) As not more than one of the means of escape from any crew accommodation space or work space.

        (k) Each ladder used as a means of escape must be mounted at least 180 millimeters (7 inches) from the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder. Rungs must be:

        (1) At least 405 millimeters (16 inches) in width; and

        (2) Not more than 305 millimeters (12 inches) apart, and uniformly spaced for the length of the ladder with at least 114 millimeters (4.5 inches) clearance above each rung.

        (l) When a deck scuttle serves as a means of escape, it must not be less than 455 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter and must be fitted with a quick acting release and a holdback device to hold the scuttle in an open position.

        (m) Footholds, handholds, ladders, and similar means provided to aid escape, must be suitable for use in emergency conditions, of rigid construction, and permanently fixed in position, unless they can be folded, yet brought into immediate service in an emergency.

        (n) Vessels described by 46 CFR 175.110(d) must ensure that the two means of escape required in paragraph (b) of this section are unobstructed and the door, hatch, or scuttle is not located directly above, or dependent on, a berth.

        (o) On a vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length, a window or windshield of sufficient size and proper accessibility may be used as one of the required means of escape from an enclosed space, provided it:

        (1) Does not lead directly overboard;

        (2) Can be opened or is designed to be kicked or pushed out; and

        (3) Is suitably marked.

        (p) Only one means of escape is required from a space where:

        (1) The space has a deck area less than 30 square meters (322 square feet);

        (2) There is no stove, heater, or other source of fire in the space;

        (3) The means of escape is located as far as possible from a machinery space or fuel tank; and

        (6) On a non-sailing flush deck catamaran that is propelled by mechanical means, not more than one-third of the freeboard or one-third of the draft, whichever is less, may be immersed.

        (7) In no case may the angle of heel exceed 14 degrees.

        (e) The limits of heel must be measured at:

        (1) The point of minimum freeboard; or

        (2) At a point three-quarters of the vessel's length from the bow if the point of minimum freeboard is aft of this point.

        (f) When demonstrating compliance with paragraph (d) of this section, the freeboard must be measured as follows:

        (1) For a flush deck or well deck vessel, the freeboard must be measured to the top of the weatherdeck at the side of the vessel; and

        (2) For a cockpit vessel or for an open boat, the freeboard must be measured to the top of the gunwale.

        (g) A ferry must also be tested in a manner acceptable to the cognizant OCMI to determine whether the trim or heel during loading or unloading will submerge the deck edge. A ferry passes this test if, with the total number of passengers and the maximum vehicle weight permitted on board, the deck edge is not submerged during loading or unloading of the vessel.

If fuel can drain from a space being protected to an adjacent space or if the spaces are not entirely separate, the volume of both spaces must be used to determine the quantity of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon dioxide must be arranged to discharge into both such spaces simultaneously.

        (ii) The minimum size of a branch line to a space must be as noted in Table 181.410(f)(4)(ii).

        (iii) Distribution piping within a space must be proportioned from the distribution line to give proper supply to the outlets without throttling.

        (iv) The number, type, and location of discharge outlets must provide uniform distribution of carbon dioxide throughout a space.

        (v) The total area of all discharge outlets must not exceed 85 percent nor be less than 35 percent of the nominal cylinder outlet area or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller. The nominal cylinder outlet area in square millimeters (inches) is determined by multiplying the factor 0.015 (0.0022 if using square inches) by the total capacity in kilograms (pounds) of all carbon dioxide cylinders in the system, except in no case must the outlet area be of less than 71 square millimeters (0.110 square inches if using pounds).

        (vi) The discharge of at least 85 percent of the required amount of carbon dioxide must be completed within two minutes.

In addition, there must be sufficient carbon dioxide available to permit delayed discharges to maintain at least a 25 percent concentration until the equipment can be stopped. If the initial discharge achieves this concentration, a delayed discharge is not required.

        (ii) The piping sizes for the initial discharge must be in accordance with Table 181.410(f)(4)(ii) and the discharge of the required amount must be completed within two minutes.

        (iii) Piping for the delayed discharge must not be less than 12.7 millimeters (0.5 inches) nominal pipe size, and need not meet specific requirement for discharge rate.

        (iv) Piping for the delayed discharge may be incorporated with the initial discharge piping.

        (ii) System piping must be of at least 19 millimeters (0.75 inches).

        (iii) No specific discharge rate is required.

        (7) A lockout valve must be provided on any carbon dioxide extinguishing system protecting a space over 6,000 cubic feet in volume and installed or altered after [July 9, 2013. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.

        (i) The lockout valve must be a manually operated valve located in the discharge manifold prior to the stop valve or selector valves. When in the closed position, the lockout valve must provide complete isolation of the system from the protected space or spaces, making it impossible for carbon dioxide to discharge in the event of equipment failure during maintenance.

        (ii) The lockout valve design or locking mechanism must make it obvious whether the valve is open or closed.

        (iii) A valve is considered a lockout valve if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which, a lock can be affixed, or it has a locking mechanism built into it.

        (iv) The master or person-in-charge must ensure that the valve is locked open at all times, except while maintenance is being performed on the extinguishing system, when the valve must be locked in the closed position.

        (v) Lockout valves added to existing systems must be approved by the Commandant as part of the installed system.

        (8) Each carbon dioxide extinguishing system installed or altered after July 9, 2013, must have an approved odorizing unit to produce the scent of wintergreen, the detection of which will serve as an indication that carbon dioxide gas is present in a protected area and any other area into which the carbon dioxide may migrate. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.

        (g)  (1) A custom engineering fixed gas fire extinguishing system, which uses Halon 1301, must comply with the applicable sections of UL 1058 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600) and the requirements of this paragraph (g).

        (2) The Halon 1301 quantity and discharge requirements of UL 1058 apply, with the exception that the Halon 1301 design concentration must be 6 percent at the lowest ambient temperature expected in the space. If the lowest temperature is not known, a temperature of −18 °C (0 °F) must be assumed.

        (3) Each storage cylinder in a system must have the same pressure and volume.

        (4) Computer programs used in designing systems must have been approved by an independent laboratory.

Where fuel level gauges are used on a metal tank, the flanges to which gauge fittings are attached must be welded or brazed to the tank. No tubular gauge glasses may be fitted to gasoline fuel tanks. Tubular gauge glasses, if fitted to diesel fuel tanks, must be of heat resistant materials, adequately protected from mechanical damage, and provided at the tank connections with devices that will automatically close in the event of rupture of the gauge or gauge lines.

        (8) A metal tank exceeding 760 millimeters (30 inches) in any horizontal dimension must:

        (i) Be fitted with vertical baffle plates, which meet subparagraph (a)(9) of this section, at intervals not exceeding 760 millimeters (30 inches) to provide strength and to control the excessive surge of fuel; or

        (ii) The owner must submit calculations to the cognizant OCMI demonstrating the structural adequacy of the tank in a fully loaded static condition and in a worst case dynamic (sloshing) condition.

        (9) Baffle plates, where required in metal tanks, must be of the same material and not less than the minimum thickness required in the tank walls and must be connected to the tank walls by welding or brazing. Limber holes at the bottom and air holes at the top of all baffles must be provided.

        (10) Iron or steel diesel fuel tanks must not be galvanized on the interior. Galvanizing, paint, or other suitable coating must be used to protect the outside of iron and steel diesel fuel tanks and the inside and outside of iron and steel gasoline fuel tanks.

        (b)  Independent fuel tanks must be located and installed as described in this paragraph (b).

        (1) Fuel tanks must be located in, or as close as practicable to, machinery spaces.

        (2) Fuel tanks and fittings must be so installed as to permit examination, testing, or removal for cleaning with minimum disturbance to the hull structure.

        (4) All fuel tanks must be electrically bonded to a common ground.

        (c)  Independent fuel tanks must be tested as described in this paragraph (c) prior to being used to carry fuel.

        (1) Prior to installation, tanks vented to the atmosphere must be hydrostatically tested to, and must withstand, a pressure of 35 kPa (5 psig) or 11/2 times the maximum pressure head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater. A standpipe of 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in height attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 35 kPa (5 psig) test. Permanent deformation of the tank will not be cause for rejection unless accompanied by leakage.

        (2) After installation of the fuel tank on a vessel, the complete installation must be tested in the presence of a marine inspector, or individual specified by the cognizant OCMI, to a heat not less than that to which the tank may be subjected in service. Fuel may be used as the testing medium.

        (3) All tanks not vented to the atmosphere must be constructed and tested in accordance with 46 CFR 182.330.

        (d)  A vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length carrying not more than 12 passengers, with independent gasoline fuel tanks built in accordance with ABYC H-24 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600), or 33 CFR 183, subpart J, or with independent diesel fuel tanks built in accordance with ABYC H-33 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600), will be considered as meeting the requirements of this section. However, tanks must not be fabricated from any material not listed in Table 182.440(a)(1) without approval by the Commandant under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

#### § § 182.460

        (a) A space containing machinery powered by, or fuel tanks for, gasoline must have a ventilation system that complies with this section and consists of:

        (1) For an enclosed space:

        (i) At least two natural ventilation supply ducts located at one end of the space and that extend to the lowest part of the space or to the bilge on each side of the space; and

        (ii) A mechanical exhaust system consisting of at least two ventilation exhaust ducts located at the end of the space opposite from where the supply ducts are fitted, which extend to the lowest part of the bilge of the space on each side of the space, and which are led to one or more powered exhaust blowers; and

        (2) For a partially enclosed space, at least one ventilation duct installed in the forward part of the space and one ventilation duct installed in the after part of the space, or as otherwise required by the cognizant OCMI. Ducts for partially enclosed spaces must have cowls or scoops as required by paragraph (i) of this section.

        (b) A mechanical exhaust system required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section must be such as to assure the air changes as noted in Table 182.460(b) depending upon the size of the space.

        (c) An exhaust blower motor may not be installed in a duct, and if mounted in any space required to be ventilated by this section, must be located as high above the bilge as practicable. Blower blades must be nonsparking with reference to their housings.

        (d) Where a fixed gas fire extinguishing system is installed in a space, all powered exhaust blowers for the space must automatically shut down upon release of the extinguishing agent.

        (e) Exhaust blower switches must be located outside of any space required to be ventilated by this section, and must be of the type interlocked with the starting switch and the ignition switch so that the blowers are started before the engine starter motor circuit or the engine ignition is energized. A red warning sign at the switch must state that the blowers must be operated prior to starting the engines for the time sufficient to insure at least one complete change of air in the space served.

        (f) The area of the ventilation ducts must be sufficient to limit the air velocity to a maximum of 10 meters per second (2,000 feet per minute). A duct may be of any shape, provided that in no case will one cross sectional dimension exceed twice the other.

        (g) A duct must be so installed that ordinary collection of water in the bilge will not block vapor flow.

        (h) A duct must be of rigid permanent construction, which does not allow any appreciable vapor flow except through normal openings, and made of the same material as the hull or of noncombustible material. The duct must lead as directly as possible from its intake opening to its terminus and be securely fastened and supported.

        (i) A supply duct must be provided at its intake opening with a cowl or scoop having a free area not less than twice the required duct area. When the cowl or scoop is screened, the mouth area must be increased to compensate for the area of the screen wire. A cowl or scoop must be kept open at all times except when the weather is such as to endanger the vessel if the openings are not temporarily closed.

        (j) Dampers may not be fitted in a supply duct.

        (a) The provisions of this subpart, with the exception of § 193.10-90, shall apply to all vessels contracted for on or after March 1, 1968.

        (b) Vessels contracted for prior to March 1, 1968, shall meet the requirements of § 193.10-90.

        § 193.10-5   Fire pumps.

#### § § 193.10-5

        (a) Vessels must be equipped with independently driven fire pumps in accordance with Table 193.10-5(a) of this section.

        (b) On vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more on an international voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water through the fire main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by paragraph (c) of this section, must have a minimum capacity of at least two-thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump. However, in no case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.

        (c) Each pump must be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the outlets having the greatest pressure drop from the fire pumps to the nozzles which may not always be the two highest outlets, at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. Where 1 -inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2 -inch hose by footnote 2 of Table 193.10-5(a), the pump capacity must be determined on the same basis as if 2 -inch hose had been permitted. Where  -inch hose is permitted by Table 193.10-5(a), the Pitot tube pressure may not be less than 35 p.s.i.

        (d) Fire pumps must be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or 125 p.s.i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shutoff conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.

        (e) Fire pumps must be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.

        (f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case may a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash must be so arranged that adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting purposes.

        (g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump must not be less than the discharge area of the pump.

        (h) Where two fire pumps are required on vessels with main or auxiliary oil-fired boilers or with internal combustion propulsion machinery, the pumps must be located in separate spaces. The pumps, sea connections, and sources of power must be arranged to ensure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement, the installation of a fixed fire extinguishing system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that would affect the powering and operation for the required fire pumps.

        (i) Except as provided for in § 193.10-10(e), a sufficient number of hose streams for fire fighting purposes must be immediately available from the fire main at all times by either of the following methods:

        (1)  (i) Water pressure must be maintained on the fire main at all times by the continuous operation of:

        (A) One of the fire pumps; or

        (B) Another suitable pump capable of supplying one hose stream at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (35 p.s.i. for  -inch hose); or,

        (C) A pressure tank capable of supplying one hose stream at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (35 p.s.i. for  -inch hose) for five minutes.

        (ii) An audible alarm must be installed to sound in a continuously manned space if the pressure in the fire main drops to less than that necessary to maintain the minimum Pitot tube pressures specified in § 193.10-5(i)(1)(i)(B).

        (2)  (i) At least one fire pump must be capable of remote activation and control.

        (ii) If the fire pump is in a continuously manned machinery space, the controls for operating it and the controls for all necessary valves must be located on the manned operating platform in that space.

        (iii) If the fire pump is in an unmanned machinery space, the controls for its operation and the controls for all necessary valves must be located in:

        (A) The fire control station, if any; or,

        (B) The bridge, if there is no fire control station; or,

        (C) A readily accessible space acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

        § 193.10-10   Fire hydrants and hose.

#### § § 193.10-10

        (a) The size of fire hydrants, hose, and nozzles and the length of hose required must be as noted in Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart.

        (b) In 2 -inch hose and hydrants specified in Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart, on vessels of more than 1,500 gross tons, the hydrants in interior locations may have wye connections for 1 -inch hose. In these cases, the hose must be 75 feet (22.86 meters) in length, and only one hose will be required at each fire station; however, if all such stations can be satisfactorily served with 50-foot lengths, 50-foot hose may be used. The hydrants for exterior locations may substitute two 1 -inch outlets, each with a 1 -inch hose, supplied through a wye connection.

        (c) On vessels of 500 gross tons or more there must be at least one shore connection to the fire main available to each side of the vessel in an accessible location. Suitable cutout valves and check valves must be provided for furnishing the vessel's shore connections with couplings mating those on the shore fire lines. Vessels of 500 gross tons or more on an international voyage, must be provided with at least one international shore connection complying with ASTM F 1121 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.01-3). Facilities must be available enabling an international shore connection to be used on either side of the vessel.

        (d) Fire hydrants must be of sufficient number and so located that any part of the vessel, other than main machinery spaces, may be reached with at least 2 streams of water from separate outlets, at least one of which must be from a single length of hose. In main machinery spaces, all portions of such spaces must be capable of being reached by at least 2 streams of water, each of which must be from a single length of hose from separate outlets; however, this requirement need not apply to shaft alleys containing no assigned space for the stowage of combustibles. Fire hydrants must be numbered as required by § 196.37-15 of this subchapter.

        (e) All parts of the fire main located on exposed decks must either be protected against freezing or be fitted with cutout valves and drain valves so that the entire exposed parts of such piping may be shut off and drained in freezing weather. Except when closed to prevent freezing, such valves must be sealed open.

        (f) The outlet at the fire hydrant must be limited to any position from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward, so that the hose will lead horizontally or downward to minimize the possibility of kinking.

        (g) Each fire hydrant must be provided with a single length of hose with nozzle attached and a spanner wrench. A suitable hose rack or other device must be provided for the proper stowage of the hose. If the hose is not stowed in the open or behind glass so as to be readily seen, the enclosures must be marked in accordance with § 196.37-15 of this subchapter.

        (h) Firehoses must be connected to the outlets at all times. However, at open decks where no protection is afforded to the hose in heavy weather, the hose may be temporarily removed from the hydrant and stowed in an accessible nearby location.

        (i) Each fire hydrant must have at least 1 length of firehose. Each firehose must have a combination solid stream and water spray nozzle that is approved under subpart 162.027 of this subchapter, except 19 millimeters (3/4 inch) hose may have a garden hose nozzle that is bronze or metal with strength and corrosion resistance equivalent to bronze. Combination solid stream and water spray nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

        (j) When the firehose nozzle in the below locations was previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter, a low-velocity water spray applicator, also previously approved under subpart 162.027, of this chapter must be installed as follows:

        (1) At least 1 length of firehose on each fire hydrant outside and in the immediate vicinity of each laboratory; and

        (2) Each firehose in each propulsion machinery space containing oil-fired boiler, internal combustion machinery, or oil fuel unit on a vessel of 1,000 gross tons or more—the length of each applicator must be 1.2 meters (4 feet).

        (k) Fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing an applicator must be next to each fire hydrant that has an applicator under paragraph (j) of this section.

        (l) Firehose must not be used for any other purpose than fire extinguishing, drills, and testing.

        (m) Fire hydrants, nozzles, and other fittings must have threads to accommodate the hose connections noted in this paragraph. Firehose and couplings must be as follows:

        (1) Couplings must be of brass, bronze, or other equivalent metal. National Standard firehose coupling threads must be used for the 1 -inch and 2 -inch sizes, , 9 threads per inch for 1 -inch hose and 7  threads per inch for 2 -inch hose.

        (2) Unlined hose must not be used in the machinery spaces.

        (3) Where  -inch hose is permitted by Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart, the hose and couplings must be of good commercial grade.

        (4) Each section of firehose used after January 1, 1980 must be lined commercial firehose that conforms to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. Standard 19 or Federal Specification ZZ-H-451E. Hose that bears the label of Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. as lined firehose is accepted as conforming to this requirement. Each section of replacement firehose or any section of new firehose placed aboard a vessel after January 1, 1977 must also conform to the specification required by this paragraph.

      Subpart 193.15—Carbon Dioxide and Clean Agent Extinguishing Systems, Details

        § 193.15-1   Application.

#### § § 193.15-1

        (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all new installations contracted for on or after March 1, 1968.

        (b) Installations contracted for prior to March 1, 1968, shall meet the requirements of § 193.15-90.

        (c) The requirements of this subpart are based on a “high pressure system,” , one in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form at atmospheric temperature. Details for “low pressure systems,” , those in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form at a continuously controlled low temperature, may be specifically approved by the Commandant where it is demonstrated that a comparable degree of safety and fire extinguishing ability is achieved.

        § 193.15-5   Quantity, pipe sizes, and discharge rates.

#### § § 193.15-5

        (a)  The amount of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be as determined by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

        (b)  A separate supply of carbon dioxide need not be provided for each space protected. The total available supply shall be at least sufficient for the space requiring the greatest amount.

        (c)  (1) The number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for the initial charge shall be equal to the gross volume of the system divided by 10 for systems having a volume of less than 2,000 cubic feet, and divided by 12 for systems having a volume of 2,000 cubic feet or more.

        (2) In addition to the amount required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section there shall be sufficient carbon dioxide available to permit delayed discharges of such quantity as to maintain at least a 25-percent concentration until the equipment can be stopped. If the initial discharge is such as to achieve this concentration until the equipment is stopped, no delayed discharge need be provided.

        (3) The piping for the delayed discharge shall not be less than  -inch standard pipe, and no specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems. On small systems, this pipe may be incorporated with the initial discharge piping.

        (4) The piping for the initial charge shall be in accordance with Table 193.15-5(d)(4), and the discharge of the required amount shall be completed within 2 minutes.

        (d)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor noted in Table 193.15-5(d)(1). If fuel can drain from the compartment being protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon dioxide shall be arranged to discharge into both such compartments simultaneously.

        (2) For the purpose of the requirements of this paragraph, the volume of the machinery space shall be taken as exclusive of the normal machinery casing unless the boiler, internal combustion machinery, or fuel oil installations extend into such space, in which case the volume shall be taken to the top of the casing or the next material reduction in casing area, whichever is lower. “Normal machinery casing” and “material reduction in casing area” shall be defined as follows:

        (i) By “normal machinery casing” shall be meant a casing the area of which is not more than 40 percent of the maximum area of the machinery space.

        (ii) By “material reduction in casing area” shall be meant a reduction to at least 40 percent of the casing area.

        (3) For vessels on an international voyage contracted for on or after May 26, 1965, the amount of carbon dioxide required for a space containing propulsion boilers or internal combustion propulsion machinery shall be as given by paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section or by dividing the entire volume, including the casing, by a factor of 25, whichever is the larger.

        (4) Branch lines to the various spaces shall be as noted in Table 193.15-5(d)(4).

        (5) Distribution piping within the space shall be proportioned from the supply line to give proper distribution to the outlets without throttling.

        (6) The number, type, and location of discharge outlets shall be such as to give a uniform distribution throughout the space.

        (7) The total area of all discharge outlets shall not exceed 85 percent nor be less than 35 percent of the normal cylinder outlet area or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller. The nominal cylinder outlet area in square inches shall be determined by multiplying the factor 0.0022 by the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required, except that in no case shall this outlet area be less than 0.110 square inch.

        (8) The discharge of at least 85 percent of the required amount of carbon dioxide shall be complete within 2 minutes.

        § 193.15-10   Controls.

#### § § 193.15-10

        (a) Except as noted in § 193.15-20(b), all controls and valves for the operation of the system shall be outside the space protected and shall not be located in any space that might be cut off or made inaccessible in the event of fire in any of the spaces protected.

        (b) If the same cylinders are used to protect more than one hazard, a manifold with normally closed stop valves shall be used to direct the carbon dioxide into the proper space. If cylinders are used to protect only one hazard, a normally closed stop valve shall be installed between the cylinders and the hazard except for systems of the type indicated in § 193.15-5(d) which contain not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide.

        (c) One of the stations controlling the system for the main machinery space and the chemical storerooms shall be located as convenient as practicable to one of the main escapes from these spaces. All control stations and the individual valves and controls shall be marked as required by §§ 196.37-10 and 196.37-13 of this subchapter.

        (d) Systems of the type indicated in § 193.15-5(d) shall be actuated by one control operating the valve to the space and a separate control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide. These two controls shall be located in a box or other enclosure clearly identified for the particular space. Those systems installed without a stop valve shall be operated by one control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide.

        (e) Where provisions are made for the simultaneous release of a given amount of carbon dioxide by operation of a remote control, provisions shall also be made for manual control at the cylinders. Where gas pressure from pilot cylinders is used as a means for releasing the remaining cylinders, not less than two pilot cylinders shall be used for systems consisting of more than two cylinders. Each of the pilot cylinders shall be capable of manual control at the cylinder, but the remaining cylinders need not be capable of individual manual control.

        (f) Systems of the type indicated in § 193.15-5(d), other than systems for tanks, which are of more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide, shall be fitted with an approved delayed discharge so arranged that the alarm will be sounded for at least 20 seconds before the carbon dioxide is released into the space. Such systems of not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide shall also have a similar delayed discharge, except for those systems for tanks and for spaces which have a suitable horizontal escape.

        (g) All distribution valves and controls shall be of an approved type. All controls shall be suitably protected.

        (h) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of the systems must be located in a conspicuous place at or near all pull boxes, stop valve controls and in the CO cylinder storage room. On systems in which the CO cylinders are not within the protected space, these instructions must also include a schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of discharging the system should the manual release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to branch lines must be marked to indicate the related space served.

        (i) If the space or enclosure containing the carbon dioxide supply for controls is to be locked, a key to the space or enclosure shall be in a break-glass-type box conspicuously located adjacent to the opening.

#### § § 193.15-15

        (a) The piping, valves, and fittings shall have a bursting pressure of not less than 6,000 pounds per square inch.

        (b) All piping, in nominal sizes not over   inch shall be at least Schedule 40 (standard weight) and in nominal sizes over   inch, shall be at least Schedule 80 (extra heavy).

        (c) All piping valves, and fittings of ferrous materials shall be protected inside and outside against corrosion unless specifically approved otherwise by the Commandant.

        (d) A pressure relief valve or equivalent set to relieve between 2,400 and 2,800 pounds per square inch shall be installed in the distribution manifold or such other location as to protect the piping in the event that all branch line shutoff valves are closed.

        (e) All dead-end lines shall extend at least 2 inches beyond the last orifice and shall be closed with cap or plug.

        (f) All piping, valves, and fittings shall be securely supported, and where necessary, protected against injury.

        (g) Drains and dirt traps shall be fitted where necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt or moisture. Drains and dirt traps shall be located in accessible locations where possible.

        (h) Piping shall be used for no other purpose except that it may be incorporated with the fire-detecting system.

        (i) Piping passing through living quarters shall not be fitted with drains or other openings within such spaces.

        (j) Installation test requirements are:

        (1) Upon completion of the piping installation, and before the cylinders are connected, a pressure test shall be applied as set forth in this paragraph. Only carbon dioxide or other inert gas shall be used for this test.

        (2) The piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold shall be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch. With no additional gas being introduced to the system, it shall be demonstrated that the leakage of the system is such as not to permit a pressure drop of more than 150 pounds per square inch per minute for a 2-minute period.

        (3) The individual branch lines to the various spaces protected shall be subjected to a test similar to that described in the preceding subparagraph with the exception that the pressure used shall be 600 pounds per square inch in lieu of 1,000 pounds per square inch. For the purpose of this test, the distribution piping shall be capped within the space protected at the first joint ahead of the nozzles.

        (4) In lieu of the tests prescribed in the preceding paragraphs in this paragraph, small independent systems protecting spaces such as emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers, chemical storerooms, etc., may be tested by blowing out the piping with air at a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square inch.

        § 193.15-16   Lockout valves.

#### § § 193.15-16

        (a) A lockout valve must be provided on any carbon dioxide extinguishing system protecting a space over 6,000 cubic feet in volume and installed or altered after [July 9, 2013. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.

        (b) The lockout valve must be a manually operated valve located in the discharge manifold prior to the stop valve or selector valves. When in the closed position, the lockout valve must provide complete isolation of the system from the protected space or spaces, making it impossible for carbon dioxide to discharge in the event of equipment failure during maintenance.

        (c) The lockout valve design or locking mechanism must make it obvious whether the valve is open or closed.

        (d) A valve is considered a lockout valve if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which, a lock can be affixed, or it has a locking mechanism built into it.

        (e) The master or person-in-charge must ensure that the valve is locked open at all times, except while maintenance is being performed on the extinguishing system, when the valve must be locked in the closed position.

        (f) Lockout valves added to existing systems must be approved by the Commandant as part of the installed system.

        means a person specifically authorized by the person in charge of the vessel to enter a regulated area.

        means liquefied or gaseous benzene (C H; Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No. 71-43-2) and includes benzene contained in liquid mixtures and the benzene vapors released by these mixtures. The term does not include trace amounts of unreacted benzene contained in solid materials.

        means the area within one foot of a person's mouth and nose.

        means an individual who is on board a vessel by reason of that individual's employment and who is employed directly by the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent of that vessel.

        means the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent of a vessel.

        means an occurrence, such as an equipment failure, a container rupture, or a control equipment failure, which results or may result in an unexpected release of benzene.

        means any operation that could subject a worker to benzene exposures above the PEL, including cargo transfer operations involving connecting or disconnecting liquid or vapor hoses; cargo tank gauging and sampling; and cargo tank gas freeing, venting, and cleaning.

        means the standard in § 197.520.

        means—

        (1) For a self propelled vessel, the master or licensed operator of the vessel; and

        (2) For an unmanned barge,

        (i) The licensed operator of the vessel for barge tows;

        (ii) Where there is no licensed operator, the tankerman who signs the declaration of inspection for a cargo transfer for an operation involving benzene; or

        (iii) Where there is no licensed operator or tankerman, the individual in charge of the vessel when it is moored at a fleet, terminal, or other place.

        or  mean the exposure limits specified in § 197.515.

The person in charge shall not allow any person to enter a regulated area without another individual in the vicinity to perform rescue or call for help. The second individual must maintain communication with the one entering the regulated area or keep that individual in sight. Also, the second individual must be located at the point of access during confined space entry.

        (c) The boundaries of regulated areas must be indicated by barricades, other devices, or by painted areas on the vessel. A sign bearing the following legend in letters at least three inches high (except for the words “DANGER—BENZENE”, which must be printed in letters at least 50 percent larger than the other words) must be posted at each access to the regulated areas:

        § 197.540   Determination of personal exposure.

#### § § 197.540

        (a)  (1) The employer shall ensure that one or more persons in each type of operation conducted on the vessel which involves the handling of or potential exposure to benzene are monitored. The monitoring must be conducted so as to determine the representative personal exposure of all persons engaged in each particular operation involving benzene. Monitoring one vessel of a class is sufficient for all vessels of that class provided the procedures, equipment, work practices, cargo, and control equipment are substantially the same.

        (2) For long duration operations, such as cargo loading or tank entry, the persons monitored must be monitored to determine the representative TWA for all persons engaged in the operation. The monitoring must be based on breathing zone air samples taken for the duration of the operation or for eight hours, whichever is less.

        (3) For short duration operations, such as tank gauging or hose connection and disconnection, the persons monitored must be monitored to determine the representative short term exposure level for all persons engaged in the operation. The monitoring must be based on 15 minute breathing zone air samples. Brief period measuring devices may be used to determine whether monitoring for the short term exposure level is needed.

        (4) If cargoes with different benzene concentrations are being carried on the vessel, an operation involving the lower concentration cargoes need not be monitored if the same type of operation involving the highest concentration cargo is monitored and found to be below the action level.

        (5) Initial monitoring must be conducted during weather conditions typical in the geographic area and during the time of day the operation is normally conducted. If the benzene level is above half the action level for the operation, additional monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.

        (6) The monitoring method used must be accurate to a confidence level of 95 percent to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of benzene equal to or greater than 0.5 ppm.

        (b)  When benzene is first loaded as a cargo on board a vessel, an initial monitoring of each type of operation must be conducted to determine accurately the representative personal exposure of persons involved in the operation.

        (c)  The monitoring must be repeated each July or August if benzene containing cargoes are carried during those months; monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature. If benzene containing cargoes are not carried during those months, monitoring must be conducted at the time of carriage nearest those months; monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.

        (d)  (1) Monitoring in compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be repeated for the operation when there has been a change in the procedure, equipment, or work practices of the operation which may increase personal exposure or whenever the employer or person in charge has any reason to suspect that personal exposure has increased.

        (2) Whenever emergencies occur that may increase personal exposure, operations affected by the emergency must be monitored using area or personal sampling after the spill is cleaned up or the leak, rupture, or other breakdown is repaired to determine when personal exposure has returned to the level that existed before the emergency. There must be monitoring equipment aboard each ship.

        (3) For those cases in which the benzene exposure can vary significantly over the year, the personnel exposure reduction plan can reflect this variation in time if both initial and periodic exposure monitoring are conducted at those times. There must be sufficient monitoring to quantitatively justify differences in the exposure reduction program over the course of the year. The exposure monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.

        (4) The Coast Guard may require additional monitoring upon reasonable belief that the PEL's are being exceeded.

        (e)  (1) Within 60 working days after the receipt of the results of monitoring in compliance with this section, each person involved in the operation monitored must be given written notice of the results, either by separate letter or by notice posted in a location accessible to all persons involved.

        (2) If the results indicate that the PELs were exceeded, the written notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must state, or refer to a document available to the persons involved which states, the corrective action to be taken to reduce the personal exposure to or below the PELs.

        § 197.545   Program to reduce personal exposure.

#### § § 197.545

        (a) When personal exposure for an operation is over the applicable PEL as determined in compliance with § 197.540, the employer shall develop and implement, within 60 working days of the date of that determination, a written program detailing the corrective actions that will be taken to reduce personal exposure to or below the PEL's. The written program must include a timeframe for implementing the corrective actions to be taken.

        (b) Corrective actions in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

        (1) Engineering controls (e.g. vapor control or recovery systems, closed loading systems, or controlled venting systems);

        (2) Revised work practices; or

        (3) Respirators in compliance with § 197.550 and personal protective clothing and equipment in compliance with § 197.555.

        (c) Whenever the exposure monitoring data show a significant increase in personnel exposure, the program must be revised to reflect the new data.

        (d) Each person involved in the operation must be notified that a written program detailing corrective actions is available upon request.

        (e) A copy of the written program must be furnished upon request to the Coast Guard.

        § 197.550   Respiratory protection.

#### § § 197.550

        (a)  When the use of respirators in compliance with this section and the personal protective clothing and equipment in compliance with § 197.555 is chosen as the method or one of the methods in compliance with § 197.545 to be used in meeting the performance standard, the respirators used must be selected and fitted according to this section.

        (b)  (1) The respirator must be approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in compliance with 30 CFR part 11. When filter elements are used, they must include MSHA approval for organic vapors or benzene.

        (2) The employer shall provide affected employees with the appropriate respirators without charge and ensure that the respirators are used properly. Any employee determined by the testing physician as being unable to wear negative pressure respirators, who continues to be subject to exposure over the PEL, must be given the option of wearing a respirator with less breathing resistance, such as a powered air-purifying respirator or a supplied air respirator.

        (3) Electrically powered respiratory protective equipment must meet the electrical engineering requirements in subchapter J of this chapter and the electrical equipment requirements in part 151, table 151.05, and part 153, table 1, of this chapter.

        (4) The type of respirator provided must be a type specified in table 197.550(b) of this section that is appropriate for the exposure.

        (c)  (1) Before the person is permitted to use a respirator selected and fitted in compliance with this section, the person must undergo an Initial Fit Test (IFT) and either a Qualitative Fit Test (QLFT) or a Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT), in compliance with Appendix E of this subpart, using the respirator fitted. If a negative pressure respirator is used, the QLFT or QNFT must be repeated at least once a year thereafter.

        (2) The objective of the tests is to identify for the person a respirator which minimizes the chance of leakage.

        (3) The person conducting the tests required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must understand the purpose of these tests and how to perform them.

        (4) The person conducting the tests required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must certify the results by signing the test report.

        (d)  (1) Employees who are being fitted for respirators must be trained in the methods for properly fitting a respirator and informed of the factors which may affect a proper fit, such as beards, sideburns, dentures, eyeglasses, and goggles, and that an unobstructed sealing surface is critical in fitting a respirator. (See appendix E of this subpart).

        (2) For employees requiring eye glasses, corrective lenses should be fitted to the respirator faceplate. As a temporary measure, glasses with short temple bars may be taped to the wearer's head. Contact lenses other than soft lenses or gas permeable lenses must not be worn with respirators.

        (e)  Persons wearing a respirator in a regulated area must be permitted to leave the regulated area to wash their face and respirator facepiece, as necessary, in order to prevent skin irritation associated with respirator use or, if an air-purifying respirator is used, to change the filter elements whenever the person wearing the respirator detects a change in breathing resistance or a chemical vapor breakthrough.

        (f)  Respirators must be inspected in accordance with ANSI Z88.2—1980, section 8.

        (g)  (1) Respirators must be maintained in accordance with ANSI Z88.2—1980, section 8.

        (2) During respirator cleaning, the rubber or elastomer parts of the respirator must be stretched and manipulated with a massaging action to keep the parts pliable and flexible and to keep the parts from taking a set during storage.

        (3) The air purifying element of air-purifying respirators must be replaced when the employee detects breakthrough or after a period not to exceed eight hours, whichever comes first. The element must also be replaced at the start of each shift. An air purifying element with an end of useful life indicator approved by MSHA or NIOSH for benzene may be used until the indicator indicates end of useful life even if this exceeds eight hours.

        (h)  Respirators must be stored in accordance with ANSI Z88.2—1980, section 8.

        (2) The initial medical examination must be made available to the following employees before they are permitted to enter or continue working in a workplace in which they will be or may be exposed to benzene:

        (i) Employees who were exposed to more than 10 ppm of benzene as an eight-hour TWA on at least 30 calendar days during the year before January 15, 1992 and who were employed by their present employer during each of the 30 days.

        (ii) Employees, other than employees defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, who may reasonably be expected to be exposed to benzene at or above the action level on at least 30 calendar days, or at a level above a PEL on at least 10 calendar days, during the coming year.

        (3) Exposure to benzene, as referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, means any exposure to benzene, whether or not at the time of the exposure, the employee was or will be wearing an appropriate respirator in compliance with § 197.550 and the personal protective clothing and equipment in compliance with § 197.555.

        (4) An initial medical examination is not required if the employer or employee has adequate records showing that the employee has had, within one year, an examination meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (5) The initial medical examination must include at least the following elements:

        (i) A detailed occupational history which includes a history of past work exposure to benzene or any other hematological toxin, a family history of blood dyscrasias including hematological neoplasms, a history of blood dyscrasias including genetic hemoglobin abnormalities, bleeding abnormalities, and abnormal functions of formed blood elements, a history of renal or liver dysfunction, a history of medicinal drugs routinely taken, a history of previous exposure to ionizing radiation, and a history of exposure to marrow toxins outside of the employee's current work situation. The employee must provide to the examining physician as complete an occupational history as possible for the period prior to the current employment.

        (ii) A complete physical examination.

        (iii) A complete blood count, including a leukocyte count, with differential, quantitative thrombocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte count. and erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC). The results of these tests must be reviewed by the examining physician.

        (iv) As determined necessary by the examining physician, additional tests based on alterations to the components of the blood or other signs which may be related to benzene exposure.

        (v) For employees required to wear respirators for at least 30 days a year, a pulmonary function test.

        (c)  (1) The employer shall ensure that no one performs a benzene operation exceeding the level criteria of paragraph (b)(2) of this section without having undergone an initial medical examination and periodic medical examinations yearly thereafter. Also, those who in the previous year have performed benzene operations exceeding the level criteria of paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall undergo a periodic medical examination even if they will not perform benzene operations in the current year. Periodic examinations must include, at least, the following elements:

        (i) A brief history regarding new exposure to potential marrow toxins, changes in medicinal drug use, and the appearance of physical signs relating to blood disorders.

        (ii) A complete blood count, including a leukocyte count with differential, quantitative thrombocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC). The results of these tests must be reviewed by the examining physician.

        (iii) As determined necessary by the examining physician, additional tests based on alterations to the components of the blood or other signs which may be related to benzene exposure.

        (2) If the employee develops signs and symptoms commonly associated with toxic exposure to benzene, the employee must be provided with an additional medical examination which includes those elements considered appropriate by the examining physician.

        (3) For employees required to use respirators for at least 30 days a year, a pulmonary function test must be performed, and specific evaluation of the cardiopulmonary system must be made, at least every three years.

        (d)  (1) If the results of the complete blood count laboratory test required for the initial or periodic medical examination indicate that any of the following abnormal conditions exist, the blood count must be retaken within four weeks:

        (i) The hemoglobin or the hematocrit falls below the normal limit (outside the 95% confidence interval (C.I.)), as determined by the laboratory, or the hemoglobin or hematocrit shows a persistent downward trend from the employee's pre-exposure norms, if these findings cannot be explained by other medical reasons.

        (ii) The thrombocyte count varies more than 20 percent below the employee's most recent values or falls outside the normal limit (95% C.I.), as determined by the laboratory.

        (iii) The leukocyte count is below 4,000 per cubic millimeter or there is an abnormal differential count.

        (2) If the abnormal conditions persist, the employee must be referred by the examining physician to a hematologist or an internist for further evaluation, unless the physician has good reason to believe that the referral is unnecessary. (See appendix C of this subpart for examples of conditions in which referrals may be unnecessary.)

        (3) The hematologist or internist must be provided with the information provided to the physician in compliance with paragraph (f) of this section and with the medical record in compliance with § 197.570(b).

        (4) If the hematologist or internist determines that additional tests are needed, the employer shall ensure that these additional tests are provided. These test must be completed in thirty days, whether or not the employee continues to perform benzene operations.

        (e)  (1) Whenever an employee is exposed to benzene resulting from an emergency, a sample of that employee's urine must be taken at the end of the employee's shift and a urinary phenol test must be performed on the sample within 72 hours. Where due to unavoidable circumstances the sample cannot be tested by a laboratory within 72 hours of exposure, the sample shall be frozen until it can be delivered to the laboratory. The specific gravity of the urine must be corrected to 1.024. Since certain foods and medications can result in elevated phenol levels, the employee must provide the physician with a dietary and medication history.

        (2) If the result of the urinary phenol test is below 75 mg phenol/l of urine, no further testing is required.

        (3) If the result of the urinary phenol test is equal to or greater than 75 mg phenol/l of urine, the employee's complete blood count including an erythrocyte count, a leukocyte count with differential, and a thrombocyte count must be taken at monthly intervals for a duration of three months following the emergency.

        (4) If any of the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section exists, the additional examinations and referrals specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be performed and the employee must be provided with periodic medical examinations, if any are recommended by the examining physician.

        (f)  The following information must be provided to the examining physician:

        (1) A copy of this subpart and its appendices.

        (2) A description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee's exposure.

        (3) The employee's actual or representative exposure level.

        (4) A description of the respirator and personal protective clothing and equipment used or to be used, if any.

        (2) The written opinion must contain at least the following information:

        (i) The occupationally pertinent results of the medical examination and tests.

        (ii) All medical conditions, if any, of the employee which the examining physician believes would subject the employee to a greater than normal risk of material impairment of health if the employee is exposed again to benzene.

        (iii) The examining physician's recommended limitations, if any, upon the employee's future exposure to benzene or use of respirators or other personal protective clothing or equipment.

        (iv) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the medical examination and of all medical conditions of the employee resulting from benzene exposure which require further explanation or treatment.

        (3) The physician's written opinion must not reveal specific records, findings, or diagnoses that have no bearing on the employee's ability to work in a benzene-exposed workplace, ability to use a respirator, or ability to use personal protective clothing or equipment.

        (h)  (1) From the time an employee is referred to a hematologist or internist in compliance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the employee must not be permitted to enter areas where personal exposure may exceed the action level until the physician determines in compliance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section that the employee again may enter those areas.

        (2) After examination by and consultation with the hematologist or internist, the examining physician decides whether or not to permit the employee to enter areas where personal exposure may exceed the action level. The employee must provide the employer with a written copy of the physician's decision signed by the physician. If the decision recommends that the employee not be permitted to enter those areas, the decision must include the examining physician's opinion as to when the employee may be permitted to reenter those areas and the requirements for future medical examinations to review the decision.

        (3) Within six months of the date a decision in compliance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section not to permit reentry is made, the employee must be provided with a follow-up examination and a decision of the examining physician (based on the follow-up examination and consultation with a hematologist or internist) as to whether reentry should be permitted and, if so, when, or whether it should be permanently prohibited.

        (2) On a vessel engaged on voyage when the passengers or special personnel are scheduled to be on board for more than 24 hours, musters of the passengers and special personnel must take place within 24 hours after their embarkation. Passengers and special personnel must be instructed in the use of the lifejackets and the action to take in an emergency.

        (3) Whenever new passengers or special personnel embark, a safety briefing must be given immediately before sailing or immediately after sailing. The briefing must include the instructions required by § 199.80 and must be made by means of an announcement in one or more languages likely to be understood by the passengers and special personnel. The announcement must be made on the vessel's public address system or by other equivalent means likely to be heard by the passengers and special personnel who have not yet heard it during the voyage. The briefing may be included in the muster required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the muster is held immediately upon departure. Information cards or posters, or video programs displayed on the vessel video displays, may be used to supplement the briefing, but may not be used to replace the announcement.

        (c)  (1) Drills must, as far as practicable, be conducted as if there were an actual emergency.

        (2) Every crewmember must participate in at least one abandon-ship drill and one fire drill every month. The drills of the crew must take place within 24 hours of the vessel leaving a port if more than 25 percent of the crew have not participated in abandon-ship and fire drills on board that particular vessel in the previous month.

        (3) Drills must be held before sailing when a vessel enters service for the first time, after modification of a major character, or when a new crew is engaged.

        (4) The OCMI may accept other equivalent drill arrangements for those classes of vessels for which compliance with this paragraph is impracticable.

        (d)  (1) Abandon-ship drills must include—

        (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, each lifeboat must be launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and maneuvered in the water at least once every 3 months during an abandon-ship drill.

        (5) Lowering into the water, rather than launching of a lifeboat arranged for free-fall launching, is acceptable when free-fall launching is impracticable, provided that the lifeboat is free-fall launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and is maneuvered in the water at least once every 6 months. However, when compliance with the 6-month requirement is impracticable, the OCMI may extend this period to 12 months, provided that arrangements are made for simulated launching at intervals of not more than 6 months.

        (6) The OCMI may exempt a vessel operating on short international voyages from the requirement to launch the lifeboats on both sides of the vessel if berthing arrangements in port and operations do not permit launching of lifeboats on one side. However, all lifeboats on the vessel must be lowered at least once every 3 months and launched at least annually.

        (7) As far as is reasonable and practicable, rescue boats, other than lifeboats which are also rescue boats, must be launched with their assigned crew aboard and maneuvered in the water each month. Such launching and maneuvering must occur at least once every 3 months.

        (8) If lifeboat and rescue boat launching drills are carried out with the vessel making headway, such drills must, because of the dangers involved, be practiced in sheltered waters only and be under the supervision of an officer experienced in such drills.

        (9) If a vessel is fitted with marine evacuation systems, drills must include an exercising of the procedures required for the deployment of such a system up to the point immediately preceding actual deployment of the system. This aspect of drills should be augmented by regular instruction using the on board training aids. Additionally, every crewmember assigned to duties involving the marine evacuation system must, as far as practicable, participate in a full deployment of a similar system into water, either on board a vessel or ashore, every 2 years but not longer than every 3 years. This training may be associated with the deployments required by § 199.190(k).

        (10) Emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment must be tested at each abandon-ship drill.

        (11) If a vessel carries immersion suits or anti-exposure suits, the suits must be worn by crewmembers in at least one abandon ship drill in any three-month period. If wearing the suits is impracticable due to warm weather, the crewmembers must be instructed on their donning and use.

        (12) If a vessel carries immersion suits for persons other than the crew, the abandon-ship drill must include instruction to these persons on the stowage, donning, and use of the suits.

        (e)  A drill must be conducted on the use of the line-throwing appliance at least once every 3 months. The actual firing of the appliance is at the discretion of the master.

        (vi) Checking the necessary arrangements for subsequent abandonment of the vessel.

        (3) The equipment used during drills must immediately be brought back to its fully operational condition. Any faults and defects discovered during the drills must be remedied as soon as possible.

        (g)  (1) Onboard training in the use of the vessel's lifesaving appliances, including survival craft equipment, and in the use of the vessel's fire-extinguishing appliances must be given as soon as possible but not later than 2 weeks after a crewmember joins the vessel.

        (2) If the crewmember is on a regularly scheduled rotating assignment to the vessel, the training required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section need be given only within 2 weeks of the time the crewmember first joins the vessel.

        (3) The crew must be instructed in the use of the vessel's fire-extinguishing and lifesaving appliances and in survival at sea at the same interval as the drills. Individual units of instruction may cover different parts of the vessel's lifesaving and fire-extinguishing appliances, but all the vessel's lifesaving and fire-extinguishing appliances must be covered within any period of 2 months.

        (4) Every crewmember must be given instructions that include, but are not limited to—

        (i) The operation and use of the vessel's inflatable liferafts;

        (ii) The problems of hypothermia, first aid treatment for hypothermia, and other appropriate first aid procedures;

        (a)  Vessels operating in oceans; coastwise; Great Lakes; lakes, bays, and sounds; and rivers service may comply with alternative requirements to subparts A through E of this part as described in this section for the services specified in table 199.620(a) of this section.

        (b)  As an alternative to a lifebuoy approved under approval series 160.150, vessels may carry a lifebuoy approved under approval series 160.050.

        (c)  As an alternative to a lifejacket meeting the approval requirements in § 199.70, vessels may carry a lifejacket approved under approval series in subparts 160.002, 160.005, 160.055, 160.077, or 160.255 of part 160 of this chapter. An inflatable lifejacket approved under approval series in subpart 160.255 of part 160 of this chapter must include a full back-up inflation chamber.

        (d)  Vessels may carry lifejackets as follows:

        (1) If lifejackets are stowed in cabins, staterooms, or berthing areas that are readily accessible to each watch or work station, the requirement in § 199.70(b)(2)(iv) to have lifejackets at each watch or work station need not be met.

        (2) If the vessel carries lifejackets that are designated extended-size, then the number of child-size lifejackets carried to meet § 199.70(b)(1)(i) may be reduced. To take the reduction in child-size lifejackets, extended-size lifejackets having the same lower size limit must be substituted for all of the required adult lifejackets. The number of child-size lifejackets required depends on the lower size limit of the extended-size lifejackets and is calculated by any one of the following formulas where PC is the number of child-size lifejackets expressed as a percentage of the number of lifejackets required under § 199.70(b)(1):

        (i) PC = LS ÷ 4.1, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in kilograms.

        (ii) PC = LS ÷ 9, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in pounds.

        (iii) PC = (LS−81) ÷ 7.6, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in centimeters.

        (iv) PC = (LS−32) ÷ 3, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in inches.

        (e)  As an alternative to lights approved under approval series 161.112, vessels may use lights for lifejackets and immersions suits approved under series 161.012. However, lifejacket lights bearing Coast Guard approval number 161.012/2/1 are not permitted on vessels certificated to operate on waters where water temperature may drop below 10 °C (50 °F).

        § 199.630   Alternatives for passenger vessels in a specified service.

#### § § 199.630

        (a) In addition to the alternatives for certain requirements in § 199.620, passenger vessels operating in oceans; coastwise; Great Lakes; lakes, bays, and sounds; and rivers service may comply with alternative requirements to subparts A through C of this part as described in this section for the services specified in table 199.630(a) of this section.

        (b) As an alternative to distress signals that meet the requirements of § 199.60, vessels may carry at least 12 hand red flare distress signals approved under approval series 160.021 or 160.121.

        (c) As an alternative to the lifeboat capacity requirements of § 199.201(b)(1)(i), vessels may carry lifeboats with an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate not less than 30 percent of the total number of persons on board. These lifeboats must be equally distributed, as far as practicable, on each side of the vessel. Liferafts on these vessels may be either SOLAS A or SOLAS B liferafts.

        (d) As an alternative to the survival craft requirements of § 199.201(b), vessels may carry inflatable buoyant apparatus having an aggregate capacity, together with the capacities of any lifeboats, rescue boats, and liferafts carried on board sufficient to, accommodate the total number of persons on board. These inflatable buoyant apparatus must—

        (1) Be served by launching appliances or marine evacuation systems evenly distributed on each side of the vessel if the embarkation deck is more than 3 meters (10 feet) above—

        (i) The waterline under normal operating conditions; or

        (ii) The equilibrium waterline after the vessel is subjected to the assumed damage and subdivision requirements in part 171 of this chapter;

        (2) Be stowed in accordance with the requirements of §§ 199.130(a), 199.130(c), and 199.178; and

        (3) Be equipped in accordance with the requirements in table 199.640(j) of this part.

        (e) As an alternative to the survival craft requirements of § 199.201(b), vessels may carry—

        (1) Liferafts having an aggregate capacity, together with the capacities of any lifeboats carried on board, sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board that are served by launching appliances or marine evacuation systems evenly distributed on each side of the vessel; and

        (2) In addition to the liferafts required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, additional liferafts that have an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate at least 10 percent of the total number of persons, or equal to the capacity of the largest single survival craft on the vessel, whichever is the greater. The additional liferafts are not required to be stowed in accordance with § 199.130(c), but they must be served by at least one launching appliance or marine evacuation system on each side of the vessel.

        (f) As an alternative to the survival craft requirements of § 199.201(b), vessels may have a safety assessment approved by the local OCMI that addresses the following:

        (1) The navigation and vessel safety conditions within the vessel's planned operating area including—

        (i) The scope and degree of the risks or hazards to which the vessel will be subject during normal operations;

        (ii) The existing vessel traffic characteristics and trends, including traffic volume; the sizes and types of vessels involved; potential interference with the flow of commercial traffic; the presence of any unusual cargoes; and other similar factors;

        (iii) The port and waterway configuration and variations in local conditions of geography, climate, and other similar factors; and

        (iv) Environmental factors.

        (2) A comprehensive shipboard safety management and contingency plan that is tailored to the particular vessel, is easy to use, is understood by vessel management personnel both on board and ashore, is updated regularly, and includes—

        (ii) Procedures to mobilize emergency response teams;

        (iii) Procedures for moving passengers from the vessel's spaces to areas protected from fire and smoke, to embarkation areas, and off the vessel. The procedures must address provisions for passengers with physical or mental impairments;

        (iv) Lists of external organizations that the vessel's operator would call for assistance in the event of an incident;

        (v) Procedures for establishing and maintaining communications on board the vessel and with shoreside contacts; and

        (vi) Guidance on theoretical, practical, and actual simulation training that includes the personnel or organizations identified in the plan so they can practice their roles in the event of an incident.

        (g) As an alternative to the survival craft requirements of § 199.201(b), vessels may carry inflatable buoyant apparatus having an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate 67 percent of the total number of persons on board, minus the capacities of any lifeboats, rescue boats and liferafts carried on board. These inflatable buoyant apparatus must meet the arrangement requirements of § 199.630 (d)(1) through (d)(3). The number of persons accommodated in an inflatable buoyant apparatus may not exceed 150% of its rated capacity.

        (h) A vessel need not comply with the requirements for survival craft in § 199.201(b) if the vessel operates—

        (1) On a route that is in shallow water not more than 3 miles from shore and the vessel cannot sink deep enough to submerge the topmost deck; or

        (2) Where the cognizant OCMI determines that survivors can wade ashore.

        (i) As an alternative to the rescue boat required in § 199.202, vessels may carry a rescue boat meeting the requirements of part 160, subpart 160.056 of this chapter if it is equipped with a motor and meets the following:

        (1) The towline for the rescue boat must be at least the same size and length as the rescue boat painter.

        (2) The rescue boat must meet the embarkation, launching, and recovery arrangement requirements in § 199.160 (b) through (f). The OCMI may allow deviations from the rescue boat launching requirements based on the characteristics of the boat and the conditions of the vessel's route.

        (j) As an alternative to the requirements of § 199.203(a), a vessel that meets the subdivision requirements in § 171.068 of this chapter may meet the requirements of § 199.203(b).

        (k) Vessels carrying lifebuoys may carry—

        (1) The number of lifebuoys specified in table 199.630(k) of this section instead of the number required in § 199.211; and

        (2) If the vessel carries less than four lifebuoys, at least two with a self-igniting light attached to the lifebuoy. A buoyant lifeline may be fitted to one of the lifebuoys with a self-igniting light.

        (l) A deck officer, able seaman, certificated person, or person practiced in the handling of liferafts or inflatable buoyant apparatus is not required to be placed in charge of each inflatable buoyant apparatus, provided that there are a sufficient number of such persons on board to launch the inflatable buoyant apparatus and supervise the embarkation of the passengers. The number of persons on board for the purpose of launching and operating inflatable buoyant apparatus may be reduced during any voyage where the vessel is carrying less than the number of passengers permitted on board, and the number of such persons is sufficient to launch and operate the number of survival craft required to accommodate everyone on board.

        (m) The person designated second-in-command of survival craft is not required to be a certificated person if the person is practiced in the handling and operation of survival craft.
