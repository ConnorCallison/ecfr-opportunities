      means an award of financial assistance that, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6304, is used to enter into a relationship whereby—

      (a) The principal purpose of which is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States, rather than to acquire property or services for the Federal Government's direct benefit or use; and

      (b) In which substantial involvement is not expected between the Federal agency and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the award.

      § 1401.255   Individual.

#### § § 1401.255

      means a natural person.

      § 1401.260   Recipient.

#### § § 1401.260

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees; and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace.

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards.

#### § § 1401.325

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1401.305(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

#### § § 1401.330

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each DOI award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

      (1) To the DOI official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by DOI officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used ( all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the DOI awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the DOI awarding official.

      § 1401.335   Whom in the DOI does a recipient other than an individual notify about a criminal drug conviction?

#### § § 1401.335

      The DOI is not designating a central location for the receipt of these reports. Therefore you shall provide this report to every grant officer, or other designee within a bureau or office of the Department on whose grant activity the convicted employee was working.

      (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the Department of the Interior awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 1401.401 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

      § 1401.401   Whom in the DOI does a recipient who is an individual notify about a criminal drug conviction?

#### § § 1401.401

      The DOI is not designating a central location for the receipt of these reports. Therefore you shall provide this report to every grant officer, or other designee within a bureau or office of the Department on whose grant activity the convicted employee was working.

    Subpart E—Responsibilities of Department of Interior Awarding Officials

      § 1401.500   What are my responsibilities as a DOI awarding official?

    Subpart F—Violations of this Part and Consequences

      § 1401.600   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 1401.600

      A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Director, PAM determines, in writing, that—

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

      § 1401.605   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 1401.605

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart C of this part; or

      (b) The recipient is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity.

      § 1401.610   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 1401.610

      If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 1401.600 or § 1401.605, DOI may take one or more of the following actions—

      (a) Suspension of payments under the award;

      (b) Suspension or termination of the award; and

      (c) Suspension or debarment of the recipient under 2 CFR part 180, for a period not to exceed five years.

      § 1401.615   Are there any exceptions to those actions?

#### § § 1401.615

      The Secretary of the Interior may waive with respect to a particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the Secretary of the Interior determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.

      §§ 1402.104-1402.111   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 1402.104-1402.111

      § 1402.112   What are the conflict of interest policies?

#### § § 1402.112

      This section shall apply to all non-Federal entities. NOFOs and financial assistance awards must include the full text of the conflict of interest provisions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.

      (a)  (1) This section intends to ensure that non-Federal entities and their employees take appropriate steps to avoid conflicts of interest in their responsibilities under or with respect to Federal financial assistance agreements.

      § 1402.113   What are the mandatory disclosure requirements?

#### § § 1402.113

      In addition to the disclosures required under 2 CFR 200.112 and 200.113, non-Federal entities, including applicants for all Federal awards, must disclose in writing any potential or actual conflict of interest to the DOI awarding agency or pass-through entity. Non-Federal entities and applicants must also disclose any outstanding unresolved matters with the Government Accountability Office or an Office of Inspector General when submitting a proposal and through the life of the award as needed.

      §§ 1402.114-1402.203   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 1402.114-1402.203

    Subpart C—Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards

      § 1402.204   What are the merit review requirements for competitive awards?

#### § § 1402.204

      The requirements in this section apply to competitive grants and cooperative agreements unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute. Merit review procedures must be described or incorporated by reference in NOFOs (see 2 CFR part 200, appendix I, and 2 CFR 200.203). Pre-award considerations for both discretionary competitive and noncompetitive awards shall take into account the alignment of the award's purpose, goals, and measurement with the current DOI Government Performance and Results Act Strategic Plan including, the mission statement, vision, values, goals, objectives, strategies, and performance metrics therein, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

      (a)  Competition is expected in awarding discretionary funds, unless otherwise directed by Congress. When grants and cooperative agreements are awarded competitively, DOI requires that the competitive process be fair and impartial, that all applicants be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the announcement, and that no applicant receive an unfair competitive advantage. All competitive funding announcements, and all modifications/amendments to those announcements, must be posted on  ().

      (b)  Bureaus and offices must conduct reviews of applications submitted in response to the announcement and for selecting applicants for award following established merit review procedures. Bureaus and offices must conduct comprehensive, impartial, and objective review of applications based on the criteria contained in the announcement by individuals who have no conflicts of interest with respect to the competing proposal/applications or applicants. Bureaus and offices must ensure reviewers are qualified, applications are scored on the basis of announced criteria, consideration is given to the level of applicant risk and past performance, applications are ranked, and funding determinations are made.

      (c)  Bureaus and offices must develop an Evaluation and Selection Plan in concert with the notice of funding opportunity to ensure consistency, and to outline and document the selection process. The Evaluation and Selection Plan should be finalized prior to the release of the notice of funding opportunity. An Evaluation and Selection Plan is comprised of five basic elements:

      (1) Merit review factors and sub-factors;

      (2) A rating system ( adjectival, color coding, numerical, or ordinal);

      (3) Evaluation standards or descriptions that explain the basis for assignment of the various rating system grades/scores;

      (4) Program policy factors; and

      (5) The basis for selection.

      (d)  Bureaus and offices must initially screen applications/proposals to ensure that they meet the standards in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section before they are subjected to a detailed evaluation utilizing a merit review process specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The review system should include three phases: Initial Screening, Threshold Screening, and a Merit Review Evaluation Screening. Bureaus and offices may remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass the basic eligibility screening per paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.

      (e)  Bureaus and offices may return applications/proposals that are incomplete or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the  announcement to the applicant to be corrected, modified, or supplemented, or may reject the application/proposal outright. Until the application/proposal meets the substantive requirements of the announcement and this part, it shall not be given detailed evaluation. Bureaus and offices may use discretion to determine the length of time for applicants to resolve application deficiencies.

      (f)  Bureaus and offices must consider the timeliness of the application submission. Applications that are submitted beyond the announced deadline date must be removed from the review process.

      (g)  Bureaus and offices are responsible for screening applications and proposals for the adequacy of the budget and compliance with statutory and other requirements. The SF-424 and budget information (SF-424A, SF-424C, or OMB-approved alternate budget data collection) must be reviewed according to Department of the Interior policy.

      (h)  This is the final review stage where the technical merit of the application/proposal is reviewed. In the absence of a program rule or statutory requirement, program officials shall develop criteria that include all aspects of technical merit. Bureaus and offices shall develop criteria that are conceptually independent of each other, but all-encompassing when taken together. While criteria will vary, the basic criteria shall focus reviewers' attention on the project's underlying merit ( significance, approach, and feasibility). The criteria shall focus not only on the technical details of the proposed project but also on the broader importance or potential impact of the project. The criteria shall be easily understood.

      (i)  Bureaus and offices must also consider risk thresholds during application/proposal review process. Elements to be considered may include organization; single audit submissions, past performance; availability of necessary resources, equipment, or facilities; financial strength and management capabilities; and procurement procedures; or procedures for selecting and monitoring subrecipients or sub-vendors, if applicable. For all non-Federal entities that receive an award, the Financial Assistance Officer must document the risk analysis.

      (j)  Upon receipt of a Memorandum of Appointment, each proposal evaluator and advisor must sign and return a Conflict of Interest Certificate to the Financial Assistance Officer. If an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the appointee may not evaluate or provide advice on a potential applicant's proposal until the conflict has been resolved or mitigated. Further, each proposal evaluator or advisor must agree to comply with any notice or limitation placed on the application. Upon completion of the review, the proposal evaluator or advisor shall return or destroy all copies of the application and accompanying proposals (or abstracts) to DOI; and unless authorized by the Financial Assistance Officer or agency designee, the reviewer shall not contact the non-Federal entity concerning any aspect of the application.

#### § § 1402.205

      § 1402.206   What are the FAIR requirements for domestic for-profit entities?

#### § § 1402.206

      (a)  (1) Section 1402.207(a) contains standard award terms and conditions that always apply to for-profit entities and § 1402.207(b) contains terms that apply to sub-awards or contracts with for-profit entities over the simplified acquisition threshold. Bureaus and offices must incorporate into awards to domestic for-profit organizations the award terms and conditions that always apply, either directly or by reference.

      (2) Bureaus and offices may apply the administrative guidelines in subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200, the cost principles at 48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and the procedures for negotiating indirect costs (detailed in § 1402.414) to domestic for-profit entities.

      (3) Depending on the nature of a particular program, offices and bureaus may additionally develop program-specific administrative guidelines for domestic for-profits based on the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subparts A through D, but may not apply more restrictive requirements than the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subparts A through D, unless approved by OMB through a request to the Director, Office of Grants Management.

#### § §§ 1402.316-1402.328

      § 1402.329   What are the requirements for land acquired under an award?

#### § § 1402.329

      (a)  Bureaus and offices must ensure compliance with the prior written approval requirements for land acquisition in 2 CFR 200.439. Whenever a recipient is seeking DOI's approval to use award funds to purchase an interest in real property, the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, SF-429-B, Request to Acquire, Improve, or Furnish, or approved alternate standardized data collection, must be submitted to the bureau or office. The Financial Assistance Officer is responsible for ensuring that this requirement is met. All aspects of the purchase must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to purchases of land or interests in land.

      (b)  (1) Unless a waiver valuation applies in accordance with 49 CFR 24.102(c), land or interests in land that will be acquired under the award must be appraised in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, (UASFLA or the “Yellow Book”), developed and promulgated by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, 1155 15th Street NW, Suite 1111, Washington, DC 20005, by a real property appraiser licensed or certified by the State or States in which the property is located. The appraisal report shall be reviewed by a qualified review appraiser that meets qualifications established by the DOI Appraisal and Valuation Services Office (AVSO), which is responsible for appraisal and valuation services and policy across the Department. Bureaus and offices shall ensure that funds are not disbursed for purchases of land or interests in land without an appraisal accompanied by a written appraisal review report that complies with standards approved by AVSO. Where appraisals are required to support federally assisted land acquisitions, AVSO has oversight responsibilities for these appraisals, including those purchased through financial assistance actions in the various grant programs within the Department. AVSO will coordinate with grant programs to conduct periodic internal control review of appraisal and appraisal review reports prepared in conjunction with grant applications for land acquisition.

      (2) The Director of the Federal Register approves the material referenced in this section for incorporation by reference into this section in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (c)  Land to be acquired under an award that is located outside the United States must be appraised by an independent real property appraiser licensed or certified in the country in which the property is located in accordance with any in-country appraisal standards, if they exist, or with International Valuation Standards, when such appraisals are available and financially feasible. Otherwise, the non-Federal entity must use the most widely accepted business practice for property valuation in the country where the property is located and provide to the awarding DOI bureau or office a detailed explanation of the methodology used to determine value.

      (d)  (1) For all financial assistance actions where real property is acquired under the Federal award, the recipient must submit reports on the status of the real property. Bureaus and offices must ensure recipients receive written notification of those reporting requirements, including reporting frequency/schedule, report content requirements, and submission instructions, at the time of award.

      (2) If the interest in the land will be held for less than 15 years, reports must be submitted annually. If the interest in the land will be held for 15 years or more, then the recipient must submit the first report within one year of the period of performance end date of the award and then, at a minimum, every five years thereafter.

      (3) The reports must be submitted to the Financial Assistance Officer within the period of performance of the award. After the end of the period of performance, reports must be submitted to a designated individual. Each bureau must have a process in place to designate specific individuals to receive, and review and accept the report.

      (4) Recipients must use the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, the Real Property Status Report Standard Form (SF) 429-A, General Reporting, to report status of land or interests in land under Federal financial assistance awards. Bureaus or offices may request to use an equivalent reporting format. The Director, Office of Grants Management must approve alternate equivalent formats.

      (5) Reports must include, at a minimum, sufficient information to demonstrate that all conditions imposed on the land use are being met, and a signed certification to that fact by the recipient of the financial assistance award.

      (6) The Financial Assistance Officer must indicate the reporting schedule, including due dates, in the award document. The schedule must conform with the frequency required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For awards issued prior to October 29, 2019, the recipient must contact the program to establish due dates for reports going forward. If there is already a reporting schedule in place, then the recipient and the program shall ensure that the schedule is updated to conform with this part prior to the due date of the next scheduled report.

      §§ 1402.330-1402.413   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 1402.330-1402.413

      § 1402.414   What are the negotiated indirect cost rate deviation policies?

#### § § 1402.414

      (a) This section establishes DOI policies, procedures, and decision making criteria for using an indirect cost rate that differs from the non-Federal entity's negotiated rate or approved rate for DOI awards. These are established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(3) or (f).

      (b) DOI accepts indirect cost rates that have been reduced or removed voluntarily by the proposed recipient of the award, on an award-specific basis.

      (c) For all deviations to the Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, including statutory, regulatory, programmatic, and voluntary, the basis of direct costs against which the indirect cost rate is applied must be:

      (1) The same base identified in the recipient's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, if the recipient has a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement; or

      (2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).

      (d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.

      (1)  In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.

      (2)  Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.

      (3)  Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:

      (i)  Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.

      (ii)  Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.

      (iii)  Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.

      (4)  On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.

      (5)  In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.
