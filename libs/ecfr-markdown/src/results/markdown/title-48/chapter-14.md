        (c)  (1) For debarment actions based upon a conviction, civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(d)(1), the Debarring Official shall make a decision on the basis of the information in the administrative record, including any contractor submissions. Where the proceeding includes an oral presentation of matters in opposition (PMIO) to the Debarring Official, the PMIO will be conducted in an informal business meeting format and tape recorded for the administrative record.

        (2) For actions listed under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), upon concluding from a contractor's information in response to the action notice that facts material to the existence of cause for debarment are genuinely in dispute, the Debarring Official may refer the disputed material facts to another official for fact-finding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Debarment Program fact-finding procedures.

        (i) The fact-finding proceeding will be transcribed. The fact-finding official will file the original copy of the transcript with the case record. The reporter's fees and other direct costs associated with the hearing shall be borne by the bureau or office initiating the debarment action, except in the case of actions initiated by the OIG. For actions initiated by the OIG, the costs will be borne by the bureau(s) and/or office(s) out of which the matter arose. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor as provided under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).

        (ii) Subject to the provisions of 43 CFR part 1, the contractor, and any specifically named affiliate, may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor under the condition in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).

        (iii) The fact-finding official will prepare findings of fact, certify the entire hearing record and provide said findings and record to the Debarring Official. The fact-finding official shall not make any recommendations unless the Debarring Official has expressly requested such recommendations in writing. Following receipt of the findings of fact, the Debarring Official shall complete debarment proceedings and issue a written debarment decision.

        (d)  Matters may be resolved through administrative agreement at any stage of proceedings of a debarment action where a contractor agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding eligibility for DOI contracting will vary with the terms of the agreements. In general, such agreements resolve debarment concerns and thereby terminate any imposed or pending award ineligibility. In the event of an agreement, PAM will notify COs of the agreement and its terms.

        (e)  Administrative review of the Debarring Official's decision under FAR 9.406-3(e) may be sought as follows:

        (1) The contractor may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision, request the Debarring Official to reconsider the decision for clear material errors of fact or law which would change the outcome of the matter.

        (2) The Debarring Official may exercise his/her discretion and stay the debarment pending reconsideration review. The Debarring Official will notify the contractor in writing of the decision on reconsideration.

        (3) A review request under this section must be in writing, clearly state the specific findings believed to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for the position.

        1409.407   Suspension.

#### § 1409.407

        1409.407-1   General.

#### § 1409.407-1

        The Director, PAM, is authorized to make the determination in FAR 9.407-1(d).

        1409.407-3   Procedures.

#### § 1409.407-3

        (a)  Whenever a cause for suspension, as listed in FAR 9.407-2, becomes known to a DOI employee, the matter shall be referred by the case representative to the Suspending Official, in consultation, as appropriate, with the HCA involved, the SOL, and the OIG. The case representative will review the matter and, if warranted, prepare and submit to the Debarring Official for consideration an Action Referral Memorandum (ARM) with supporting documentation.

        (b)  After review of the ARM, if appropriate, the Debarring Official shall initiate a suspension by taking the actions listed in FAR 9.407-3(c), and advising the contractor of the Department's process for contesting the action.

        (c)  (1) For suspension actions based upon an indictment or equivalent charging document, or where there is no genuine dispute over material facts, consistent with FAR 9.407-3(d), or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of DOJ advice, the Suspending Official shall make a decision on the basis of the information in the administrative record, including any submission by the contractor. Where the proceeding includes an oral PMIO to the Suspending Official, the PMIO will be conducted in an informal business meeting format and tape recorded for the administrative record.

        (2) For actions listed under FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), when the Debarring Official concludes from information in a contractor's response to the proposed action notice that facts material to the existence of a cause for debarment are genuinely in dispute, the Suspending Official may refer the disputed material facts to another official for hearing and findings of fact.

        (i) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Suspension Program fact-finding procedures.

        (ii) The fact-finding proceeding will be transcribed. The reporter's fees and other direct costs associated with the hearing shall be borne by the bureau or office initiating the suspension referral, except in the case of actions initiated by the OIG. For actions initiated by the OIG, costs will be borne by Bureaus and/or offices out of which the matter arose. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor under the condition in FAR 9.407-3(b)(2)(ii).

        (iii) Subject to the provisions of 43 CFR part 1, the contractor, and any specifically named affiliates, may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the suspension.

        (iv) The fact-finding official will prepare findings of fact, certify the entire hearing record and provide said findings and record to the Suspending Official. The fact-finding official shall not make any recommendations unless the Suspending Official has expressly requested such recommendations in writing. Following receipt of the findings of fact, the Suspending Official shall complete suspension proceedings and issue a written decision. Matters may be resolved through an administrative agreement at any stage of the proceedings.

        (d)  Matters may be resolved through an administrative agreement at any stage of proceedings in resolution of a suspension action where a contractor agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding eligibility for DOI contracting will vary with the terms of the agreements. In general, such agreements resolve suspension concerns and thereby terminate award ineligibility. An administrative agreement resolving a suspension action may by its terms be an interim agreement. In the event of an agreement, PAM will notify COs of the agreement and its terms.

        (e)  Administrative review of the Suspending Official's decision under FAR 9.407-3(d) may be sought as follows:

        (1) The contractor may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision, ask the Suspending Official to reconsider the decision for clear material errors of fact or law which would change the outcome of the matter.

        (2) The Suspending Official may in the exercise of discretion stay the debarment pending reconsideration review. The Suspending Official will notify the contractor in writing of the decision on reconsideration.

        (3) A review request under this section must be submitted in writing; clearly state the specific findings believed to be in error, and include the reasons or legal bases for the position.

        (b) Request for waivers shall be made by the HCA, through the appropriate SOL, to the Director, PAM. Each request shall include:

        (1) An analysis of the facts involving the potential or actual conflict, including benefits and detriments to the Government and prospective contractor(s);

        (2) A discussion of the factors which preclude avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating the conflict; and

        1409.506   Procedures.

#### § 1409.506

        If the CO determines that contractor performance of the contemplated work is likely to create an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer shall refer the documentation of the potential conflict and proposed resolution prepared in accordance with 7.105(b)(18) to the HCA for approval. Referrals to the HCA shall be initiated by the CO and reviewed by the SOL.

#### § 1415.201

        (a) Use of a presolicitation conference shall be approved at one level above the CO.

        (b) A CO may issue a solicitation for information or planning purposes without a written justification and without obtaining a higher level of approval.

        1415.207   Handling proposals and information.

#### § 1415.207

        1415.207-70   Department of the Interior proposal and information handling procedures.

#### § 1415.207-70

        (a)  This section establishes procedures that must be used in addition to those prescribed in FAR 15.207, for the use and disclosure of trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information contained in solicited proposals.

        (b)  A solicited proposal may contain trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information which the offeror, or its subcontractors, prefers not to be disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal. To notify the Government of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information contained in a proposal, offerors must mark the cover page of the proposal and each affected page of the proposal with the legends specified in the solicitation provision at 1452.215-71, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior. COs and other government personnel evaluating a proposal shall not refuse to consider the proposal because it contains information identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information.

        (c)  The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with 1452.215-71. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with 1452.215-71, the offeror concerned shall be notified promptly of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.

        (d)  The provision at 1452.215-71, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior, shall be inserted in all requests for proposals and requests for quotations.

        1415.207-71   Confidentiality of proposal evaluation.

#### § 1415.207-71

        (a) The safeguarding of evaluation data and information, including proposals, is essential in order to preserve the integrity of the proposal evaluation process. During the selection process, no member or advisor of any committee appointed to evaluate proposals shall discuss or disclose any information on the number, identity or content of proposals received to any other party (including supervisors) without the written approval of the CO. 18 U.S.C. 1905 prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of business, confidential or trade secret information unless authorized by law.

        (b) At the initial meeting of the committee, the CO shall brief all members and advisors on the sensitivity of the evaluation process and the prohibition against unauthorized disclosure of information. At this meeting each member and advisor shall sign a Confidentiality Certificate. During the proposal evaluation process, all proposals, evaluation notes, scoring sheets, and other materials shall be locked in file cabinets or drawers when not in use by committee members and advisors.

        (c) The CO shall be the single point of contact regarding communications received from outside parties relating to the acquisition and the evaluation and selection process. Any committee member or advisor who receives a communication from any outside party shall, without discussion, immediately refer the party to the CO. The CO will then determine what further action shall be taken, if any, in responding to the communication. Requests for information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be referred to the CO for reply. Proposal evaluation committee members and advisors shall not contact any offeror whose proposal is under evaluation. All communications with offerors shall be handled by the CO.

        (d) Bureaus and offices may only release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1) Decisions to release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice shall be approved in writing by the HCA;

        (2) Outside evaluators and advisors shall sign a Conflict of Interest Certificate and a Confidentiality Certificate in a format approved by the HCA;

        (3) Any authorized restrictive legends placed on the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor, or by the Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted information made by the outside evaluator or advisor;

        (4) Upon completing the evaluation, all copies of the proposal, as well as any abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Government office which initially furnished them for evaluation; and

        (5) All determinations to release the proposal outside the Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding individual conflicts of interest (see 1403.101) and organizational conflicts of interest (see 1409.5 and FAR Subpart 9.5), and the competitive relationship, if any, between the prospective contractor or subcontractor and the prospective outside evaluator.

        (e) If outside individuals will be voting members of the evaluation committee or otherwise participate in other than an advisory capacity, then the committee must be constituted as a Federal Advisory Committee in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (PL 92-463) and 308 DM 2. Since the Secretary must appoint such committees in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, there should be very few occasions when use of outside individuals as voting members is justified.

        (f) Outside evaluators will usually serve as advisors to the proposal evaluation committee and as such, are consultants. Consultants may be appointed as special employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3109 or contracted for in accordance with 1437.1.

        (g) Additional restrictions on the disclosure of acquisition evaluation information are listed in FAR Subpart 5.4.

        1415.209   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

        1414.209-70   Examination of records by the Department of the Interior.

#### § 1414.209-70

        The CO shall insert the clause at 1452.215-70, Examination of Records by the Department of the Interior, in all contracts requiring the clause at FAR 52.215-2 Audit and Records, Negotiation, as prescribed in FAR 15.209(b).

        The CO shall initiate an audit by sending a completed form DI-1902, Request for Audit, to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, OIG (see 1453.215-70).

        (a) The CO shall allow at least 30 working days in assigning a realistic deadline for receipt of the audit report. In exceptional circumstances 20 working days may be allowed but the circumstances shall be documented in the contract file.

        (b) Upon receipt of a DI-1902, the OIG will conduct the audit or arrange for its conduct by the cognizant audit agency in accordance with 360 DM 3.7.

        (c) Upon receipt of the audit report, the CO and the price analyst (if assigned), shall discuss any questions regarding the report's contents with the cognizant auditor. If a question cannot be resolved or agreement cannot be reached on a recommendation in the report, the CO shall prepare a written statement for the contract file documenting the decision on the matter. A copy of the statement shall be promptly forwarded to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing for information.

        1415.404-4   Profit.

#### § 1415.404-4

        (a) DOI's policy is to use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee prenegotiation objective in acquisition actions that require cost analysis based on the profit analysis factors in FAR 15.404-4, as implemented and supplemented in this section.

        (b) In addition to the factors listed in FAR 15.404-4(d), one additional factor, “Other Costs,” will be used in evaluating and determining a weighted profit or fee. For further guidance also refer to the Armed Services Pricing Manual (ASPM No. 1). The “Other Costs” factor shall include the contribution of all other direct costs including travel, direct support and hiring of consultants for contract performance.

        1415.406   Documentation.

#### § 1415.406

        1415.406-70   Department of the Interior price negotiation memorandum (PNM).

#### § 1415.406-70

        (a)  In addition to the information required in FAR 15.406-3, the PNM prepared by the CO shall include the information in paragraph (c) of this section to the extent such information is applicable to the negotiation.

        (b)  (1) The CO shall prepare a PNM documenting the negotiation of the initial contract award and any subsequent modifications affecting price, cost or fee, including revisions to the prices of contracts awarded through sealed bidding procedures. A PNM is not required for unilateral modifications such as exercising fixed price options or issuing change orders. The memorandum is required for concluding changes and settlements of claims and for issuing orders under Blanket Ordering Agreements, task orders and delivery orders that involve the negotiation of prices, estimated quantities or amounts.

        (2) For simplified acquisitions conducted pursuant to FAR Part 13, the documentation requirements of 1413.106 and FAR 13.106 shall be followed.

        (c)  When the CO prepares the memorandum prescribed in FAR 15.406-3, the following additional information shall be included to the extent it applies to the contract action. Information already contained in the contract file or in a previous PNM shall be referenced by location:

        (1) A discussion of the reason(s) why sealed bidding is not appropriate as required by FAR 6.401 (or cross-reference the file location of the existing explanation);

        (2) A memorandum identifying the type of contract used and why it was selected as required by FAR 16.103(d). The file location of any required determination and findings authorizing use of this type of contract (see Part 1416);

        (3) A history of the contract action including: Whether the action was synopsized or the basis for exemption under FAR 5.202, and file location of the synopsis; consideration given to the use of set-asides and file location of DI-1886 (see Subpart 1419.2); solicitation issuance date, closing date for receipt of proposals and extensions; (iv) sources solicited (reference file location); late proposal or proposal modification information required by FAR 15.208; and the file location of “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” if applicable.

        (4) Evaluation of proposal(s), including: Evaluation factors used and weights (FAR 15.304); results of initial proposal evaluation (FAR 15.305); determination of competitive range (FAR 15.306); results of written or oral discussions conducted (FAR 15.306); discussion of final proposal revisions received (FAR 15.307) and results of final proposal evaluation; and basis for source selection. For formal source selection procedures (see 1415.303), information on the source selection plan, and the source selection decision including supporting documentation required by FAR 15.308.

        (5) If cost or pricing data were not required, the cost or price analysis performed in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.

        (6) If cost or pricing data were required, the cost analysis (FAR 15.404-1(c)) performed; and cost realism analysis (FAR 15.404-1(d)) and technical analysis (FAR 15.404-1(e)) performed, as applicable to the procurement.

        (7) If an audit report was required (FAR 15.404-2), COs shall specifically describe actions taken in response to significant audit findings, including the monetary value and decisions made with regard to any of the audit's questioned costs; i.e., COs shall identify the value of the questioned costs, indicate whether they will allow or disallow them, and provide an explanation for their decisions.

      Subpart 1437.1—Service Contracts—General

        1437.102   Policy.

#### § 1437.102

        The HCA is responsible for establishing internal review and approval procedures for service contracts in accordance with OFPP Policy Letter 93-1, Management Oversight of Service Contracting. Special attention shall be directed to avoidance of contracting for inherently governmental functions, as well as contract administration in the area of incurred cost monitoring to complement work progress monitoring.

        1437.103   Contracting officer responsibility.

#### § 1437.103

        (a) While recognizing that program officials are responsible for accurately describing the need to be filled or the problem to be solved through the service contract, COs shall:

        (1) Award and administer contracts in a manner that will provide the customer with quality services on time and within budget;

        (2) Ensure that requirements are clearly defined and appropriate performance standards are included in the contract;

        (3) Utilize the checklist in paragraph (b) of this section, or bureau substitute, to ensure compliance with general policies and the specific guidance in OFPP Policy Letters 92-1, Inherently Governmental Functions, 91-2, Service Contracting, and 89-1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants;

        (4) Work in close collaboration with the beneficiaries of the services being purchased to ensure that contractor performance meets contract requirements and performance standards;.

        (b) Following is a checklist to aid analysis and review of requirements for service contracts.

        (1)  (i) Is the statement of work complete, with a clear-cut division of responsibility between the contracting parties?

        (ii) Is it stated in terms the market can satisfy?

        (iii) Does the statement of work encompass all commercially available services that can meet the actual functional need (eliminates any nonessential preferences that may thwart full and open competition)?

        (iv) Is the statement of work performance-based to the maximum extent possible (i.e., is the acquisition structured around the purpose of the work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or a broad and imprecise statement of work? Does the statement of work follow OFPP Pamphlet IV, A Guide to Writing and Administering Performance Statements of Work for Service Contracts (Supplement 2 to OMB Circular A-76)?, as described in OFPP Pamphlet IV?)

        (2)  If the response to the first question below is affirmative, the contract requirement is for an inherently Governmental function that Government officials must perform. If the response to the second question below is affirmative, the contract may be for an inherently governmental function.

        (i) Is the requirement for a function that is listed in Appendix A of OFPP Policy Letter 92-1?

        (ii) If the function is not listed in Appendix A, do any of the factors in the totality of the circumstances analysis discussed in section 7(b) of the Policy Letter 92-1 indicate that the function may be inherently governmental?

        (iii) Are Government employees currently performing the task to be contracted out? If so, has OMB Circular A-76 been consulted?

        (3)  If the response to any of the following questions is negative, the agency may not have a valid requirement or not be obtaining the requirement in the most cost effective manner.

        (i) Is the statement of work written so that it supports the need for a specific service?

        (ii) Is the statement of work written so that it permits adequate evaluation of contractor versus in-house cost and performance?

        (iii) Are the choices of contract type, quality assurance plan, competition strategy, or other related acquisition strategies and procedures in the acquisition plan appropriate to ensure good contractor performance to meet the user's needs?

        (iv) If a cost reimbursement contract is contemplated, is the acquisition plan adequate to ensure that the contractor will have the incentive to control costs under the contract?

        (v) Is the acquisition plan adequate to address the cost effectiveness of using contractor support (either long-term or short-term) versus in-house performance?

        (vi) Is the cost estimate, or other supporting cost information, adequate to enable the contracting office to effectively determine whether costs are reasonable?

        (vii) Is the statement of work adequate to describe the requirement in terms of what is to be performed as opposed to how the work is to be accomplished?

        (viii) Is the acquisition plan adequate to ensure that there is proper consideration given to quality and best value?

        (4)  If the response to any of the following questions is negative, there may be a control problem.

        (i) Are there sufficient resources to evaluate contractor performance when the statement of work requires the contractor to provide advice, analysis and evaluation, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations that could significantly influence agency policy development or decision-making?

        (ii) Does the quality assurance plan provide for adequate monitoring of contractor performance?

        (iii) Is the statement of work written so that it specifies a contract deliverable or requires progress reporting on contractor performance?

        (iv) Is agency expertise adequate to independently evaluate the contractor's approach, methodology, results, options, conclusions or recommendations?

        (v) Is the requirement for a function or service absent from the list in Appendix B of OFPP Policy Letter 92-1? If it is similar to a function or service on that list, greater management scrutiny may be required.

        (5)  If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, there may be a conflict of interest.

        (i) Can the potential offeror perform under the contract in such a way as to devise solutions or make recommendations that would influence the award of future contracts to that contractor?

        (ii) If the requirement is for support services (such as system engineering or technical direction), were any of the potential offerors involved in developing the system design specifications or in the production of the system?

        (iii) Has a potential offeror participated in earlier work involving the same program or activity that is the subject of the present contract wherein the offeror had access to source selection or propriety information not available to other offerors competing for the contract?

        (iv) Will the contractor be evaluating a competitor's work?

        (v) Does the contract allow the contractor to accept its own products or activities on behalf of the Government?

        (vi) Will the work under this contract put the contractor in a position to influence government decision-making,  developing regulations that will affect the contractor's current or future business?

        (vii) Will the work under this contract effect the interests of the contractor's other clients?

        (viii) Are any of the potential offerors, or their personnel who will perform the contract, former agency officials who—while employed by the agency—personally and substantially participated in the development of the requirement for, or the procurement of, these services within the past two years?

        (6)  If the response to any of the following questions is negative, completion may be unnecessarily limited.

        (i) Is the statement of work defined so as to avoid overly restrictive specifications or performance standards?

        (ii) Is the contract formulated in such a way as to avoid creating a continuous and dependent arrangement with the same contractor?

        (iii) Is the use of an indefinite quantity or term contract arrangement appropriate to obtain the required services?

        (iv) Will the requirement be obtained through the use of full and open competition?

        1437.170   Special service contract requirements.

#### § 1480.401

        (a) IA must use the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians or Federally Recognized Tribes whenever the use of that authority is practicable. The Buy Indian Act provides that so far as may be practicable, Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open market at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. Thus, IA may use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring supplies, general services, A&E services, or construction to meet IA needs and requirements. All other FAR and DIAR requirements that do not conflict with this part, such as requirements applicable to the acquisition of A&E and construction services, remain applicable.

        (b) The Buy Indian Act does not apply when a supply requirement can be met by existing inventories of the requiring agency or excess from other agencies.

        (c) The CO will give priority to ISBEEs for all purchases, regardless of dollar value. COs when prioritizing ISBEEs may consider either:

        (1) A set-aside for ISBEEs; or

        (2) A sole source award to an ISBEE, as authorized under the FAR.

        (d) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery, the CO may consider either:

        (1) A set-aside for IEEs; or

        (2) A sole source award to an IEE, as authorized under the FAR.

        (e) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery from ISBEEs or IEEs, then the CO must follow the Deviation process under 1480.403.

        (f) When only one offer is received from a responsible IEE in response to an acquisition set-aside or direct negotiation under paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section:

        (1) If the offer is not at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO may negotiate with that enterprise for a reasonable and fair market price.

        (2) If the offer is at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO must:

        (i) Make an award to that enterprise;

        (ii) Document the reason only one offer was considered; and

        (iii) Initiate action to increase competition in future solicitations.

        (g) If the offers received from one or more responsible IEEs in response to an acquisition set-aside under paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section are not reasonable or otherwise unacceptable, then the CO must follow the deviation process under 1480.403. The CO must document in the deviation determination the reasons why the IEE offeror(s) were not reasonable or otherwise unacceptable.

        (1) If a deviation determination is approved, the CO must cancel the set-aside solicitation and inform all offerors in writing.

        (2) When the solicitation of the same requirement is posted, the CO must inform all previous offerors in writing of the solicitation number.

        1480.402   Delegations and responsibility.

#### § 1480.402

        (a) The Secretary has delegated authority under the Buy Indian Act to the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs. IA exercises this authority in support of its mission and program activities and as a means of fostering Indian employment and economic development.

        (b) The Secretary may delegate authority under the Buy Indian Act to a bureau or office within the Department of the Interior other than IA.

        (c) The Chief Financial Officer of The Office of the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs is responsible for ensuring that all IA acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act comply with the requirements of this part.

        1480.403   Deviations.

#### § 1480.403

        There are certain instances where the application of the Buy Indian Act to an acquisition may not be appropriate. In these instances, the Contracting Officer must detail the reasons in writing and make a deviation determination.

        (a) Sole source acquisitions awarded to an ISBEE or IEE under 1480.401(c)(2) or (d)(2) do not require a deviation determination and comply with the requirements of the Buy Indian Act.

        (b) Some acquisitions by their very nature would make such a written determination unnecessary. The following acquisitions do not require a written deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act:

        (1) Any sole source acquisition justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.3 and DIAR 1406.3 constitutes an authorized deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act.

        (2) Any order or call placed against an indefinite delivery vehicle that already has an approved deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act.

        (c) Deviation determinations are required for all other acquisitions where the Buy Indian Act is applicable and must be approved as follows:

        (d) Deviations may be authorized prior to issuing the solicitation when the CO makes the following determinations and takes the following actions:

        (1) The CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery from two or more responsible ISBEE, IEEs, or direct negotiation with an IEE that is a certified 8a business.

        (2) The deviation determination is authorized by the official listed at 1480.403(c) for the applicable contract action.

        (e) If a deviation determination has been approved, the CO must follow the FAR and DIAR unless specified otherwise.

        (f) Acquisitions made under an authorized deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act must be made in conformance with the order of precedence required by FAR 8.002.

      Subpart 1480.5—Procedures

        (i) Will not give preference under the Buy Indian Act to the IEE; and

        (ii) May extend the date for receipt of offers when practical.

        (2) If more than one IEE is identified subsequent to the solicitation, but prior to the date established for receipt of offers, the CO may cancel the solicitation and re-compete it as an IEE set-aside.

        (e) This paragraph (e) lists the clauses and provisions that must be inserted.

        (2) A description of actions, if any, that must be taken to regain eligibility.

        (e) Failure to provide written notification required by paragraph (d) of this section means that:

        (1) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible as an IEE for future contract awards under this part; and

COs may determine the validity of the contents of the applicant's representation.

        (c) Any false or misleading information submitted by an enterprise when submitting an offer in consideration for an award set aside under the Buy Indian Act is a violation of the law punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

        1480.901   General.

#### § 1480.901

        (a) The CO can accept an offeror's written representation of being an IEE (as defined in 1480.201) only when it is submitted with an offer in response to a solicitation under the Buy Indian Act. Another interested party may challenge the representation of an offeror or contractor by filing a written challenge to the applicable CO in accordance with the procedures in 1480.902.

        (b) After receipt of offers, the CO may question the representation of any offeror in a specific offer by filing a formal objection with the CCO.

        1480.902   Receipt of challenge.

#### § 1480.902

        (a) An interested party must file any challenges against an offeror's representation with the cognizant CO.

        (b) The challenge must be in writing and must contain the basis for the challenge with accurate, complete, specific, and detailed evidence. The evidence must support the allegation that the offeror fails to meet the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” or “Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise” as defined in 1480.201 or is otherwise ineligible. The CO will dismiss any challenge that is deemed frivolous or that does not meet the conditions in this section.

        (c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (1) A challenge may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (2) A written challenge may be delivered by hand, telefax, telegram, email, or letter postmarked within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (3) A CO's challenge to a certification is always considered timely, whether filed before or after award.

        (d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:

        (1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration; and

        (2) Furnish to the offeror (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested or electronic mail.

        (e) Within 3 days after receiving a copy of the challenge and the CO's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file, as specified at paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 days, or another period of time granted by the CO, the CO may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and must not award to the challenged offeror.

        (f) Within 10 days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response, and any other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other expeditious means including by hand, email, telefax, or telegraph if actual delivery can be shown, and make known to all parties the option to appeal the determination to the Director, Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior (PAM).

        (g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by the Director of PAM, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s).

        1480.903   Award in the face of challenge.

#### § 1480.903

        (a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.

        (1) This determination of validity is final unless it is appealed to the Director of PAM and the CO is notified of the appeal before making award.

        (2) If an award was made before the CO received notice of appeal, the award is presumed to be valid.

        (b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation. Award may be made in the face of a timely challenge when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, is urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.

        (c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the solicitation will not be awarded due to a pending challenge. The CO also may ask eligible offerors to extend the period for acceptance of their proposals.

        (d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended or terminated, a mutual no cost agreement will be sought.

        1480.904   Challenge not timely.

#### § 1480.904

        If a CO receives an untimely filed challenge of a representation, the CO must notify the challenger that the challenge cannot be considered on the instant acquisition but will be considered in any future actions. However, the CO may question at any time, before or after award, the representation of an IEE.
