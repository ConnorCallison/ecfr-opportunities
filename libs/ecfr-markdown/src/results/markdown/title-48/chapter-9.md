        (1)  This clause is required in contracts and subcontracts, the performance of which involves or is likely to involve classified information, access to special nuclear materials or the provision of protective services. This includes contracts awarded under simplified acquisition procedures, as well as National Security Program contracts, under which access to proscribed information is required. Although DOE utilizes the National Industrial Security Program, DOE's security authority is derived from the Atomic Energy Act which contains specific language not found in other agencies' authorities. For this reason, DOE contracts must contain the clause at 952.204-2 rather than the clause at FAR 52.204-2 and Contracting Officers must incorporate DOE Form 470.1 or equivalent.

        (2)  This clause is to be used in all contracts which involve classified information.

        (3)  This clause is required in unclassified research contracts which may involve sharing unclassified information about nuclear technology with certain sensitive foreign nations. The contractor shall be provided at the time of award the listing of nations referenced in DOE Order 142.3, Unclassified Foreign Visits and Assignments Program, or its successor. (The attachment referred to in the clause shall set forth the applicable requirements of the DOE regulations on dissemination of unclassified published and unpublished technical information to foreign nations.)

        (4)  This clause may be used in place of the clauses entitled “Security” and “Classification” in contracts with educational institutions for research work performed in their own institute facilities that are not likely to produce classified information.

        (5)  This solicitation provision should be used in solicitations expected to result in contracts and subcontracts that require employees to possess access authorizations.

        (6)  This clause is required in contracts in which the contractor may have access to computers owned, leased or operated on behalf of the Department of Energy.

        (7)  The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 952.204-74, Counterintelligence, in all contracts that include the clauses at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, and 952.204-70, Classification/Declassification.

        904.7002   Definitions.

#### § 904.7002

        means the prime contract and the subcontract at any tier.

        means the DOE contracting officer.

        means the contractor and the subcontractor at any tier.

        means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use, or store classified information, or special nuclear material.

        means any of the following—

        (1) Foreign government or foreign government agency or instrumentality thereof;

        (2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions;

        (3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S. which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, agency, firm, corporation, or person; or

        (4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.

        means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over an offeror(s) or a contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may possibly result.

        means special nuclear material as defined in 10 CFR 710.5(a).

> [49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002; 74 FR 36361, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7690, Feb. 11, 2011]

        904.7003   Disclosure of foreign ownership, control, or influence.

#### § 904.7003

        (a) If a contract requires a contractor to have a Facility Clearance, DOE must determine whether the contractor is or may be subject to foreign ownership, control or influence before a contract can be awarded.

        (b) If, during the performance of a contract, the contractor comes under FOCI, then the DOE must determine whether a continuation of the Facility Clearance may pose an undue risk to the common defense and security through the possible compromise of that information or material. If the DOE determines that such a threat or potential threat exists, the contracting officer shall consider the alternatives of negotiating an acceptable method of isolating the foreign interest which owns, controls, or influences the contractor or terminating the contract.

        (c) It is essential for the DOE to obtain information about FOCI which is sufficient to help the Department determine whether award of a contract to a person or firm, or the continued performance of a contract by a person or firm, may pose undue risk to the common defense and security. Therefore, the provision specified at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, shall be included in solicitations that involve offeror(s) or contractors that are subject to 904.7001.

        (d) The contracting officer shall not award or extend any contract subject to this subpart, exercise any options under a contract, modify any contracts subject to this subpart, or approve or consent to a subcontract subject to this subpart unless—

        (1) The contractor provides the information required by the solicitation provision at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, and

        (2) The contracting officer has made a positive determination in accordance with 904.7004.

        904.7004   Findings, determination, and contract award or termination.

#### § 904.7004

        (a) Based on the information disclosed by the offeror(s) or contractor, and after consulting with the DOE Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, the contracting officer must determine that award of a contract to an offeror(s) or continued performance of a contract by a contractor will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. The contracting officer need not prepare a separate finding and determination addressing FOCI; however, the memorandum of negotiation shall include a discussion of the applicability of this subpart and the resulting determination.

        (b) In those cases where FOCI does exist, and the DOE determines that an undue risk to the common defense and security may exist, the offeror(s) or contractor shall be requested to propose within a prescribed period of time a plan of action to avoid or mitigate the foreign influences by isolation of the foreign interest.

        (c) The types of plans that a contractor can propose are: measures which provide for physical or organizational separation of the facility or organizational component containing the classified information or special nuclear material; modification or termination of agreements with foreign interests; diversification or reduction of foreign source income; assignment of specific security duties and responsibilities to board members or special executive level committees; or any other actions to negate or reduce FOCI to acceptable levels. The plan of action may vary with the type of foreign interest involved, degree of ownership, and information involved so that each plan must be negotiated on a case by case basis. If the offeror(s) or contractor and the DOE cannot negotiate a plan of action that isolates the offeror(s) or contractor from FOCI satisfactory to the DOE, then the offeror(s) shall not be considered for contract award and affected existing contracts with a contractor shall be terminated.

Circumstances that involve possible criminal or fraudulent activities must be reported to the Office of the Inspector General in accordance with 10 CFR part 1010, Conduct of Employees, § 1010.103, Reporting Wrongdoing.

        (2) At a minimum, referrals for consideration of debarment action should be in writing and should include the following information—

        (i) The recommendation and rationale for the referral;

        (ii) A statement of facts;

        (iii) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of all witnesses, including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and the subject matter of their testimony;

        (iv) A list of parties including the contractor, principals, and affiliates (including last known home and business addresses, zip codes and DUNS Number or other identifying number for an individual);

        (v) DOE's and NNSA's acquisition history with the contractor, including recent experience under contracts and copies of pertinent contracts;

        (vi) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or other fact-finding body; and

        (vii) A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on DOE and NNSA programs. This statement is not required for referrals by the Inspector General.

        (3) Referrals may be returned to the originator for further information or development.

        (b)  Contractors proposed for debarment shall be afforded an opportunity to submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment.

        (1) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Debarring Official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions made by the contractor. If the respondent fails to submit a timely written response to a notice of proposed debarment, the Debarring Official shall notify the respondent in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(e) that the contractor is debarred.

        (2) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the contractor may request a fact-finding hearing to resolve a genuine dispute of material fact. In its request, the contractor must identify the material facts in dispute and the basis for disputing the facts. If the Debarring Official determines that there is a genuine dispute of material fact, the Debarring Official shall appoint, and refer the matter to, a Fact-Finding Official for a fact-finding conference.

        (3)  Upon receipt of a timely request from a contractor proposed for debarment, the Debarring Official shall schedule a meeting between the Debarring Official and the respondent, to be held no later than 30 days from the date the request is received. The Debarring Official may postpone the date of the meeting if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the meeting, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, may present and explain evidence that causes for debarment do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, or duration of a proposed debarment or debarment.

        (4)  The purpose of a fact-finding conference under this section is to provide the respondent an opportunity to dispute material facts through the submission of oral and written evidence; resolve facts in dispute; and provide the Debarring Official with findings of fact based, as applicable, on adequate evidence or on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact-finding conference shall be conducted in accordance with rules consistent with 48 CFR 9.406-3(b). The Fact-Finding Official will notify the affected parties of the schedule for the hearing. The Fact-Finding Official shall deliver written findings of fact to the Debarring Official (together with a transcription of the proceeding, if made) within a certain time period after the hearing record closes as specified by the Fact-Finding Official. The findings shall resolve any disputes over material facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence, if the case involves a proposal to debar, or on adequate evidence, if the case involves a suspension. Since convictions or civil judgments generally establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence, there usually is no genuine dispute over a material fact that would warrant a fact-finding conference for those proposed debarments based on convictions or civil judgments.

        (d)  (4) The Debarring Official's final decision shall be based on the administrative record. In those actions where additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared and included in the final decision. In those cases where the contractor has requested and received a fact-finding conference, the written findings of fact shall be those findings prepared by the Fact-Finding Official. Findings of fact shall be final and conclusive unless, within 15 days of receipt of the findings, the Department or the respondent requests reconsideration, or unless set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Fact-Finding Official shall be provided a copy of the Debarring Official's final decision.

        909.406-70   Requests for reconsideration of debarment.

#### § 909.406-70

        (a) At any time during a period of debarment, a respondent may submit to the Debarring or Suspending Official a written request for reconsideration of the scope, duration, or effects of the suspension/debarment action because of new information or changed circumstances, as discussed at 48 CFR 9.406-4(c).

        (b) In reviewing a request for reconsideration, the Debarring or Suspending Official may, in his or her discretion, utilize any of the procedures (meeting and fact-finding) set forth in 909.406-3 and 909.407-3. The Debarring or Suspending Official's final disposition of the reconsideration request shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why the request has been granted or denied. A notice transmitting a copy of the disposition of the request for reconsideration shall be sent to the respondent.

        (1) Indicted for or suspected, upon adequate evidence, of the causes described in 909.406-2(c)(1);

        (2) On the basis of the causes set forth in 909.406-2(d)(2); or

        909.407-3   Procedures.

#### § 909.407-3

        (b)  (1) In actions based on an indictment, the Suspending Official shall make a decision based upon the administrative record, which shall include submissions made by the contractor in accordance with 909.406-3(b)(1) and 909.406-3(b)(3).

        (2) For actions not based on an indictment, the procedures in 909.406-3(b)(2) and 48 CFR 9.407-3(b)(2) apply.

        (3) Coordination with Department of Justice. Whenever a meeting or fact-finding conference is requested, the Suspending Official's legal representative shall obtain the advice of appropriate Department of Justice officials concerning the impact disclosure of evidence at the meeting or fact-finding conference could have on any pending civil or criminal investigation or legal proceeding. If such Department of Justice official requests in writing that evidence needed to establish the existence of a cause for suspension not be disclosed to the respondent, the Suspending Official shall—

        (i) Decline to rely on such evidence and withdraw (without prejudice) the suspension or proposed debarment until such time as disclosure of the evidence is authorized; or

        (ii) Deny the request for a meeting or fact-finding and base the suspension decision solely upon the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the respondent.

        (e)  In actions in which additional proceedings have been held, following such proceedings, the Suspending Official shall notify respondent, as applicable, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.

        (1) Upon deciding to sustain a suspension, the Suspending Official shall promptly send each affected respondent a notice containing the following information:

        (i) A reference to the notice of suspension, the meeting and the fact-finding conference;

        (ii) The Suspending Official's findings of fact and conclusions of law;

        (iii) The reasons for sustaining a suspension;

        (iv) A reference to the Suspending Official's waiver authority under 909.405;

        (v) A statement that the suspension is effective throughout the Executive Branch as provided in 48 CFR 9.407-1(d);

        (vi) Modifications, if any, of the initial terms of the suspension;

        (vii) A statement that the respondent's name and address will be added to the SAM exclusion; and

        (viii) If less than an entire organization is suspended, specification of the organizational element(s) or individual(s) included within the scope of the suspension.

        (2) If the Suspending Official decides to terminate a suspension, the Suspending Official shall promptly send, by certified mail, return receipt requested, each affected respondent a copy of the final decision required under this section.

#### § 909.504

        (d) The contracting officer shall evaluate the statement by the apparent successful offeror or, where individual contracts are negotiated with all firms in the competitive range, all such firms for interests relating to a potential organizational conflict of interest in the performance of the proposed contract. Using that information and any other credible information, the contracting officer shall make written determination of whether those interests create an actual or significant potential organizational conflict of interest and identify any actions that may be taken to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. In fulfilling their responsibilities for identifying and resolving potential conflicts, contracting officers should avoid creating unnecessary delays, burdensome information requirements, and excessive documentation.

        (e) The contracting officer shall award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated. Before determining to withold award based on organizational conflict of interest considerations, the contracting officer shall notify the offeror, provide the reasons therefor, and allow the offeror a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the conflict of interest cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction, the contracting officer may disqualify the offeror from award and undertake the disclosure, evaluation, and determination process with the firm next in line for award. If the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver shall be submitted in accordance with 909.503. The waiver request and decisions shall be included in the contract file.

#### § 909.507-2

        (a)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.209-72, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, in each solicitation and contract for advisory and assistance services expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (2) Contracting officers may make appropriate modifications where necessary to address the potential for organizational conflicts of interest in individual contracts. Contracting officers shall determine the appropriate term of the bar of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the clause at 952.209-72 and enter that term in the blank provided. In the usual case of a contract for advisory and assistance services a period of three, four, or five years is appropriate; however, in individual cases the contracting officer may insert a term of greater or lesser duration.

        (3) The contracting officer shall include Alternate I with the clause in instances in which a meaningful amount of subcontracting for advisory and assistance services is expected.

        (b) Contracts, which are not subject to part 970 but provide for the operation of a DOE site or facility or environmental remediation of a specific DOE site or sites, shall contain the organizational conflict of interest clause at 952.209-72. The organizational conflicts of interest clause in such contracts shall include Alternate I to that clause.

#### § 915.207

        915.207-70   Handling proposals and information during evaluation.

#### § 915.207-70

        (a) Proposals furnished to the Government are to be used for evaluation purposes only. Disclosure outside the Government for evaluation is permitted only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, the procedures in this subsection.

        (b) While the Government's limited use of proposals does not require that the proposal bear a restrictive notice, proposers should, if they desire to maximize protection of their trade secrets or confidential or privileged commercial and financial information contained in them, apply the restrictive notice prescribed in paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1 to such information. In any event, information contained in proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but the Government assumes no liability for the use or disclosure of information (data) not made subject to such notice in accordance with paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1.

        (c) If proposals are received with more restrictive conditions than those in paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1, the contracting officer or coordinating officer shall inquire whether the submitter is willing to accept the conditions of paragraph (e). If the submitter does not, the contracting officer or coordinating officer shall, after consultation with counsel, either return the proposal or accept it as marked. Contracting officers shall not exclude from consideration any proposals merely because they contain an authorized or agreed to notice, nor shall they be prejudiced by such notice.

        (d) Release of proposal information (data) before decision as to the award of a contract, or the transfer of valuable and sensitive information between competing offerors during the competitive phase of the acquisition process, would seriously disrupt the Government's decision-making process and undermine the integrity of the competitive acquisition process, thus adversely affecting the Government's ability to solicit competitive proposals and award a contract which would best meet the Government's needs and serve the public interest. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, none of the information (data) contained in proposals, except as authorized in this subsection, is to be disclosed outside the Government before the Government's decision as to the award of a contract. In the event an outside evaluation is to be obtained, it shall be only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with the procedures of, this subsection.

        (e)(1) In order to maintain the integrity of the procurement process and to assure that the propriety of proposals will be respected, contracting officers shall assure that the following notice is affixed to each solicited proposal prior to distribution for evaluation:

        (2) The notice at 48 CFR 15.609(d) for unsolicited proposals shall be affixed to a cover sheet attached to each such proposal upon receipt by DOE. Use of the notice neither alters any obligation of the Government, nor diminishes any rights in the Government to use or disclose data or information.

        (f)(1) Normally, evaluations of proposals shall be performed only by employees of the Department of Energy. As used in this section, “proposals” includes the offers in response to requests for proposals, sealed bids, program opportunity announcements, program research and development announcements, or any other method of solicitation where the review of proposals or bids is to be performed by other than peer review. In certain cases, in order to gain necessary expertise, employees of other agencies may be used in instances in which they will be available and committed during the period of evaluation. Evaluators or advisors who are not Federal employees, including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, may be used where necessary. Where such non-Federal employees are used as evaluators, they may only participate as members of technical evaluation committees. They may not serve as members of the Source Evaluation Board or equivalent board or committee.

        (2)(i) Pursuant to section 6002 of Pub. L. 103-355, a determination is required for every competitive procurement as to whether sufficient DOE personnel with the necessary training and capabilities are available to evaluate the proposals that will be received. This determination, discussed at 48 CFR 37.204, shall be made in the memorandum appointing the technical evaluation committee by the Source Selection Official, in the case of Source Evaluation Board procurements, or by the Contracting Officer in all other procurements.

        (ii) Where it is determined such qualified personnel are not available within DOE but are available from other Federal agencies, a determination to that effect shall be made by the same officials in the same memorandum. Should such qualified personnel not be available, a determination to use non-Federal evaluators or advisors must be made in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this subsection.

        (3) The decision to employ non-Federal evaluators or advisors, including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, in Source Evaluation Board procurements must be made by the Source Selection Official with the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity. In all other procurements, the decision shall be made by the senior program official or designee with the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity. In a case where multiple solicitations are part of a single program and would call for the same resources for evaluation, a class determination to use non-Federal evaluators may be made by the Senior Procurement Executive.

        (4) Where such non-Federal evaluators or advisors are to be used, the solicitation shall contain a provision informing prospective offerors that non-Federal personnel may be used in the evaluation of proposals.

        (5) The nondisclosure agreement as it appears in paragraph (f)(6) of this subsection shall be signed before DOE furnishes a copy of the proposal to non-Federal evaluators or advisors, and care should be taken that the required handling notice described in paragraph (e) of this subsection is affixed to a cover sheet attached to the proposal before it is disclosed to the evaluator or advisor. In all instances, such persons will be required to comply with nondisclosure of information requirements and requirements involving Procurement Integrity, see 48 CFR 3.104; with requirements to prevent the potential for personal conflicts of interest; or, where a non-Federal evaluator or advisor is acquired under a contract with an entity other than the individual, with requirements to prevent the potential for organizational conflicts of interest.

        (6) Non-Federal evaluators or advisors shall be required to sign the following agreement prior to having access to any proposal:

        (g) The submitter of any proposal shall be provided notice adequate to afford an opportunity to take appropriate action before release of any information (data) contained therein pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); and, time permitting, the submitter should be consulted to obtain assistance in determining the eligibility of the information (data) in question as an exemption under the Act. (See also 48 CFR 24.2, Freedom of Information Act.)

        915.404   Proposal analysis.

#### § 915.404

        915.404-2000   Information to support proposal analysis.

#### § 915.404-2000

        (a)(1) Field pricing assistance as discussed in 48 CFR 15.404-2(a) is not required for the negotiation of DOE contract prices or modifications thereof. The term “field pricing assistance” refers to the Department of Defense (DOD) system for obtaining a price and/or cost analysis report from a cognizant DOD field level contract management office wherein requests for the review of a proposal submitted by an offeror are initiated and the recommendations made by the various specialists of the management office are consolidated into a single report that is forwarded to the office making the contract award for use in conducting negotiations. In the DOE, such review activities, except for reviews performed by professional auditors, are expected to be accomplished by pricing support personnel located in DOE Contracting Activities. The DOE contracting officer shall formally request the assistance of appropriate pricing support personnel, other than auditors, for the review of any proposal that exceeds the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), unless the contracting officer has sufficient data to determine the reasonableness of the proposed cost or price. Such pricing support may be requested for proposals below the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), if considered necessary for the establishment of a reasonable pricing arrangement. Contracting officers, however, are not precluded by this section from requesting pricing assistance from a cognizant DOD contract management office, provided an appropriate cross-servicing arrangement for pricing support services exists between the DOE and the servicing agency.

        (c)(1) When an audit is required pursuant to 915.404-2700, “Audit as an aid in proposal analysis,” the request for audit shall be sent directly to the Federal audit office assigned cognizance of the offeror or prospective contractor. When the cognizant agency is other than the Defense Contract Audit Agency or the Department of Health and Human Services, and an appropriate interagency agreement has not been established, the need for audit assistance shall be coordinated with the Office of Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

        (2)(i) The request for audit shall establish the due date for receipt of the auditor's report and in so doing shall allow as much time as possible for the auditor's review.

        (ii) Copies of technical analysis reports prepared by DOE technical or other pricing support personnel shall not normally be provided to the auditor. The contracting officer or the supporting price, cost, or financial analyst at the contracting activity shall determine the monetary impact of the technical findings.

        915.404-2700   Audit as an aid in proposal analysis.

#### § 915.404-2700

        (a) When a contract price will be based on cost or pricing data submitted by the offerors, the DOE contracting officer or authorized representative shall request a review by the cognizant Federal audit activity prior to the negotiation of any contract or modification including modifications under advertised contracts in excess of—

        (1) The threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1) for a firm fixed-price contract or a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provisions; or adjustment provisions; or

        (2) Twice the threshold at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1) for requiring cost or pricing data for all other contract types, including initial prices, estimated costs of cost-reimbursement contracts, interim and final price redeterminations, and target and settlement of incentive contracts.

        (b) The requirement for auditor reviews of proposals which exceed the thresholds specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived at a level above the contracting officer when the reasonableness of the negotiated contract price can be determined from information already available. The contract file shall be documented to reflect the reason for any such waiver, provided, however, that independent Government estimates of cost or price shall not be used as the sole justification for any such waiver.

> [63 FR 56851, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 36363, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7692, Feb. 11, 2011. Redesignated at 89 FR 89749, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4000   Profit.

#### § 915.404-4000

        (c)(4)(i)  The statutory limitations on price and fee as set forth in 48 CFR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i) shall be followed, except as exempted for DOE architect-engineer contracts covering Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) functions. Pursuant to section 602(d) (13) and (20) of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949, as amended, those former AEC functions, as well as those of the BPA, now being performed by DOE are exempt from the 6 percent of cost restriction on contracts for architect-engineer services. The estimated costs on which the maximum fee is computed shall include facilities capital cost of money when this cost is included in cost estimates.

        (c)(6) In cases where a change or modification calls for substantially different work than the basic contract, the contractor's effort may be radically changed and a detailed analysis of the profit factors would be a necessity. Also, if the dollar amount of the change or contract modification is very significant in comparison to the contract dollar amount, a detailed analysis should be made.

        (d)  A profit/fee analysis technique designed for a systematic application of the profit factors in 48 CFR 15.404-4(d) provides contracting officers with an approach that will ensure consistent consideration of the relative value of the various factors in the establishment of a profit objective and the conduct of negotiations for a contract award. It also provides a basis for documentation of this objective, including an explanation of any significant departure from it in reaching a final agreement. The contracting officer's analysis of these prescribed factors is based on information available prior to negotiations. Such information is furnished in proposals, audit data, performance reports, preaward surveys and the like.

        915.404-4700   DOE structured profit and fee system.

#### § 915.404-4700

        (a) This section implements FAR 15.404-4(b) and (d).

        (b) DOE's structured profit and fee system for non-management and operating contracts comprises two approaches: a weighted guidelines system for all but construction contracts, construction management contracts, and special equipment purchases; and a fee schedules-based system for construction contracts, construction management contracts, and special equipment purchases. The former is covered at 915.404-4720 through 915.404-4780; the latter is covered at 915.404-4800 through 915.404-4860. Both approaches use the procedures at 915.404-4900 for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

> [89 FR 89749, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4710   General.

#### § 915.404-4710

        (a)  It is the intent of DOE to remunerate contractors for financial and other risks which they may assume, resources they use, and organization, performance and management capabilities they employ. Profit or fee shall be negotiated for this purpose; however, when profit or fee is determined as a separate element of the contract price, the aim of negotiation should be to fit it to the acquisition, giving due weight to effort, risk, facilities investment, and special factors as set forth in this subpart.

        (b)  Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives for contracts with commercial (profit) organizations shall be determined as provided in this subpart.

        (c)  It is DOE's general policy to pay fees in contracts with nonprofit organizations other than educational institutions and governmental bodies; however, it is a matter of negotiation whether a fee will be paid in a given case. In making this decision, the DOE negotiating official should consider whether the contractor is ordinarily paid fees for the type of work involved. The profit objective should be reasonable in relation to the task to be performed and the requirements placed on the contractor.

        (d)  It is DOE policy not to pay fees under contracts with educational institutions.

        (e)  Profit or fee shall not be paid under contracts with State, local, and Indian tribal Governments.

        915.404-4720   Weighted guidelines system.

#### § 915.404-4720

        (a) To properly reflect differences among contracts and the circumstances relating thereto and to select an appropriate relative profit/fee in consideration of these differences and circumstances, weightings have been developed for application by the contracting officer to standard measurement bases representative of the prescribed profit factors cited in 48 CFR 15.404-4(d) and paragraph (d) of this section. This is a structured system, referred to as weighted guidelines. Each profit factor or subfactor, or component thereof, has been assigned weights relative to their value to the contract's overall effort. The range of weights to be applied to each profit factor is also set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Guidance on how to apply the weighted guidelines is set forth in 915.404-4780.

        (b) Except as set forth in 915.404-4740, the weighted guidelines shall be used in establishing the profit objective for negotiation of contracts where cost analysis is performed.

        (c) The negotiation process does not contemplate or require agreement on either estimated cost elements or profit elements. Accordingly, although the details of analysis and evaluation may be discussed in the fact-finding phase of the negotiation process in order to develop a mutual understanding of the logic of the respective positions, specific agreement on the exact weights of values of the individual profit factors is not required and need not be attempted.

        (d) The factors set forth in the following table are to be used in determining DOE profit objectives. The factors and weight ranges for each factor shall be used in all instances where the weighted guidelines are applied.

> [63 FR 56851, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 36363, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7692, 7693, Feb. 11, 2011. Redesignated and amended at 89749, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4730   Documentation.

#### § 915.404-4730

        Determination of the profit or fee objective, in accordance with this subpart shall be fully documented. Since the profit objective is the contracting officer's pre-negotiation evaluation of a total profit allowance for the proposed contract, the amounts developed for each category of cost will probably change in the course of negotiation. Furthermore, the negotiated amounts will probably vary from the objective and from the pre-negotiation detailed application of the weighted guidelines technique to each element of the contractor's input to total performance. Since the profit objective is viewed as a whole rather than as its component parts, insignificant variations from the pre-negotiation profit objective, as a result of changes to the contractor's input to total performance, need not be documented in detail. Conversely, significant deviations from the profit objective necessary to reach a final agreement on profit or fee shall be explained in the price negotiation memorandum prepared in accordance with 48 CFR 15.406-3.

        915.404-4740   Exceptions.

#### § 915.404-4740

        (a) For contracts not expected to exceed the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), the weighted guidelines need not be used; however, the contracting officer may use the weighted guidelines for contracts below this amount if he or she elects to do so.

        (b) For the following classes of contracts, the weighted guidelines shall not be used—

        (1) Commercialization and demonstration type contracts;

        (2) Management and operating contracts;

        (3) Construction contracts;

        (4) Construction management contracts;

        (5) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplied by subcontractors;

        (6) Termination settlements; and

        (7) Contracts with educational institutions.

        (c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the contracting officer need not use the weighted guidelines in unusual pricing situations where the weighted guidelines method has been determined by the DOE negotiating official to be unsuitable. Such exceptions shall be justified in writing and shall be authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity. The contract file shall include this documentation and any other information that may support the exception.

        (d) If the contracting officer makes a written determination that the pricing situation meets any of the circumstances set forth in this section, other methods for establishing the profit objective may be used. For contracts other than those subject to subpart 917.6, the selected method shall be supported in a manner similar to that used in the weighted guidelines (profit factor breakdown and documentation of profit objectives); however, investment or other factors that would not be applicable to the contract shall be excluded from the profit objective determination. It is intended that the methods will result in profit objectives for noncapital intensive contracts that are below those generally developed for capital intensive contracts.

        915.404-4750   Special considerations—contracts with nonprofit organizations (other than educational institutions).

#### § 915.404-4750

        (a) For purposes of identification, nonprofit organizations are defined as those business entities organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, of which no part of the net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, of which no substantial part of the activities is attempting to influence legislation or participating in any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office, and which are exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        (b) In computing the amount of profit or fee to be paid, the DOE negotiating official shall take into account the tax benefits received by a nonprofit organization. While it is difficult to establish the degree to which a remuneration under any given contract contributes to an organization's overall net profit, the DOE negotiating official should assume that there is an element of profit in any amount to be paid.

        (c) In order to assure consideration of the tax posture of nonprofit organizations during a profit or fee negotiation, the DOE negotiating official shall calculate the fee as for a contract with a commercial concern and then reduce it at least 25 percent. However, depending on the circumstances, the contracting officer may pay profit or fees somewhere between this amount and the appropriate profit or fee as if it were a commercial concern. When this is the case, the contract file shall be documented to specifically state the reason or reasons.

        (d) Where a contract with a nonprofit organization is for the operation of Government-owned facilities, the fee should be calculated using the procedures and schedules applicable to operating contracts as set forth in part 970.

> [63 FR 56851, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 36363, July 22, 2009. Redesignated at 89 FR 89749, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4760   Contracts with educational institutions.

#### § 915.404-4760

        In certain situations the DOE may contract with a university to manage or operate Government-owned laboratories. These efforts are generally apart from, and not in conjunction with, their other activities, and the complexity and magnitude of the work are not normally found in standard university research or study contracts. Such operating contracts are subject to the applicable provisions set forth in part 970.

> [63 FR 56851, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 36363, July 22, 2009; Redesignated at 89 FR 89749, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4770   Alternative techniques.

#### § 915.404-4770

        (a) Profit or fees to be paid on construction contracts and construction management contracts shall be determined in accordance with the applicable profit/fee technique for such contracts set forth in 915.404-4800.

        (b) Profit and fee to be paid on contracts under the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), not using the weighted guidelines, shall be judgmentally developed by the contracting officer by assigning individual dollar amounts to the factors appropriate to DOE profit considerations discussed in 915.404-4720(d).

        (c) Contracts which require only delivery or furnishing of goods or services supplied by subcontractors shall include a fee or profit which, in the best judgment of the contracting officer, is appropriate. It would be expected that there would be a declining relationship of profit/fee dollars in relation to total costs. The higher the cost of subcontracts, for example, the lower the profit/fee ratio to these costs.

        (d) Profit/Fee considerations in termination settlements are often a question of equity. They are a matter of negotiation. They should not, however, exceed what would have otherwise been payable under weighted guidelines had the termination not occurred.

#### § 915.404-4810

        (a) Business concerns awarded a DOE construction or construction management contract shall be paid a profit or fee if requested or solicited. The profit or fee objective for a construction or construction management contract shall be an amount appropriate for the type of effort contained therein. It is the intent of DOE to—

        (1) Reward contractors based on the complexity of work;

        (2) Reward contractors who demonstrate and establish excellent records of performance; and

        (3) Reward contractors who contribute their own resources, including facilities and investment of capital.

        (b) Standard fees or across-the-board agreements will not be used or made. Profit or fee objectives are to be determined for each contract according to the effort or task contracted thereunder.

        (c) Profit or fee payable on fixed-price and cost-reimbursable construction or construction management contracts shall be established in accordance with the appropriate procedures and schedules set forth in this subpart.

        915.404-4830   Factors for determining fees.

#### § 915.404-4830

        (a) The profit policy stated in 915.404-4810(a) reflects, in a broad sense, recognition that profit is compensation to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources (including capital resources), and the assumption of risk that all costs of performance (operating and capital) may not be reimbursable.

        (b) The best approach calls for a structure that allows judgmental evaluation and determination of fee dollars for prescribed factors which impact the need for, and the rewards associated with, fee or profit, as follows—

        (1) Management risk relating to performance, including the—

        (i) Quality and diversity of principal work tasks required to do the job;

        (ii) Labor intensity of the job;

        (iii) Special control problems; and

        (iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;

        (2) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract;

        (3) The relative difficulty of work, including consideration of technical and administrative knowledge, skill, experience and clarity of technical specifications;

        (4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, including the extent to which the contractor contributes plant, equipment, computers, or working capital (labor, etc.);

        (5) Duration of project;

        (6) Size of operation;

        (7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and know-how, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from being enabled to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and

        (8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business in subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.

        (c) The total fee objective and amount for a particular negotiation is established by judgmental considerations of the factors in paragraph (b) of this section, assigning fee values as deemed appropriate for each factor and totaling the resulting amounts.

        (d) In recognition of the complexities of this process, and to assist in promoting a reasonable degree of consistency and uniformity in its application, fee schedules have been developed which set forth maximum fee amounts that contracting activities are allowed to negotiate for a particular transaction without obtaining prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive. In addition, the fee negotiation objective established in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall not exceed the applicable fee schedule amounts without prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive. To facilitate application to a contract, the fee amounts are related to the total cost base which is defined as total operating and capital costs.

        915.404-4840   Considerations affecting fee amounts.

#### § 915.404-4840

        (a) In selecting final fee amounts for the various factors in 915.404-4840 of this section, the DOE negotiating official will have to make several judgments as discussed in this subsection.

        (b) Complexity of a construction project shall be considered by analysis of its major parts. For a project which includes items of work of different degrees of complexity, a single average classification should be considered, or the work should be divided into separate classifications. The following class identifications are appropriate for proper fee determinations.

        (1) —Manufacturing plants involving operations requiring a high degree of design layout or process control; nuclear reactors; atomic particle accelerators; complex laboratories or industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials.

        (2) —Normal manufacturing processes and assembly operations such as ore dressing, metal working plant and simple processing plants; power plants and accessory switching and transformer stations; water treatment plants; sewage disposal plants; hospitals; and ordinary laboratories.

        (3) —Permanent administrative and general service buildings, permanent housing, roads, railroads, grading, sewers, storm drains, and water and power distribution systems.

        (4) —Construction camps and facilities and other construction of a temporary nature.

        (c) Normal management elements of principal tasks relating to a construction contract cover several categories of tasks with differing rates of application throughout the construction period. The principal elements of management effort are outlined in this paragraph. Although each project has a total management value equal to 100% for all elements, the distribution of effort among the various elements will be different for each project due to differences in project character or size. The basic management elements and the normal range of efforts expected to apply for a normal sized project are as follows. When the normally expected effort will not be performed by a contractor, this fact should be considered in arriving at appropriate fee amounts.

        (d) Fee considerations dealing with the duration of a project are usually provided by the consideration given to the degree of complexity and magnitude of the work. In only very unusual circumstances should it be necessary to separately weight, positively or negatively, for the period of services or length of time involved in the project when determining fee levels.

        (e) The size of the operation is to a considerable degree a continuation of the complexity factor, and the degree and amount of work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources. Generally, no separate weighting, positively or negatively, is required for consideration of those factors.

        (f) The degree and amount of work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources affect the level of fees. Reasonable fees should be based on expectations of complete construction services normally associated with a construction or construction management contract. In the case of a construction contract, reduced services can be in the form of excessive subcontracting or supporting acquisition actions and labor relations interfaces being made by the government. If an unusual amount of such work is performed by other than the contractor, it will be necessary to make downward adjustments in the fee levels to provide for the reduction in services required.

        (g) The type of contract to be negotiated and the anticipated contractor cost risk shall be considered in establishing the appropriate fee objective for the contract.

        (h) When a contract calls for the contractor to use its own resources, including facilities and equipment, and to make its own cost investment (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit financing), a positive impact on the fee amount shall be reflected.

        915.404-4850   Fee schedules.

#### § 915.404-4850

        (a) The schedules included in this paragraph, adjusted in accordance with provisions of this section and 915.404-4860, provide maximum fee levels for construction and construction management contracts. The fees are related to the estimated cost (fee base) for the construction work and services to be performed. The schedule in paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the basic fee schedule for construction contracts. The schedule in paragraph (f) of this section sets forth the basic fee schedule for construction management contracts. A separate schedule in paragraph (h) of this section has been developed for determining the fee applicable to special equipment purchases and to reflect a differing level of fee consideration associated with the subcontractor effort under construction management contracts. (See 915.404-4860(c) and (d).

        (b) The schedules cited in paragraph (a) of this section provide the maximum fee amount for a CPFF contract arrangement. If a fixed-price type contract is to be awarded, the fee amount set forth in the fee schedules shall be increased by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the fee base.

        (c) The fee schedule shown in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section assumes a letter of credit financing arrangement. If a contract provides for or requires the contractor to make their own cost investment for contract performance (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit financing), the fee amounts set forth in the fee schedules shall be increased by an amount equal to 5 percent of the fee amount as determined from the schedules.

        (d) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction contracts:

        (e) When using the Construction Contracts Schedule for establishing maximum payable basic fees, the following adjustments shall be made to the Schedule fee amounts for complexity levels, excessive subcontracting, normal contractor services performed by the government or another contractor:

        (1) The target fee amounts, set forth in the fee schedule, shall not be adjusted for a Class A project, which is maximum complexity. A Class B project requires a 10 percent reduction in amounts. Class C and D projects require a 20 percent and 30 percent reduction, respectively. The various classes are defined in 915.404-4840(b).

        (2) The target fee schedule provides for 45 percent of the contract work to be subcontracted for such things as electrical and other specialties. Excessive subcontracting results when such efforts exceed 45 percent of the total contract work. To establish appropriate fee reductions for excessive subcontracting, the negotiating official should first determine the amount of subcontracting as a percentage of the total contract work. Next, the negotiating official should determine a percentage by which the prime contractor's normal requirement (based on a requirement for doing work with its own forces) is reduced due to the excessive subcontracting and, finally, multiply the two percentages to determine a fee reduction factor.

        (3) If acquisition or other services normally expected of the contractor (see 915.404-4-71-4(c)) are performed by the government, or another DOE prime or operating contractor, a fee reduction may also be required. The negotiating official should first determine what percentage of the total procurement or other required services is performed by others. Then the negotiating official should apply this percentage reduction to the normally assigned weightings for the management services or effort as discussed in 915.404-4840(c) to arrive at the appropriate reduction factor.

        (f) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction management contracts:

        (g) When applying the basic Construction Management Contracts Schedule for determining maximum payable fees, no adjustments are necessary to such payable fees for contractor Force account labor used for work which should otherwise be subcontracted until such Force account work exceeds, in the aggregate, 20 percent of the base. Excessive use of Force account work results when such effort exceeds 20 percent of the fee base; and, when this occurs, appropriate fee reductions for such excessive Force account labor shall be computed as follows:

        (1) Determine the percentage amount of Force account work to total contractor effort.

        (2) Determine the percentage amount of subcontract work reduced due to the use of Force account work.

        (3) Multiply the two percentages to determine the fee reduction factor. It is not expected that reductions in the Construction Management Contracts Schedule fee amounts will be made for complexity, reduced requirements and similar adjustments as made for construction contracts.

        (h) The schedule of fees for consideration of special equipment purchases and for consideration of the subcontract program under a construction management contract is as follows:

> [63 FR 56851, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 12227, Mar. 11, 1999; 74 FR 36364, July 22, 2009. Redesignated and amended at 89 FR 89750, Nov. 13, 2024]

        915.404-4860   Fee base.

#### § 915.404-4860

        (a) The fee base shown in the Construction Contracts Schedule and Construction Management Contracts Schedule represents that estimate of cost to which a percentage factor is applied to determine maximum fee allowances. The fee base is the estimated necessary allowable cost of the construction work or other services which are to be performed. It shall include the estimated cost for, but is not limited to, the following as they may apply in the case of a construction or construction management contract:

        (1) Site preparation and utilities.

        (2) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) of buildings and auxiliary facilities.

        (3) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) to complete/construct temporary buildings.

        (4) Design services to support the foregoing.

        (5) General management and job planning cost.

        (6) Labor supervision.

        (7) Procurement and acquisition administration.

        (8) Construction performed by subcontractors.

        (9) Installation of government furnished or contractor acquired special equipment and other equipment.

        (10) Equipment (other than special equipment) which is to become Government property (including a component of Government property).

        (b) The fee base for the basic fee determination for a construction contract and construction management contract shall include all necessary and allowable costs cited in paragraph (a) of this section as appropriate to the type of contract; except, any home office G&A expense paid as a contract cost per cost principle guidance and procedures shall be excluded from the fee base. The fee base shall exclude:

        (1) Cost of land.

        (2) Cost of engineering (A&E work).

        (3) Contingency estimate.

        (4) Equipment rentals or use charges.

        (5) Cost of government furnished equipment or materials.

        (6) Special equipment.

        (c) A separate fee base shall be established for special equipment for use in applying the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work Schedule (see 915.404-4850(h)). The fee base for determination of applicable fees on special equipment shall be based on the estimated purchase price of the equipment.

        (d) The fee base under the Construction Management Contracts Schedule for a maximum basic fee determination for a construction management contract shall be comprised of only the costs of the construction manager's own efforts. However, it is recognized that in the case of construction management contracts, the actual construction work will be performed by subcontractors. In most cases the subcontract awards for the construction work will be made by the construction management contractor. Occasionally the contract may involve management of construction performed under a contract awarded by the Department or by one of the Department's operating contractors. In these cases, the actual cost of the subcontracted construction work shall be excluded from the fee base used to determine the maximum basic fee (under the Construction Management Contracts Schedule) applicable to a construction management contract. A separate fee base for additional allowances (using the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work Schedule) shall be established, which shall be comprised of those subcontract construction costs, special equipment purchases, and other items' costs that are contracted for or purchased by the construction manager.

        915.404-4900   Special considerations for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

#### § 915.404-4900

        (a) When a contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis several special considerations are appropriate. Fee objectives for management and operating contracts or other contracts as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive, including those using the Construction, Construction Management, or Special Equipment Purchases/Subcontract Work schedules from 915.404-4850, shall be developed pursuant to the procedures set forth in970.1504-101 through 970.1504-300. Fee objectives for other cost-plus-award-fee contracts shall be in accordance with 916.405-2 and be developed as follows:

        (1) The base fee portion of the fee objective of an award fee contract may range from 0% up to the 50% level of the fee amount for a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, arrived at by using the weighted guidelines or other techniques (such as those provided in 915.404-4800 for construction and construction management contracts). However, the base amount should not normally exceed 50% of the otherwise applicable fixed fee. In the event this 50% limit is exceeded, appropriate documentation shall be entered into the contract file. In no event shall the base fee exceed 60% of the fixed fee amount.

        (2) The base fee plus the amount included in the award fee pool should normally not exceed the fixed fee (as subjectively determined or as developed from the fee schedule) by more than 50%. However, in the event the base fee is to be less than 50% of the fixed fee, the maximum potential award fee may be increased proportionately with the decreases in base fee amounts.

        (3) The following maximum potential award fees shall apply in award fee contracts: (percent is stated as percent of fee schedule amounts).

        (b) Prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, is required for total fee (base plus award fee pool) exceeding the guidelines in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      Subpart 915.6—Unsolicited Proposals

        915.602   Policy.

#### § 915.602

        (a) Present and future needs demand the involvement of all resources in exploring alternative energy sources and technologies. To achieve this objective, it is DOE policy to encourage external sources of unique and innovative methods, approaches, and ideas by stressing submission of unsolicited proposals for government support. In furtherance of this policy and to ensure the integrity of the acquisition process through application of reasonable controls, the DOE:

        (1) Disseminates information on areas of broad technical concern whose solutions are considered relevant to the accomplishment of DOE's assigned mission areas;

        (2) Encourages potential proposers to consult with program personnel before expending resources in the development of written unsolicited proposals;

        (3) Endeavors to distribute unsolicited proposals to all interested organizations within DOE;

        (4) Processes unsolicited proposals in an expeditious manner and, where practicable, keeps proposers advised as discrete decisions are made;

        (5) Assures that each proposal is evaluated in a fair and objective manner; and, (6) Assures that each proposal will be used only for its intended purpose and the information, subject to applicable laws and regulations, contained therein will not be divulged without prior permission of the proposer.

        915.603   General.

#### § 915.603

        (f) Unsolicited proposals for the performance of support services are, except as discussed in this paragraph, unacceptable as the performance of such services is unlikely to necessitate innovative and unique concepts. There may be rare instances in which an unsolicited proposal offers an innovative and unique approach to the accomplishment of a support service. If such a proposal offers a previously unknown or an alternative approach to generally recognized techniques for the accomplishment of a specific service(s) and such approach will provide significantly greater economy or enhanced quality, it may be considered for acceptance. Such acceptance shall, however, require approval of the acquisition of support services in accordance with applicable DOE Directives and be processed as a deviation to the prohibition in this paragraph.

In addition, in a situation where cost estimating reliability and other factors are such that the negotiation of a separate predetermined incentive sharing arrangement applicable to cost performance is determined both feasible and advantageous, cost incentives may be added. The resulting contract would then be identified as a cost-plus-incentive-fee/award-fee combination type. The goals and evaluation criteria should be results-oriented. The award fee should be concentrated on the end product of the contract, that is, output, be it hardware, research and development, demonstration or services, together with business management considerations. However, input criteria such as equal employment opportunity, small business programs, functional management areas, such as safety, security, etc., should not be disregarded and may be appropriate criteria upon which to base some part of the award fee.

#### § 917.7000

        (a) This subpart sets forth the DOE policy on cost participation by organizations performing research, development, and/or demonstration projects under DOE prime contracts. This subpart does not cover efforts and projects performed for DOE by other Federal agencies.

        (b) Cost participation is a generic term denoting any situation where the Government does not fully reimburse the performer for all allowable costs necessary to accomplish the project or effort under the contract. The term encompasses cost sharing, cost matching, cost limitation (direct or indirect), participation in kind, and similar concepts.

        917.7001   Policy.

#### § 917.7001

        (a) When DOE supports performer research, development, and/or demonstration efforts, where the principal purpose is ultimate commercialization and utilization of the technologies by the private sector, and when there are reasonable expectations that the performer will receive present or future economic benefits beyond the instant contract as a result of performance of the effort, it is DOE policy to obtain cost participation. Full funding may be provided for early phases of development programs when the technological problems are still great.

        (b) In making the determination to obtain cost participation, and evaluating present and future economic benefits to the performer, DOE will consider the technical feasibility, projected economic viability, societal and political acceptability of commercial application, as well as possible effects of other DOE-supported projects in competing technologies.

        (c) The propriety, manner, and amount of cost participation must be decided on a case-by-case basis.

        (d) Cost participation is required for demonstration projects unless exempted by the Under Secretary. Demonstration projects, pursuant to this subpart, include demonstrations of technological advances and field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstrations of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of energy resources.

        (a) It is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals to accelerate the demonstration of the technical, operational, economic, and commercial feasibility and environmental acceptability of particular energy technologies, systems, subsystems, and components. Program opportunity notices will be used to provide information concerning scientific and technological areas encompassed by DOE's programs. DOE shall, from time to time, issue program opportunity notices for proposals for demonstrations of various forms of non-nuclear energy and technology utilization.

        (b) Each program opportunity notice shall as a minimum describe: the goal of the intended demonstration effort; the time schedule for award; evaluation criteria; program policy factors; the amount of cost detail required; and proposal submission information. Program policy factors are those factors which, while not appropriate indicators of a proposal's individual merit (i.e., technical excellence, proposer's ability, cost, etc.), are relevant and essential to the process of choosing which of the proposals received will, taken together, best achieve the program objectives. All such factors shall be predetermined and specified in the notice so as to notify proposers that factors which are essentially beyond their control will affect the selection process.

#### § 917.7300

        (a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program research and development announcement (PRDA) solicitation approach to obtain and select proposals from the private sector for the conduct of research, development, and related activities in the energy field.

        917.7301   Policy.

#### § 917.7301

        917.7301-1   General.

#### § 917.7301-1

        (a) PRDAs shall be used to provide potential proposers with information concerning DOE's interest in entering into arrangements for research, development, and related projects in specified areas of interest. It is DOE's intent to solicit the submission of ideas which will serve as a basis for research, development, and related activities in the energy field. It is DOE's desire to encourage the involvement of small business concerns, small disadvantage business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns in research and development undertaken pursuant to PRDAs.

        (b) The PRDA should not replace existing acquisition procedures where a requirement can be sufficiently defined for solicitation under standard advertised or negotiated acquisition procedures. Similarly, it should not inhibit or curtail the submission of unsolicited proposals. However, a proposal which is submitted as though it were unsolicited but is in fact germane to an existing PRDA shall be treated as though submitted in response to the announcement or returned without action to the proposer, at the proposer's option. Further, the PRDA is not to be used in a competitive situation where it is appropriate to negotiate a study contract to obtain analysis and recommendations to be incorporated in the subsequent request for proposals.

        922.406   Administration and enforcement.

#### § 922.406

        922.406-1   Policy.

#### § 922.406-1

        This section sets forth additional controls and criteria for the application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements Statute (40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act) (Statute) in the Department of Energy's operational or maintenance activities. The policy included in this subpart applies to M&O contracts.

        (c)  The two categories of work discussed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section would normally be covered by the Statute. However, in limited circumstances, these types of work will be classified as non-covered by the Statute. These exceptions are to be narrowly construed and used only when clearly applicable. Any decision on the two categorical exemptions from Statute coverage shall be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity, without power of delegation.

        (1) Work for which continuity of operations is mission-essential ( when life, property, or DOE operating requirements are confronted with material risks).

        (2) Emergency work to combat the effects of fire, flood, earthquake, military or terrorist attacks, technological emergencies, infectious disease/pandemic influenza threats, equipment failure, accident, or other casualties, and to restart the operational activity following the casualty. This exemption will generally apply only to work directly related to restarting the activity or work.

        (d)  Work items meeting one of the following criteria normally will be classified as non-covered by the Statute:

        (1)  The total dollar amount of a contract is not the determining factor; rather, consider the cost of individual work items classified as construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating. However, no item of work, the cost of which is estimated to be in excess of $2,000, shall be artificially divided into portions less than $2,000 for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Statute.

        (2)  Service-type work that is a part of general operational and maintenance activities, including cyclic, routine, and recurring programs, or which, being very closely and directly involved therewith, are more in the nature of operational activities than construction, alteration, and or repair work.

        (3)  Note: If these activities are a logical part of the construction of a facility, or where there is more than incidental construction work, relative to the overall effort involved, they are Statute covered.

        (4)  This refers to equipment, processes, and devices that are assembled and/or set in place and interconnected for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The nature of the test or experiment may be such that the professional personnel who are responsible for the test or experiment and/or data to be derived therefrom must, by necessity, participate in the assembly and interconnections. The following types of experiments are not Statute covered:

        (i)  Such set-ups are generally not covered by the Statute. (However, set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from connections thereto, is covered by the Statute.)

        (ii)  Assembly of piping and equipment, including adaptation and modification thereof, within existing hot cell facilities to prove out conceptual designs of chemical processing units or remotely controlled machining equipment.

        (iii)  Assembly of materials and equipment for particular aspects of thermonuclear experiments to explore feasibility and to study other ramifications of the concept of high energy and to collect data thereon.

        (iv)  A loop facility differs from a loop set-up in that it is of a more permanent character. (Note that preparatory work for a loop set-up or facility requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from connections thereto, is covered by the Statute. Similarly, material and equipment that are installed for a loop set-up that is a permanent part of the facility, or used for a succession of experimental programs are similarly covered by the Statute.)

        (v)  Such a facility may consist of a reactor vessel, pressurizing tank, coolant loops, pumps, heat exchangers, and other auxiliary equipment as needed. The facility also may include sufficient shielding to permit work on the reactor to proceed following a short period of power interruption. (Note: Although the erection and on-site assembly of such a reactor facility is covered by the Statute, the set-up of components whose characteristics are under study are excluded from Statute coverage.)

        (5)  Decontamination includes washing, scrubbing, and scraping to remove contamination; removal of contaminated soil or other material (except asbestos); and painting or other resurfacing, provided that such painting or resurfacing is an integral part of the decontamination activity. Except to the extent section 1804 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended by Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992), 42 U.S.C. 2297g-3, applies to the work at issue. Section 1804 requires all laborers and mechanics performing decontamination or decommissioning of DOE uranium enrichment facilities are paid prevailing wages.

        (6)  Note, however, that the initial preparatory work readying the burial ground for use ( any grading or excavating that is a part of initial site preparation, fencing, drilling wells for continued monitoring of contamination, construction of guard or other office space) is covered by the Statute. Work performed subsequent to burial that involves the placement of concrete or other like activity is also covered by the Statute.

        (e)  Notwithstanding the exceptions in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the following experimental development work is Statute covered: building construction, structural changes, drilling, tunneling, excavation, back-filling, modifications to utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto, and set-up of equipment to be used for continuous testing ( a machine to be continuously used for testing the tensile strength of structural members).

        (f)  For instance, a contract for operational or maintenance activities does not necessarily mean that all work and activities at the contract location are classifiable as not Statute covered, since it may be necessary to separate work that should be classified as Statute covered. Therefore, the Contracting Officer shall establish and maintain controls for the careful scrutiny of proposed work assignments under such contracts.

        (1) Contractors whose contracts do not contemplate the performance of work covered by the Statute with the contractor's employees are not authorized to perform such work within the scope of the Statute, unless the Contracting Officer, in compliance with FAR subpart 22.4, modifies the contract.

        (2) Determinations of Statute applicability are the responsibility of the HCA on a case-by-case basis. However, the HCA may delegate to the Contracting Officer, if consistent with DOE's responsibilities as described in this subsection, the authority to prescribe, from time to time, classes of work as to which applicability or non-applicability of the Statute is clear.

        (g)  The Contracting Officer shall comply with the procedures for requesting wage determinations set forth in FAR 22.404, as necessary.

        (h)  As DOE-owned property sometimes encompasses several thousand acres of real estate, a number of separate facilities may be located in areas contiguous to each other on the same property. These facilities may be built over a period of years, and established manufacturing activities may be regularly carried on at one site at the same time that construction of another facility is underway at another site. On occasion, the regular manufacturing activities of the operating contractor at the first site may include the manufacture, assembly, and reconditioning of components and equipment that in other industries would normally be done in established commercial plants. While the manufacture of components and equipment in the manufacturing plant is not covered by the Statute, the installation of any such manufactured items on a construction job is covered by the Statute if the installation includes more than incidental construction work relative to the overall effort involved.

        (a) The Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs of the Department of Labor has been delegated authority and responsibility for carrying out the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended. In conjunction with the delegation, contracting officers shall be familiar with existing and any updated provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, and assist the Department of Labor in its compliance responsibilities. DOE contracting officers will include the applicable Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)) and Affirmative Action Program (AAP) requirements in their solicitations and obtain the applicable reports of compliance from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) (when required) prior to awarding of contracts. The provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, are applicable to all DOE contracts.

        (d) The OFCCP requires that requests for pre-award clearances be directed to the OFCCP Regional Office in which the contractor's facility is (to be) located. If OFCCP finds the contractor in compliance, the contracting officer will be notified. Findings of non-compliance can be communicated to the contracting officer by the OFCCP or Headquarters Director or his designee. The appropriate Regional Office will provide the appropriate contact point in cases of non-compliance. The Director, Office of Civil Rights (DOE HQ), when requested, will provide assistance to contracting officers resolving non-compliance issues by providing assistance in obtaining a final decision from the OFCCP.

        922.804   [Reserved]

#### § 922.804

        922.804-1   Nonconstruction.

#### § 922.804-1

        In the event a prospective contractor or subcontractor is entering into its first contract containing the Equal Opportunity clause, the contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor understands and appears able to conform to the requirements of the EEO clause.

        922.804-2   Construction.

#### § 922.804-2

        (a) Construction contracts, including cost-sharing contracts, are subject to OFCCP orders applicable in particular areas.

        (1) When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is within a geographic area where construction is subject to the provisions of Federal EEO Bid Conditions, Part I or Part II, the solicitation shall contain those bid conditions. The contracting officer shall include in such solicitation a provision that “the offeror shall adhere to the affirmative action plan (bid conditions) set forth in this solicitation.”

        (2) Lists of areas for which OFCCP has designated specific affirmative action requirements are available through the Procurement Executive. Contracting officers should assure that this list and copies of pertinent orders are made available to all concerned DOE offices and to DOE contractors and construction subcontractors for work to be performed in the specified geographical areas.

        (b)  (1) When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is not in a “plan area” and is in the amount of $10,000 or more, offerors must agree to comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity clause.

        (2) When proposed nonexempt contracts of $1,000,000 or over are not in plan areas and have not been designated as high impact, offerors also must submit to the contracting officer details regarding specific affirmative action steps to be taken by the offeror in connection with all work under the contract. Such details shall include estimates of the percentage of minority group persons expected to be employed in each craft involved in the performance of the contract work. All solicitations for construction contracts shall reference the affirmative action requirements and the offeror's obligation to make good faith efforts to employ women in craft positions.

        (3) Pursuant to the OFCCP order dated August 30, 1976, agencies shall develop “Special Bid Conditions” for use on high impact projects in non-plan areas. These special bid conditions will include mandatory goals and timetables for the utilization of minorities. The Procurement Executive using the criteria issued by OFCCP will determine those projects that are “high impact.” The contracting officer is responsible for compliance with policies and procedures contained in the OFCCP “Construction Compliance Program Operations Manual.” Language for inclusion in solicitations or contracts contained in the manual may be modified, provided all of the requirements are retained. The contracting officer shall develop the goals and timetables and shall confer with the appropriate OFCCP regional office. The Office of Civil Rights will provide assistance as necessary, when requested. Special bid conditions will be submitted by the contracting officer to the appropriate OFCCP regional office for approval unless otherwise directed by the Procurement Executive. When special bid conditions are applicable, adequate presolicitation lead time should be allowed for submission of the special bid conditions to OFCCP national and regional offices.

        (c) An attempt to limit in any major respect the equal opportunity requirements included in an invitation for bids or request for proposals for a construction contract shall constitute grounds for a determination that the offeror does not qualify as a responsible offeror and for rejection of the bid or proposal. In the case of construction acquisition by DOE prime contractors, this determination shall be made only with the approval of the DOE contracting officer.

        923.170   Policy.

#### § 923.170

        The Department of Energy's (DOE) policy is to promote sustainable acquisition by acquiring products and services that are energy-efficient, contain recycled or biobased content, and have other environmentally preferable attributes, as specified in applicable statutory, regulatory, and Executive Order based requirements.  FAR 2.101 for applicable definitions. More information on environmentally preferable products and services is available from the DOE Sustainable Acquisition Program.

> [89 FR 89752, Nov. 13, 2024]

        923.171   Applicability to contractors.

#### § 923.171

        Many of the Department's major facilities are operated by contractors. Provisions regarding those contracts may be found at part 970 of this chapter. At other locations, the Department makes significant use of contractors to operate and maintain its facilities. As such, the Department encourages the greatest possible use of energy efficient and environmentally sustainable products and services by its facility support contractors. The DOE Sustainable Acquisition Program is to be followed by all contractors operating DOE facilities or motor vehicle fleets.

      Subpart 923.70—Environmental, Energy and Water Efficiency, Renewable Energy Technologies, and Occupational Safety Programs

        923.7001   Nuclear safety.

#### § 923.7001

        The DOE regulates the nuclear safety of its major facilities under its own statutory authority derived from the Atomic Energy Act and other legislation. The DOE also regulates, under certain specific conditions, the use by its contractors of radioactive materials and ionizing radiation producing machines.

> [49 FR 12003, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9106, Feb. 25, 1994; 74 FR 36365, July 22, 2009]

        923.7002   Worker safety and health.

#### § 923.7002

        (a) The Atomic Energy Act mandates that DOE shall either pursue civil penalties, as implemented at 10 CFR part 851, for a violation under 42 U.S.C. 2282c, or a contract fee reduction, but not both. For a contract fee reduction—

        (1) The clause prescribed at §§ 942.71(d) and 923.7003(f), which is 952.242-71, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, or Other Incentives, addresses contract fee reductions (for both non-management and operating contracts and management and operating contracts; for the latter, §§ 942.71(d) and 923.7003(f) refer to clause prescribed in 970.1504-3(b)).

        (2) The clause provides, among other things, for an appropriate reduction to the fee, profit, or other incentives under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns.

        (3) When reviewing performance failures that would warrant a reduction of otherwise earned fee, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. The mitigating factors are specified in the clause.

        (4) The Contracting Officer must obtain the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity: prior to effecting any reduction of fee, profit or other incentives otherwise payable under the clause at 952.942-71, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, or Other Incentives; and prior to determining that no reduction is warranted for performance failure(s) that would otherwise warrant a reduction.

        (b) In the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Department regulation relating to worker safety and health concerns, before deciding to pursue a contract fee reduction, the Contracting Officer must coordinate with the Office of Nuclear Safety within the Office of Enforcement in the Office of Enterprise Assessments (or designated successor office).

> [89 FR 89752, Nov. 13, 2024]

        923.7003   Contract clauses.

#### § 923.7003

        (a) A decision to include or not include environmental, safety and health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer in consultation with appropriate personnel within the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security (or designated successor office). For M&O contracts see 970.2303-3 and insert the clause at 970.5223-1.

        (b) When work is to be performed at a facility where the DOE will exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, shall be used in such contract or subcontract if conditions (b)(1) through (3), are satisfied—

        (1) DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's other work;

        (2) The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety and health services; and

        (3) The facility is government-owned, or leased by or for the account of the government.

        (c) In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and which are a production or utilization facility where there is use or possession of source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials, DOE policy is not to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract but rather to rely upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing requirements (including agreements with States under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act). Pursuant to this policy, neither the clause found at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, is to be incorporated in the contracts or subcontracts for work at such facilities. Notwithstanding this general policy with respect to facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary or his designee may determine in special cases, that DOE needs to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract (see paragraph (d) of this section). When such a determination is made, the clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract or subcontract.

        (d) In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and where there is a machine capable of producing ionizing radiation, it is DOE policy not to regulate such activity where it is adequately regulated by a State or other Federal agency. In such cases, neither clause 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be incorporated in the contract. Where the contracting officer, with appropriate environmental, safety and health advice determines that no State or other Federal agency exists to adequately regulate the operation and/or use of such machines, the clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract. The Assistant Secretary for Health, Safety and Security (or designee) shall be consulted to determine if a non-agreement State or a facility located in a non-agreement State has been reviewed by any other DOE office to establish that the State agency has the essential authority and resources for enforcing the radiation protection standards. This is to assure reasonable consistency in the assessment of radiation protection in non-agreement States and subsequent use of 952.223-72.

        (e) In a situation where the contractor or subcontractor is performing DOE work at more than one location, inclusion of either, or both, 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, and 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, may be appropriate. In such cases, the contract or subcontract must include language to specify the extent of applicability of each clause used. For example, with a parenthetical: (Applicable only to work performed at a contractor site which has 952.223-71 or 952.223-72 clause in its contract or subcontract).

        (f) Unless the clause for management and operating contracts is prescribed (see § 970.1504-3(b)), insert the clause at 952.242-71, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives, in all contracts that contain the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement, or both clauses.

        (g) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-75, Preservation of Individual Occupational Radiation Exposure Records, in contracts containing 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, or 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality.

        925.7002   Policy.

#### § 925.7002

        In selecting offer(s) for award of contracts for nuclear hot cell services, costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and storage and disposal of nuclear waste are to be considered in a way which affords United States and foreign companies an equal competition in accordance with 925.7003. Upon determining that no offer from a foreign firm has a reasonable chance of being selected for award, the requirements of this subpart will not apply.

        925.7003   Requirements.

#### § 925.7003

        (a) For the acquisition of nuclear hot cell services under the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, the selection official in evaluating competitive offers for selection purposes only shall—

        (1) Consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear waste facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste; or

        (2) Add these costs to offers of foreign companies.

        (b) The requirements of this section apply under the following circumstances—

        (1) One or more of the offers is submitted by a United States company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste because it is subject to such costs; and

        (2) One or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and does not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of costs in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)

      Subpart 927.3—Patent Rights Under Government Contracts

        927.302   Policy.

#### § 927.302

        (a)  (1) A primary mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to conduct research, development, and demonstration leading to the ultimate commercialization of efficient sources of energy. To accomplish this mission, DOE must work in cooperation with industry in the development of new energy sources and achieve the ultimate goal of widespread commercial utilization of those energy sources in the shortest practicable time. To this end, Congress has provided DOE with the authority to invoke an array of incentives to secure the commercialization of new technologies developed for DOE. One such important incentive is provided by the patent system.

        (2) Another primary mission of DOE is to manage the Nation's nuclear weapons programs and other classified programs, where research and development procurements are directed toward processes and equipment not available to the public. To support DOE programs for bringing private industry into these and other special programs to the maximum extent permitted by national security and policy considerations, the technology developed in these programs should be made available for use in the particular fields of interest and under controlled conditions by properly cleared industrial and scientific research institutions. To ensure such availability and control, the granting of waivers in these programs may be more limited, either by the imposition of field of use restrictions or national security measures, than in other DOE programs.

        (b)  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908, DOE takes title to all inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under contracts with large, for-profit companies, foreign organizations, and other entities that are not beneficiaries of 35 U.S.C. 200  Regulations dealing with Department's authority to waive its title to subject inventions, including the relevant statutory objectives, exist at 10 CFR part 784. Pursuant to that section, DOE may waive the Government's patent rights in appropriate situations at the time of contracting to encourage industrial participation, foster commercial utilization and competition, and make the benefits of DOE activities widely available to the public. In addition to considering the waiver of patent rights at the time of contracting, DOE will also consider the incentive of a waiver of patent rights upon the reporting of an identified invention when requested by such entities or by the employee-inventor with the permission of the contractor. These requests can be made whether or not a waiver request was made at the time of contracting. Waivers for identified inventions will be granted where it is determined that the patent waiver will be a meaningful incentive to achieving the development and ultimate commercial utilization of inventions. Where DOE grants a waiver of the Government's patent rights, either at the time of contracting or after an invention is made, certain minimum rights and obligations will be required by DOE to protect the public interest.

> [89 FR 89754, Nov. 13, 2024]

        927.302-70   Additional policy.

#### § 927.302-70

        (a) In this section and 927.303,  means a U.S. patent covering an invention or discovery that is not a subject invention (as defined at 35 U.S.C. 201(e)) and that is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of the contract:

        (1) Which the Contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon; and

        (2) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work performed under this contract.

        (b) Except for contracts with organizations that are beneficiaries of Public Law 96-517, the United States, as represented by DOE, shall normally acquire title in and to any invention or discovery conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract, allowing the contractor to retain a nonexclusive, revocable, paid-up license in the invention and the right to request permission to file an application for a patent and retain title to any ensuing patent in any foreign country in which DOE does not elect to secure patent rights. DOE may approve the request if it determines that such approval would be in the national interest. The contractor's nonexclusive license may be revoked or modified by DOE only to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the invention pursuant to any application for and the grant of an exclusive license in the invention to another party.

        (c) Normally, contracts will not include background patent and background data provisions. Under special circumstances, however, to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing to third parties of background inventions, limited rights data or restricted computer software may be included ( 927.303(d)(5)). Inclusion of such a provision will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. A contract may include the right to license the Government and third-party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the Government. The scope of any such background patent or data licensing is subject to negotiation.

        (d) The Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property shall:

        (1) Determine whether reported inventions are subject inventions under the patent rights clause of the contract;

        (2) Determine whether and where patent protection will be obtained on inventions;

        (3) Represent DOE before domestic and foreign patent offices;

        (4) Accept assignments and instruments confirmatory of the Government's rights to inventions; and

        (5) Represent DOE in patent, trademark, technical data, copyright, and other intellectual property matters not specifically reserved to the Head of the Agency or designee under this part.

        (4) For M&O contracts, certain decontamination and decommissioning activities and the building and/or operation of other DOE facilities, see subpart 970.27.

        (d) The Contracting Officer shall use the clause at 952.227-13, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Government, except for—

        (1)  When the services can be expected to involve only “standard types of construction” such as involving previously developed equipment, methods, and processes as described in FAR 27.303(a)(3), the Contracting Officer shall not include a patent clause;

        (2)  In such cases, the Contracting Officer shall use the clause at 37 CFR 401.14, Standard Patent Rights, and Alternate I of 952.227-11 that includes the agency implementing regulations specific for DOE, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all contracts, at any tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, unless the work is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE or another exception (see 37 CFR 401.3(a)). If the Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies executed by DOE on June 7, 2021 (S&E DEC) or any other Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act (DEC) is applicable, the Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 37 CFR 401.14 and Alternate II of 952.227-11;

        (3)  In cases where DOE grants an advance waiver or waives its rights in an identified invention pursuant to 10 CFR part 784, Contracting Officers shall consult with patent counsel on appropriate clauses;

        (4)  In such cases, the Government must be accorded certain rights, applicable to further use of the facility by or on behalf of the Government after contract termination or completion. For such contracts, the Contracting Officer shall include Alternate II with the clause at 952.227-13;

        (5)  For contracts involving DOE background patent rights, the Contracting Officer shall use Alternate I to the clause at 952.227-13. Alternate I may be modified with the concurrence of Patent Counsel in order to reflect the equities of the contracting parties in particular situations; or

        (6)  If the funding program is subject to the S&E DEC, then the Contracting Officer shall use Alternate II to the clause at 952.227-13 when Patent Counsel has determined that the S&E DEC applies to the Contractor's funding and should be included in the contract.

      Subpart 927.4—Rights in Data and Copyrights

        927.400   Scope of subpart.

#### § 927.400

        This subpart sets forth DOE's policy, procedures, and instructions for contract clauses with respect to the acquisition and use of technical data and copyrights in contracts or subcontracts entered into, with or for the benefit of the Government.

        927.401   Definitions.

#### § 927.401

        means data (other than computer software) of a scientific or technical nature. _Technical data_ does not include computer software, but does include manuals and instructional materials and technical data formatted as a computer database (see appendix A to subpart D of 2 CFR part 910).

> [89 FR 89756, Nov. 13, 2024]

        927.402   Policy.

#### § 927.402

        The technical data and scientific and technical information (STI) policies are directed toward achieving the following objectives:

        (a) Making the benefits of the energy research, development and demonstration programs of DOE widely available to the public in the shortest practicable time;

        (b) Promoting the commercial utilization of the technology developed under DOE programs;

        (c) Encouraging participation by private persons in DOE energy research, development, and demonstration programs; and

        (d) Fostering competition and preventing undue market concentration or the creation or maintenance of other situations inconsistent with the antitrust laws.

        927.404-70   Rights in technical data in subcontracts.

#### § 927.404-70

        (a) Prime contractors and higher-tier subcontractors, in meeting their obligations with respect to contract data, must obtain from their subcontractors the rights in, access to, and delivery of such data on behalf of the Government. Accordingly, subject to the policy set forth in this subpart and subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer, where required, prime contractors or higher-tier subcontractors must select appropriate technical data provisions for their subcontracts.

        (1) In many, but not all instances, use of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, as supplemented pursuant to this subpart, in a subcontract will provide for sufficient Government rights in and access to technical data. The inspection rights afforded in Alternate V to the clause at FAR 52.227-14 normally should be obtained only in first-tier subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration work or the furnishing of supplies for which there are substantial technical data requirements as reflected in the prime contract.

        (2) If a subcontractor refuses to accept technical data provisions affording rights in and access to technical data on behalf of the Government, the Contractor shall so inform the Contracting Officer in writing and not proceed with the subcontract award without written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

        (3) In prime contracts or higher-tier subcontracts that contain the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, the Contractor or higher-tier subcontractor must determine whether inclusion of such clause in a subcontract is required to satisfy technical data requirements of the prime contract or higher-tier subcontract.

        (b) As is the case for DOE in its determination of technical data requirements, the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, should not be used at any subcontracting tier where the technical data requirements are fully known. Normally, the clause will be used only in subcontracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, development, or demonstration work. Prime contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in the subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, and they shall not acquire rights to limited rights data or restricted computer software on behalf of the Government for standard commercial items without the prior approval of Patent Counsel.

        927.404-71   Statutory programs.

#### § 927.404-71

        Occasionally, Congress enacts legislation that authorizes or requires the Department to protect from public disclosure specific data first produced in the performance of the contract. Examples of such programs are “the Metals Initiative” and section 3001(d) of the Energy Policy Act. In such cases DOE Patent Counsel is responsible for providing the appropriate contractual provisions for protecting the data in accordance with the statute. Generally, such clauses will be based upon the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, with appropriate modifications to define and protect the “protected data” in accordance with the applicable statute.  When contracts under such statutes are to be awarded, contracting officers must acquire from Patent Counsel the appropriate contractual provisions. Additionally, the contracting officer must consult with DOE program personnel and Patent Counsel to identify data first produced in the performance of the contract that will be recognized by the parties as protected data and what data will be made available to the public notwithstanding the statutory authority to withhold the data from public dissemination.

        927.406   Acquisition of data.

#### § 927.406

        927.406-4   Acquisition and use of technical data.

#### § 927.406-4

        To meet the objectives stated in 927.402, DOE has extensive technical data needs.

        (a) Section 982 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005, 42 U.S.C. 16352) mandates that the Secretary of Energy, through the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, shall maintain within the Department publicly available collections of STI resulting from research, development, demonstration, and commercial-applications activities supported by DOE.

        (b) Section 105 of the DOE Energy Research and Innovation Act (Pub. L. 115-246) further mandates that DOE establish and maintain a public database populated with information on unclassified research and development projects, as well as relevant literature and patents.

        (c) The legal rights in technical data acquired by the Government through DOE contracts, other than management and operating (M&O) contracts ( 970.2704), or contracts involving the production of data necessary for DOE sites/facilities management or operations, are set forth in the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, as supplemented in accordance with this subpart. However, those clauses do not obtain for the Government delivery of any data whatsoever. Rather, known technical data delivery requirements shall be set forth as part of the contract. For Research and Development contracting, requirements for results (conveyed as STI) are addressed in 935.010 and should be set forth in the contract.

        (d) Contracting Officers shall contact Patent Counsel assisting their contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting, negotiating, or approving appropriate data and copyright clauses in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart and FAR subpart 27.4. In particular, Contracting Officers shall seek the advice of Patent Counsel regarding any situation not in conformance with this subpart, including the inclusion or modification of alternate paragraphs of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, as supplemented pursuant to this subpart, the exclusion of specific items from that clause, the exclusion of the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, and the inclusion of any special provisions in a particular contract. Deviations shall follow the requirements in FAR subpart 1.4 and subpart 901.4.

        (e) Contractors are required by Alternate VIII of the clause at 952.227-14, as supplemented pursuant to this subpart, to acquire permission from DOE Patent Counsel to assert copyright in any data including computer software first produced in the performance of the contract. This requirement reflects DOE's established software distribution program, and DOE's statutory dissemination obligations. When a contractor requests permission to assert copyright, Patent Counsel shall predicate its decision on the considerations reflected in paragraph (e) of the clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer.

        (f) In many situations the achievement of DOE's objectives would be frustrated if the Government, at time of award, did not obtain on behalf of responsible third parties and itself limited license rights in and to limited rights data or restricted computer software, or both. Such rights are necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered under the contract. When the contract is for research, development, or demonstration, Contracting Officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel to determine whether such rights should be acquired. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of such organizations have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). In all cases when the Contractor has agreed to include a provision assuring commercial availability of background patents, consideration should be given to securing for the Government and responsible third parties at reasonable royalties and under appropriate restrictions, co-extensive license rights for data, which are limited rights data and restricted computer software.

        927.408   Cosponsored research and development activities.

#### § 927.408

        Because of the Department of Energy's statutory duties to disseminate data first produced under its contracts for research, development, and demonstration, the provisions of FAR 27.408 do not apply to cosponsored or cost shared contracts.

> [63 FR 10506, Mar. 4, 1998]

        927.409   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 927.409

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, and supplement it with Alternates I and V of FAR 52.227-14 and Alternate VIII of FAR 952.227-14, Rights in Data-General, in solicitations and contracts if it is contemplated that data will be produced, furnished, or acquired under the contract. Generally, a contract should contain only one data rights clause. However, where more than one is needed as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the contact should distinguish the portion of contract performance to which each pertains.

        (b)(1) However, the rights in data in specific situations will be treated as described, where the contract is—

        (i) For the production of special works of the type set forth in FAR 27.405-1, the Patent Counsel shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-17, Rights in Data-Special Works, including Alternate I. The clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, may be included in the contract and made applicable to data other than special works, as appropriate (see paragraph (e) of FAR 27.409);

        (ii) For the acquisition of existing data works, as described in FAR 27.405-2 (see paragraph (f) of FAR 27.409);

        (iii) To be performed outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, in which case agencies may prescribe different clauses (see paragraph (i) of FAR 27.409);

        (iv) For architect-engineer services or construction work, in which case the Patent Counsel shall utilize the clause at FAR 52.227-17, Rights in Data-Special Works, including Alternate I;

        (v) A Small Business Innovation Research contract (see paragraph (h) of FAR 27.409);

        (vi) For management and operation of a DOE facility (see 970.2704) or other contracts involving the production of data necessary for the management or operation of DOE facilities or a DOE site, certain decontamination and decommissioning activities, or the building and/or operation of other DOE facilities, after consultation with Patent Counsel (see 927.402-1(b));

        (vii) Awarded pursuant to a statute expressly providing authority for the protection of data first produced thereunder from disclosure or dissemination. (see 927.404-70);

        (viii) For basic or applied research with educational institutions (other than those in which software is specified for delivery unless the software will be released as open source software or other special circumstances exist), the Patent Counsel may use the clause at FAR 52.227-14 with its Alternate IV instead of Alternate VIII of the clause at FAR 952.227-14, Rights in Data-General;

        (ix)(A) Requiring license rights that are deemed necessary, the Patent Counsel should supplement the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, with Alternate VI, as provided at 952.227-14, Rights in Data—General, which will normally be sufficient to cover limited rights data and restricted computer software for items and processes used in the contract and necessary to ensure widespread commercial use or practical utilization of a subject of the contract. The phrase “subject of the contract” in Alternate VI is intended to limit licensing to the fields of technology specifically contemplated under the contract; the phrase may be replaced by a more specific statement of the fields of technology intended to be covered in the manner described in the clause at 952.227-13, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Government.

        (B) Where limited rights data and restricted computer software are the main purpose or basic technology of the research, development, or demonstration effort of the contract (rather than subcomponents, products, or processes ancillary to the contract effort), the limitations in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of Alternate VI of the clause at 952.227-14 should be supplemented or deleted. Paragraph (k) of Alternate VI further provides that limited rights data or restricted computer software may be specified in the contract as being excluded from or not subject to the licensing requirements. This exclusion is implemented by limiting the applicability of the provisions of paragraph (k) of Alternate VI to only those classes or categories of limited rights data and restricted computer software determined essential for licensing. Although contractor licensing may be required under paragraph (k) of Alternate VI, the final resolution of questions regarding the scope of such licenses and the terms thereof, including provisions for confidentiality, and reasonable royalties, is left to the negotiation between the contractor and the Contracting Officer; or

        (x) Where the contractor has access to certain categories of DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, Alternate VII of 952.227-14, Rights in Data-General, shall be used. DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related data and technology. In addition, in any other types of contracting situations in which the contractor may be given access to restricted data owned by DOE, appropriate limitations on the use of such data must be specified.

        (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by a university or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or less.) See FAR 27.406-2. Patent Counsel may use the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, along with the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, to require the contractor to furnish additional technical data, in instances where technical data requirements were not known at the time of award. There is, however, a built-in limitation on the kind of technical data that a contractor may be required to deliver under either the contract or the Additional Data Requirements clause. This limitation is in the withholding provision of paragraph (g) of FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, which provides that the contractor need not furnish limited rights data or restricted computer software. Unless Alternate II or III to the clause at FAR 52.227-14 is used, the Additional Data Rights clause is specifically intended that the contractor may withhold limited rights data or restricted computer software even though a requirement for technical data specified in the contract or called for delivery (pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.227-16) would otherwise require the delivery of such data.

        (m) Contracting officers shall incorporate the solicitation provision at FAR 52.227-23, Rights to Proposal Data (Technical), in all requests for proposals.

        (n) Contracting officers shall include the solicitation provision at 952.227-84 in all solicitations involving research, developmental, or demonstration work.

        means those contractors and subcontractors with contracts exceeding $5,000,000.

        means any action filed by an employee in Federal or state court for redress of a retaliatory act by a contractor and any administrative procedure initiated by an employee under 29 CFR part 24, 48 CFR subpart 3.9, 10 CFR part 708 or 50 U.S.C. 2702.

        means a discharge, demotion, reduction in pay, coercion, restraint, threat, intimidation or other similar negative action taken against an employee by a contractor as a result of an employee's activity protected as a whistleblower activity by a Federal or state statute or regulation.

        (2) For costs associated with employee whistleblower actions where a retaliatory act is alleged against a covered contractor or subcontractor, the contracting officer—

        (i) May authorize reimbursement of costs on a provisional basis, in appropriate cases;

        (ii) Must consult with the Office of General Counsel whistleblower costs point of contact, who will consult with other Headquarters points of contact as appropriate, before making a final allowability determination; and

        (iii) Must determine allowability of defense, settlement and award costs on a case-by-case basis after considering the terms of the contract, relevant cost regulations, and the relevant facts and circumstances, including federal law and policy prohibiting reprisal against whistleblowers, available at the conclusion of the employee whistleblower action.

        (3) Covered contractors and subcontractors must segregate legal costs, including costs of in-house counsel, incurred in the defense of an employee whistleblower action so that the costs are separately identifiable.

        (4) If a contracting officer provisionally disallows costs associated with an employee whistleblower action for a covered contractor or subcontractor, funds advanced by the Department may not be used to finance costs connected with the defense, settlement and award of an employee whistleblower action.

        (5) Contractor defense, settlement and award costs incurred in connection with the defense of suits brought by employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 are excluded from coverage of this section.

      Subpart 932.8—Assignment of Claims

        932.803   Policies.

#### § 932.803

        (d) In the case of prime contracts, when it has been determined that the financing of contracts will be facilitated in the interest of DOE programs, it is the policy of DOE that such contracts provide, or be amended without consideration (see Assignment of Claims Act of 1940) to provide, in conformance with 48 CFR 32.804, that payments to be made to an assignee shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. In the case of subcontracts, when loans are made for the purpose of financing performance of subcontracts under DOE prime contracts, financing institutions or the Government as guarantor in those instances in which such loans are guaranteed should not be required to incur risks of loss by reason of possible diversion of assigned subcontracts proceeds for payment of other claims of the prime contractor against the borrower, otherwise unrelated to the assigned subcontracts. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall require the adoption of these policies and practices by DOE prime contractors with respect to DOE subcontract work. The Head of the Contracting Activity should inform the Chief Financial Officer, Headquarters of each DOE contractor who is unwilling to adopt policies consistent with this paragraph and the reasons given in support of the contractor's position.

      Subpart 932.9—Prompt Payment

        932.970   Implementing DOE policies and procedures.

#### § 932.970

        (a) —(1)  For purposes of determining any interest penalties under cost-type contracts, the effective date of contract settlement shall be the effective date of the final contract modification issued to acknowledge contract settlement and to close out the contract.

        (2)  Where the contracting officer determines, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that it is not reasonable or feasible for DOE to perform the acceptance or approval function within the standard period, the contracting officer should specify a longer constructive acceptance or approval period, as appropriate. Considerations include, but are not limited to, the nature of supplies or services involved, geographical site location, inspection and testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and available DOE resources.

        (b)  Contracting Officers may specify payment due dates that are less than the standard under the Prompt Payment Act when a determination is made, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that a shorter contract financing payment cycle will be beneficial to the Government by reducing the contractor's working capital requirements. In such cases, the Contracting Officer should coordinate with the finance and program officials that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that the contract payment terms to be specified in solicitations and resulting contract awards will provide sufficient time for officials to perform an appropriate review of the invoices before they are paid. Consideration should be given to geographical separation, workload, contractor ability to submit a proper request, and other factors that could affect timing of payment. However, payment due dates that are less than 7 days for progress payments or less than 14 days for interim payments on cost-type contracts are not authorized. In all cases whereby the contract specifies payment due dates that are sooner than those required under the relevant prompt payment requirements, the contract will permit the Contracting Officer to unilaterally authorize additional time for review of invoices if needed to perform an adequate review of those invoices prior to payment.

        (a)(2) The contracting officer shall provide the notice of protest.

        (b)(1) The finding required under FAR 33.104(b)(1) shall be concurred upon by the local DOE counsel with cognizance over the underlying procurement and the Senior Program Official, and approved by the SPE before the HCA authorizes a contract award. The finding shall also address the likelihood that the protest will be sustained by the GAO.

        (c)(2) The finding required by FAR 33.104(c)(2) shall be concurred upon by the local DOE counsel with cognizance over the underlying procurement and the Senior Program Official, and approved by the SPE before the HCA authorizes contract performance.

        (g)  DOE's policy is to comply promptly with the recommendations in Comptroller General decisions unless compelling reasons exist. Any decision to not comply shall be substantiated by the HCA making the award, after approval by the SPE. The report to the GAO regarding a decision to not comply with the GAO's recommendation shall be transmitted to the GAO by the HCA making the award or, if a DOE-wide policy issue is involved, the report shall be provided by the SPE.

        (1) Hold informal discussion with the contractor as appropriate.

        (2) Issue a notice (letter, memo, etc.) to the contractor advising of cost disallowed or to be disallowed and advising the contractor that it may:

        (i) Submit a written claim as to why the cost should be reimbursed—if in disagreement with the disallowance.

        (ii) File a claim under the disputes clause, which will be processed in accordance with disputes procedures in the event disagreements cannot be settled.

        (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the finance office to deduct the disallowed cost when scheduling the voucher for payment.

        (c)  (1) From time to time reports are received from professional auditors that may question the allowability of an incurred cost. Such reports are received as the result of auditors, in their independent role under OMB Circular A-73 or their own charters, scheduling and conducting financial or compliance audits of government contracts or as the result of an independent request for auditor service.

        (2) When auditor reports or other notifications question cost or consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall follow up such reports and resolve all such cost issues promptly by determining, through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor within six months of the audit report date, or date of receipt if a non-Federal audit. One of the following courses of action shall be pursued:

        (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted.

        (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but reject the cost questioned amount.

        (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.

        (iii) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if they are agreed with in principle but there is a difference of opinion as to a proper amount.

        (iv) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if the auditor recommendations are acceptable to the contracting officer but the contractor does not accept the finding or disallowance.

        (v) Issue a final decision of the contracting officer disallowing the questionable cost where differences cannot be resolved, advising of the contractor's right to appeal the decision, and advising the procedure to be followed if it is decided to make such an appeal.

        (vi) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed cost owed the government by:

        (A) Requesting the contractor to provide a credit adjustment (offset) against amounts billed the government on the next or future invoice(s) if such shall be submitted under a contract for which the disallowed cost applies.

        (B) Deducting (offset) the disallowed cost from the next or future invoice(s) submitted under the contract; if the contractor provides no adjustment under the contract for which the disallowed cost applies; provided such reduction is deemed appropriate.

        (C) Advising the contractor that a refund shall be directly payable to the government in situations where there are insufficient payments owed by the government to effect recovery via (A) or (B) above or an offset is otherwise inappropriate.

        (vii) Promptly notify the appropriate finance office of refunds directly payable to the government to ensure proper billing and follow-up action for collection.

        (b) When reviewing performance failures that would warrant a reduction of otherwise earned fee, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. The mitigating factors are specified in the clause. The Contracting Officer must obtain the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity—

        (1) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee, profit or other incentives otherwise payable under the clause at 952.242-71, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, or Other Incentives; and

#### § 950.7003

        (a) Section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, requires DOE “to enter into agreements of indemnification with any person who may conduct activities under a contract with DOE that involve the risk of public liability * * *.” However, DOE contractors whose activities are already subject to indemnification by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are not eligible for such statutory indemnity. See 950.7006 below.

        (b) The Heads of Contracting Activities shall assure that contracts subject to this requirement contain the appropriate nuclear hazards indemnity provisions.

        950.7006   Statutory nuclear hazards indemnity agreement.

#### § 950.7006

        (a) The contract clause contained in 952.250-70 shall be incorporated in all contracts in which the contractor is under risk of public liability for a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation arising out of or in connection with the contract work, including such events caused by a product delivered to a DOE-owned facility for use by DOE or its contractors. The clause at 952.250-70 shall be included in contracts with architect-engineer contractors for the design of a DOE facility, the construction or operation of which may involve the risk of public liability for a nuclear incident or a precautionary evacuation.

        (b) However, this clause shall not be included in contracts in which the contractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or k. of the Act for activities to be performed under the contract.

        950.7010   Financial protection requirements.

#### § 950.7010

        DOE contractors with whom statutory nuclear hazards indemnity agreements under the authority of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, are executed will not normally be required or permitted to furnish financial protection by purchase of insurance to cover public liability for nuclear incidents. However, if authorized by the DOE Headquarters office having responsibility for contractor casualty insurance programs, DOE contractors may be (a) permitted to furnish financial protection to themselves or (b) permitted to continue to carry such insurance at cost to the Government if they currently maintain insurance for such liability.

      Subpart 950.71—General Contract Authority Indemnity

        950.7101   Applicability.

#### § 950.7101

        (a) The DOE also has general contract authority to enter into indemnity agreements with its contractors. Under such authority a certain measure of protection is extended to the DOE contractor against risk of liability, but the assumption of liability by DOE will be expressly subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Prior to enactment of section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act 1954, as amended, this authority was exercised in a number of Atomic Energy Commission contracts and this type of indemnification remains in some DOE contracts.

        (b) It is the policy of the DOE, subsequent to the enactment of section 170, to restrict indemnity agreements with DOE contractors, with respect to protection against public liability for a nuclear incident, to the statutory indemnity provided under section 170. However, it is recognized that circumstances may exist under which a DOE contractor may be exposed to a risk of public liability for a nuclear occurrence which would not be covered by the statutory indemnity.

        (c) While it is normally DOE policy to require its non-management and operating contractors to obtain insurance coverage against public liability for nonnuclear risks, there may be circumstances in which a contractual indemnity may be warranted to protect a DOE non-management and operating contractor against liability for uninsured nonnuclear risks.

        (d) If circumstances as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section do arise, it shall be the responsibility of the Heads of Contracting Activities to submit to the Head of the Agency or designee for review and decision, all pertinent information concerning the need for, or desirability of, providing a general authority indemnity to a DOE contractor.

        (e) Where the indemnified risk is nonnuclear, the amount of general authority indemnity extended to a fixed-price contractor should normally have a maximum obligation equivalent to the amount of insurance that the contractor usually carries to cover such risks in its other commercial operations or, if the risk involved is dissimilar to those normally encountered by the contractor, the amount that it otherwise would have reasonably procured to insure this contract risk.

        (f) In the event that a DOE contractor has been extended both a statutory indemnity and a general authority indemnity, the general authority indemnity will not apply to the extent that the statutory indemnity applies.

        (g) The provisions of this subsection do not restrict or affect the policy of DOE to pay its cost-reimbursement type contractors for the allowable cost of losses and expenses incurred in the performance of the contact work, within the maximum amount of the contract obligation.

        (a)  means information that is classified as Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data or Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or information identified as National Security Information and therefore determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure under E.O. 13526, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or prior or successive Executive orders.

        means the DOE _Contracting Officer_.

        when this clause is used in a subcontract, means subcontract.

        when this clause is included in a subcontract, means subcontractor.

        means any combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications integrated to provide cyber services; examples include business systems, control systems, and access control systems (National Infrastructure Protection Plan, 2009).

        means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but excluding data declassified or removed from the _Restricted Data_ category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2162).

        means information removed from the Restricted Data category based on a joint determination by DOE or its predecessor agencies and the Department of Defense (DoD) that the information—

        (1) Relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons; and

        (2) Can be adequately protected as National Security Information. However, such information is subject to the same restrictions on transmission to other countries or regional defense organizations that apply to Restricted Data.

        means information that has been determined, pursuant to E.O. 13526, Classified _National Security Information_, as amended, or any predecessor or successor order, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and that is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.

        means any program that is established to control access, distribution, and to provide protection for particularly sensitive classified information beyond that normally required for RESTRICTED DATA, TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information.

        means—

        (1) Plutonium, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material that, pursuant to section 51 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2071) has been determined to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or

        (2) Any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.

        (b)  The Contractor shall, in accordance with DOE security regulations and requirements, be responsible for protecting all classified information and all classified matter (including documents, material and special nuclear material) which are in the Contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract against sabotage, espionage, loss or theft. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to DOE any classified matter or special nuclear material in the possession of the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract. If retention by the Contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract, the Contractor shall identify the items and classification levels and categories of matter proposed for retention, the reasons for the retention, and the proposed period of retention. If the retention is approved by the Contracting Officer, the security provisions of the contract shall continue to be applicable to the classified matter retained. Special nuclear material shall not be retained after the completion or termination of the contract.

        (c)  The Contractor shall comply with all security and classification regulations and contract requirements of DOE.

        (d)  (1) The Contractor shall not permit any individual to have access to any classified information, special nuclear material, or Special Access Program (SAP) information, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the DOE's regulations and contract requirements applicable to the particular level and category of classified information or particular category of special nuclear material.

        (2) The Contractor shall conduct a thorough review or background review, as defined at 48 CFR 904.401, of any uncleared applicants or employees, and must test individuals for illegal drugs prior to selecting them for positions requiring DOE access authorizations.

        (i) The review must—(A) Verify applicant's or employee's educational backgrounds, including any high school diplomas obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning;

        (B) Contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references;

        (C) Conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the Contractor is located; and

        (D) Conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.

        (ii) For DOE access authorization, contractor reviews are not required for applicants who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another Federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995, as amended, Access to Classified Information, sections 3.3(c) and (d).

        (iii) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee to a position requiring an access authorization, the Contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders, including those—

        (A) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and

        (B) prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, ADAAA, Title VII and the Older Workers Benefit and Protection Act of 1990, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.

        (iv) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed  in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence from their system of any illegal drug.

        (v) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee receives an offer of employment for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the Contractor shall not place that individual in such a position prior to the individual's receipt of a DOE access authorization, unless an approval has been obtained from the head of the cognizant local DOE security office. If the individual is hired and placed in the position prior to receiving an access authorization, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until an access authorization has been granted.

        (vi) The Contractor must maintain a record of information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization. Upon request only, the following information will be furnished to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office:

        (A) The date(s) each Review was conducted;

        (B) Each entity that provided information concerning the individual;

        (C) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;

        (D) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the Contractor's personnel policies; and

        (E) The results of the test for illegal drugs.

        (vii)  It is understood that disclosure of any classified information relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to protect any classified information, special nuclear material, or other Government property that may come to the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with work under this contract, may subject the Contractor, its agents, employees, or Subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United States (see the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2011  18 U.S.C. 793 and 794).

        (e)  (1) The Contractor shall immediately provide the cognizant security office written notice of any change in the extent and nature of FOCI over the Contractor which would affect any answer to the questions presented in the Standard Form (SF) 328,  executed prior to award of this contract. The Contractor will submit the FOCI information in the format directed by DOE. When completed, the Contractor must sign the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer. In addition, any notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice, shall also be furnished concurrently to the Contracting Officer and to the cognizant security office.

        (2) If a Contractor has changes involving FOCI, DOE must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. In making this determination, DOE will consider proposals made by the Contractor to avoid or mitigate foreign influences.

        (3) If the cognizant security office at any time determines that the Contractor is, or is potentially, subject to FOCI, the Contractor shall comply with such instructions as the Contracting Officer shall provide in writing to protect any classified information or special nuclear material.

        (4) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause or if the Contractor creates a FOCI situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the Contractor becomes subject to FOCI for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the FOCI problem.

        (f)  When placing announcements seeking applicants for positions requiring access authorizations, the Contractor shall include in the written vacancy announcement, a notification to prospective applicants that reviews, and tests for the absence of any illegal drug as defined in 10 CFR 707.4, will be conducted by the employer and a background investigation by the Federal Government may be required to obtain an access authorization prior to employment, and that subsequent reinvestigations may be required. If the position is covered by the Counterintelligence Evaluation Program regulations at 10 CFR part 709, the announcement should also alert applicants that successful completion of a counterintelligence evaluation may include a counterintelligence-scope polygraph examination.

        (g)  The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph and related DOE policies, in all subcontracts that will require subcontractor employees to possess access authorizations.

        Additionally, the Contractor must require such subcontractors to have an existing DOD or DOE facility clearance or submit a completed SF 328,  as required in title 48 of the CFR consistent with the clause at 48 CFR 952.204-73, Facility Clearance, and obtain a foreign ownership, control and influence determination prior to award of a subcontract. Facility clearance may be granted prior to award or after award of a subcontract in accordance with the clause at 48 CFR 952.204-73, Facility Clearance. Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.

        952.204-70   Classification/Declassification.

#### § 952.204-70

        As prescribed in 904.404(d)(2), the following clause shall be included in all contracts which involve classified information:

        (a)  means information that is classified as Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data or Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or information identified as National Security Information and therefore determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure under E.O. 13526, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or prior or successive Executive orders.

        as used in this clause, includes subcontractors.

        means any recorded information, regardless of the nature of the medium or the method or circumstances of recording ( email).

        means facts, data, or knowledge itself.

        means a product or substance that contains or reveals information, regardless of its physical form or characteristics.

        (b) The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of DOE's regulations and DOE directives applicable to work involving the classification and declassification of information, documents, or material. (Note: The decision to classify or declassify information is considered an inherently Governmental function. As such, only Government personnel may serve as Federal Government original classifiers. Both Government and Contractor personnel may serve as derivative classifiers; this involves making decisions based upon classification guidance and, where authorized by DOE directives, portion marked source documents that reflects the decisions of Federal Government. Both Government and Contractor personnel may also serve as derivative declassifiers; this involves making decisions based only on classification guidance).

        (c) The Contractor shall ensure that any document or material that may contain classified information is reviewed by either a derivative classifier, or in the case of documents intended for public release, a classification officer or a specifically designated DC, in accordance with classification regulations, and DOE directives. In accordance with DOE directives DCs must use classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by the DOE or a portion marked source document, when authorized to determine whether it contains classified information prior to dissemination. For information not addressed in classification/declassification guidance, but whose sensitivity appears to warrant classification, the Contractor shall ensure it is reviewed by a Federal Government original classifier or the Director, Office of Classification in accordance with classification directives or regulations.

        (d) The Contractor shall ensure that existing classified documents (containing either Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information, or National Security Information) in its possession or under its control are periodically reviewed by a Federal Government or Contractor derivative declassifier in accordance with classification regulations, DOE directives and classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by DOE to determine if the documents are no longer appropriately classified. Priorities for declassification review of classified documents shall be based on the degree of public and researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review. Documents that no longer contain classified information are to be declassified. Declassified documents then shall be reviewed to determine if they are publicly releasable. Documents that are declassified and determined to be publicly releasable are to be made available to the public in order to maximize the public's access while minimizing security costs.

        (e)  The Contractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract that involves or may involve access to classified information.

        As prescribed in 904.404(d)(5), insert the following provision in all solicitations and contracts which require the use of Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, for contracts or subcontracts subject to the provisions of subpart 904.70:

        Notices to Offerors and the Contract Requirements of the Successful Offeror (Contractor) Section 2536 of title 10, United States Code, prohibits the award of a contract under a national security program to an entity controlled by a foreign government if it is necessary for that entity to be given access to information in a proscribed category of information in order to perform the contract unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of Energy. In addition, a Facility Clearance and foreign ownership, control and influence information are required when the contract or subcontract to be awarded is expected to require employees to have access authorizations.

        An offeror who has either a Department of Defense or a Department of Energy Facility Clearance generally need not resubmit the following foreign ownership, control and influence information unless specifically requested to do so. Instead, provide your DOE Facility Clearance code or your DOD assigned commercial and government entity (CAGE) code. If uncertain, consult the office that issued this solicitation.

        (a)  (1) The contract work to be performed by the successful offeror anticipated by this solicitation will require access to classified information or special nuclear material. Such access will require a Facility Clearance for the Contractor's (that is, the successful offeror's) organization and access authorizations (security clearances) for Contractor personnel working with the classified information or special nuclear material. To obtain a Facility Clearance the Contractor must submit the Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, and all required supporting documents to form a complete Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) Package. The Contractor must submit the FOCI Package in the format directed by DOE. After the FOCI Package is completed, the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer.

        (2) Information submitted by the offeror in the Standard Form 328 will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating foreign ownership, control or influence and will be treated by DOE, to the extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence.

        (3) Following submission of a Standard Form 328 and prior to contract award, the successful offeror/Contractor shall immediately submit to the Contracting Officer written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI information it submitted that could affect its answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Following award of a contract, the Contractor must immediately submit to the cognizant security office written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI information it submitted that could affect its answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Notice of changes in FOCI information that are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice must also be reported concurrently to the cognizant security office.

        (b)  (1)  means any of the following—

        (i) A foreign government, foreign government agency, or representative of a foreign government;

        (ii) Any form of business enterprise or legal entity organized, chartered or incorporated under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions and trust territories; and

        (iii) Any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

        (2)  means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over a Contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may result.

        (c)  means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use or store classified information, or special nuclear material. A _Facility Clearance_ is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for the activities being performed at the facility. It is DOE policy that all Contractors or Subcontractors requiring access authorizations be processed for a Facility Clearance at the level appropriate to the activities being performed under the contract. Approval for a Facility Clearance shall be based upon—

        (1) A favorable foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) determination based upon the Contractor's response to the ten questions in Standard Form 328 and any required, supporting data provided by the Contractor;

        (2) A contract or proposed contract containing the appropriate security clauses;

        (3) Approved safeguards and security plans which describe protective measures appropriate to the activities being performed at the facility;

        (4) An established Reporting Identification Symbol code for the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards Reporting System if access to nuclear materials is involved;

        (5) A survey conducted no more than 6 months before the Facility Clearance date, with a composite facility rating of satisfactory, if the facility is to possess classified matter or special nuclear material at its location;

        (6) Appointment of a Facility Security Officer, who must possess or be in the process of obtaining an access authorization equivalent to the Facility Clearance; and, if applicable, appointment of a Materials Control and Accountability Representative; and

        (7) Access authorizations for key management personnel who will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and who possess or are in the process of obtaining access authorizations equivalent to the level of the Facility Clearance.

        (d)

        (1) A Facility Clearance is required for this contract, although not necessarily prior to contract award. A favorable FOCI determination for this contract is required prior to contract award. It must be rendered by the responsible cognizant security office. The Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.

        (i) The DOE must determine that awarding this contract to the offeror will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security as a result of its access to classified information or special nuclear material in the performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit such additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.

        (ii) Before contract award, after obtaining a favorable FOCI determination, the successful offeror/Contractor may be eligible to obtain a Facility Clearance.

        (iii) If the successful offeror/Contractor does not obtain a Facility Clearance before contract award, after contract award the Contractor shall submit the necessary information to obtain a Facility Clearance and to obtain personnel Interim Access Authorizations in accordance with Departmental policies and procedures.

        (2) The DOE may grant certain of the Contractor's Key Management Personnel and the Contractor's Facility Security Officer Interim Access Authorization. If granted Interim Access Authorization, the Contractor's Key Management Personnel and the Contractor's Facility Security Officer will have access to classified information or special nuclear material.

        (e) A Facility Clearance is required even for contracts that do not require the Contractor's corporate offices to receive, process, reproduce, store, transmit, or handle classified information or special nuclear material, but that require DOE access authorizations for the Contractor's employees to perform work at a DOE location. This type of facility is identified as a non-possessing facility.

        (f) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders (or vendors for purchase orders) requiring access authorizations for access to classified information or special nuclear material. Subcontractors shall be directed to provide responses to the questions in Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, directly to the prime Contractor or the Contracting Officer for the prime contract.

        Prior to submitting the Standard Form 328, required by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, the offeror should review the FOCI submission to ensure that:

        (1) The Standard Form 328 has been signed and dated by an authorized official of the offeror;

        (2) If publicly owned, the Contractor's most recent annual report, and its most recent proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders; or, if privately owned, the audited, consolidated financial information for the most recently closed accounting year has been attached;

        (3) A copy of the company's articles of incorporation and an attested copy of the company's by-laws, or similar documents filed for the company's existence and management, and all amendments to those documents are provided;

        (4) A list identifying the organization's owners, officers, directors, and executive personnel, including their names, social security numbers, citizenship, titles of all positions they hold within the organization, and what clearances, if any, they possess or are in the process of obtaining, and identification of the government agency(ies) that granted or will be granting those clearances; and

        (5) A summary FOCI data sheet is provided.

        A FOCI submission must be attached for each tier parent organization ( ultimate parent and any intervening levels of ownership). If any of these documents are missing, award of the contract cannot be completed.

        As prescribed in 923.7003, insert the following clause:

        (a)  “Employees” means both contractor and subcontractor employees.

        “Safety” encompasses environment, safety and health, including pollution prevention and waste minimization.

        (b) In performing work under this contract, the Contractor shall perform work safely, in a manner that ensures adequate protection for employees, the public, and the environment, and shall be accountable for the safe performance of work. The Contractor shall exercise a degree of care commensurate with the work and the associated hazards. The Contractor shall ensure that management of environment, safety and health (ES&H) functions and activities becomes an integral but visible part of the Contractor's work planning and execution processes. The Contractor shall, in the performance of work, ensure that:

        (1) Line management is responsible for the protection of employees, the public, and the environment. Line management includes those Contractor and subcontractor employees who manage or supervise employees.

        (2) Clear lines of authority and responsibility for ensuring ES&H are established and maintained at all organizational levels.

        (3) Personnel possess the experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are necessary to discharge their responsibilities.

        (4) Resources are effectively allocated to address ES&H, programmatic, and operational considerations. Protecting employees, the public, and the environment is a priority whenever activities are planned and performed.

        (5) Before work is performed, the associated hazards are evaluated and an agreed-upon set of ES&H standards and requirements are established that, if properly implemented, provide adequate assurance that employees, the public, and the environment are protected from adverse consequences.

        (6) Administrative and engineering controls to prevent and mitigate hazards are tailored to the work being performed and associated hazards. Emphasis should be on designing the work and/or controls to reduce or eliminate the hazards and to prevent accidents and unplanned releases and exposures.

        (7) The conditions and requirements to be satisfied for operations to be initiated and conducted are established and agreed-upon by DOE and the Contractor. These agreed-upon conditions and requirements are requirements of the contract and binding upon the Contractor. The extent of documentation and level of authority for agreement shall be tailored to the complexity and hazards associated with the work and shall be established in a Safety Management System.

        (c) The Contractor shall manage and perform work in accordance with a documented Safety Management System that, at a minimum, fulfills all conditions in paragraph (b) of this clause. Documentation of this system shall describe how the Contractor will—

        (1) Define the scope of work;

        (2) Identify and analyze hazards associated with the work;

        (3) Develop and implement hazard controls;

        (4) Perform work within controls; and

        (5) Provide feedback on adequacy of controls and continue to improve safety management.

        (d) The system shall describe how the Contractor will establish, document, and implement safety performance objectives, performance measures, and commitments in response to DOE program and budget execution guidance while maintaining the integrity of the system. The system shall also describe how the Contractor will measure system effectiveness.

        (e) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer documentation of its system for review and approval. Dates for submittal, discussions, and revisions to the system will be established by the Contracting Officer. Guidance on the preparation, content, review, and approval of the system will be provided by the Contracting Officer. On an annual basis, the Contractor shall review and update, for DOE approval, its safety performance objectives, performance measures, and commitments consistent with and in response to DOE's program and budget execution guidance and direction. Resources shall be identified and allocated to meet the safety objectives and performance commitments as well as maintain the integrity of the entire System. Accordingly, the system shall be integrated with the Contractor's business processes for work planning, budgeting, authorization, execution, and change control.

        (f) The Contractor shall comply with, and assist the Department of Energy in complying with, ES&H requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, and applicable directives in accordance with the DOE Directives clause. The Contractor shall cooperate with Federal and non-Federal agencies having jurisdiction over ES&H matters under this contract.

        (g) The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any noncompliance with applicable ES&H requirements and the System. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or the public, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part. Any stop work order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the Contracting Officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause.

        (h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the ES&H requirements applicable to this contract. The Contractor is responsible for flowing down the ES&H requirements applicable to this contract to subcontracts at any tier to the extent necessary to ensure the Contractor's compliance with the requirements.

        (i)  The Contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site at a DOE-owned or-leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) of this clause. Depending on the complexity and hazards associated with the work, the Contractor may choose not to require the subcontractor to submit a Safety Management System for the Contractor's review and approval.

This program shall apply to all products and services acquired in performance of this contract, including first-tier subcontracts, which have reasonable opportunities for environmentally preferable purchasing, consistent with the requirements specified above.

        (b) The Contractor shall coordinate its sustainable acquisition activities and submit any required annual reports at the end of the Government fiscal year, through their Sustainability Coordinator (or equivalent), or as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reporting under this paragraph is only required if the contract offers subcontracting opportunities exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold in any contract year.

        (c)  These provisions shall be flowed down only to first-tier subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that support operation of the DOE facility and offer significant subcontracting opportunities for energy-efficient or environmentally sustainable products or services. When this clause is included in a subcontract, the word “Contractor” will be understood to mean “Subcontractor.”

        (1) The contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subawards, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a domestic small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the contractor in this clause, and the contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subaward, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.

        (2) The contractor will include in all other subawards, regardless of tier, for experimental developmental or research work the patent rights clause directed by the Contracting Officer.

        Replace paragraph (l), Communications, with the following:

        Add the following paragraph:

        (d)(3) Upon breach of paragraph (n) of this Patent Rights clause.

        Replace paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) with the following:

        (g) Subcontracts

        (1) The contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subawards, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a domestic small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the contractor in this clause, and the contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subaward, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.

        (2) The contractor will include in all other subawards, regardless of tier, for experimental developmental or research work the patent rights clause directed by the Contracting Officer.

        Replace paragraph (l), Communications, with the following:

        (l) Communication

        Unless otherwise directed by DOE Patent Counsel, all reports and notifications required by this clause shall be submitted via the iEdison invention management system.

        Add the following paragraphs (n) and (o):

        (n) The Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner,  alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (n) and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (n). The Contractor will include this paragraph (n) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.

        (o) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (n) are further clarified as follows:

        1. Waivers. The Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (n)) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (n). Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that (1) the Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (n)) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (2) a waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.

        2. Final determination of breach of paragraph (n). If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (n), the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions under the award to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer & Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.

        3. Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (n) to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (n): any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (n) suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (n), the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.

        4. For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (n), the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1), unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.

        5. Authority. The requirements and administration of paragraph (n) is in accordance with the Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies executed by DOE on June 7, 2021, or any other applicable DEC. A copy of the DEC is available at  By accepting or acknowledging the award, the Contractor is also acknowledging that it has received a copy of the DEC through the foregoing link. As set forth in 37 CFR 401.4, any nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 affected by any DEC has the right to appeal the imposition of the DEC within thirty (30) working days from the Contractor's acceptance or acknowledgement of this award.

#### § 952.227-13

        As prescribed at 927.303(d), insert the following clause:

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 927.303(d)(5), insert _Alternate I_ under special circumstances to provide for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions:

        (m)  (1)  means a domestic patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject invention, and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of this contract:

        (i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and

        (ii) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work performed under this contract.

        (2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.

        (3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the Contractor.

        (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(3) of this clause, the contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:

        (i) A competitive alternative to the subject matter covered by said background patent is commercially available or readily introducible from one or more other sources; or

        (ii) The Contractor or its licensees are supplying the subject matter covered by said background patent in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices to satisfy market needs or have taken effective steps or within a reasonable time are expected to take effective steps to so supply the subject matter.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 927.303(d), the following modifications must be made when the “Department of Energy Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies” applies:

        The Contracting Officer shall insert the phrase “or upon a breach of paragraph (n) of this clause” after “fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause” in the first sentence of paragraph (d)(1).

        The Contracting Officer shall insert the following paragraph (n):

        (n)  With regard to the license granted in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner,  alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. Should the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the invention(s):

        (1) Undergo a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, or

        (2) Sell, assign, or otherwise transfer title or exclusive rights in the invention(s), then the assignment, license, or other transfer of rights in the subject invention(s) is/are suspended until approved in writing by DOE. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph. The Contractor will include this paragraph in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.

        (1) Such data are not essential to the manufacture or practice of hardware designed or fabricated, or processes developed, under this contract;

        (2) Such data, in the form of results obtained by their use, have a commercially competitive alternate available or readily introducible from one or more other sources;

        As prescribed at 923.7003(f) and 942.71(d), insert the following clause: (Note: If the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, is not included in the contract, the security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information requirements of the clause do not apply; if the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement, is not included in this contract, the environment, safety and health requirements of the clause do not apply.)

        (a)

        (1)  means the quantity the Contracting Officer or fee determining official determines the Contractor is due for its performance prior to a separate determination that the Contractor did not comply with a term or condition of the contract or experienced a failure relating to: environment, safety, and health or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.

        (i) If the contract includes incentives allocable to more than one period, the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for a period includes the allocable amount of payment for each such incentive for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives. Unless stated otherwise, the allocable amount is the total amount divided by the number of periods the incentive covered.

        (2)  means: (the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the period) less (the amount of any reduction under this clause and the amount of any reductions under other clauses to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the period).

        (b)

        (1) ( If the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, is not included in this contract, the security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information requirements of this clause do not apply; if the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement, is not included in this contract, the environment, safety and health requirements of this clause do not apply.)

        The amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for any period under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's and the Contractor's employees' compliance during the period with the performance requirements of this contract relating to:

        (i) environment, safety and health (ES&H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&H); and

        (ii) security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.

        (2) The ES&H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&H terms and conditions, including in some cases a DOE approved contractor (Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&H compliance.

        (3) The security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of this contract are set forth in the clause of this contract entitled, “Security requirements,” the clause (if it is included) of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” and in other terms and conditions.

        (4) If the Contractor does not, in any period, meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&H or security or the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, the Contracting Officer may, per this clause, reduce the amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or other incentives.

        (c)

        (1) If in any period (see paragraph (c)(5) of this clause) the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&H or security or the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, the Contracting Officer will unilaterally determine the amount of reduction to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the period based on the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees of failure specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause. The percent reduction for each performance failure will be: not less than 26% nor more than 100% for a first degree failure; not less than 11% nor more than 26% for a second degree failure; and no more than 11% for a third degree failure.

        (2) For a reduction allocable to more than one period, the Government will make the allocation at the end of the period in which it determines the total amount of the reduction. Unless stated otherwise, the allocable amount is the total reduction amount divided by the number of periods the reduction covered.

        (3) The Government will reduce the payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives as soon as practicable after the end of the period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure when it occurs, it will make the reduction as soon as practical after becoming aware.

        (4) In determining the reduction to the amount of payment and the applicability of mitigating factors, the Contracting Officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&H or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition, guidance for the amount of reduction, or guidance for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the reduction that would be appropriate absent mitigating factors. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following (paragraphs (c)(4)(v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of this clause apply to ES&H only).

        (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.

        (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.

        (iii) Contractor's self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.

        (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&H and compliance in related areas and safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas.

        (v) Contractor's demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&H standards are routinely practiced.

        (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor ( offsite emergency response).

        (vii) Contractor's demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making ( policy, ES&H programs).

        (viii) Contractor's demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.

        (5) The Contracting Officer will, for purposes of this clause, at the time of contract award or as soon as possible after contract award, allocate the total amount of fee, profit, and other incentives that is available under the contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the term of the contract, including options. The amount to be allocated to each period shall equal: (the average monthly amount available during the term of the contact) multiplied by (the number of months for each period).

        (d)

        (1) The amount of the reduction under this clause, in combination with the amount of any reduction under any other clause, shall not exceed the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the period.

        (2) If at any time during the contract any reductions under this clause or other clauses result in the sum of the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives to exceed the sum of the amounts of actually payable to the Contractor, the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government.

        (3) At the end of the contract—

        (i) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of amounts actually payable to the Contractor exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or

        (ii) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of the amounts actually payable to the Contractor.

        (e)  Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&H terms and conditions, including applicable ES&H laws, regulations, DOE directives, and DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or other incentives will be determined are:

        (1) First Degree: Performance failures that are most adverse to ES&H. They include:

        (i) Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS, if an ISMS is required.

        (The Government will perform necessary reviews in a timely manner and not unreasonably withhold approval.)

        (ii) Performance failures determined, per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives to have resulted in, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, serious injury or death to a worker.

        (iii) Occurrence of any accident or event that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) and results in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.

        (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that are significantly adverse to ES&H. They include:

        (i) Failures to comply with an approved ISMS, if an ISMS is required.

        (ii) Failures that have been determined, per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an actual injury, exposure, or exceedance that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences.

        (iii) A breakdown of the Integrated Safety Management System.

        (iv) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in an accident that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) but not resulting in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.

        (v) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives that results in a near miss of an accident or event that could have resulted in an adverse effect and a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board. (A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, that does not result in an adverse effect.)

        (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives to reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&H. They include:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in potential breakdown of the Integrated Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:

        (A) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through external ( Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 231.B (or successor Order) requirements; internal oversight of 10 CFR parts 830, 835, 850, and 851; or DOE Orders 227.1A and 436.1 (or successor Order) requirements.

        (B) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external ( Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.

        (C) Non-compliances that: have, or that may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment; or indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.

        (D) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.

        (f)  Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee, profit, or other incentives occur will be determined are as follows:

        (1) First Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.

        (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret.

        (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this clause).

        (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Secret.

        (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. This category includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions that if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered third degree:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.

        (ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.

        (iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.

        (iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures that unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

#### § 952.250-70

        Insert the following clause in accordance with 950.7006:

        (a)  Except as otherwise specified within this clause, all definitions set forth in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (hereinafter called the Act), shall apply to this clause.

        “Extraordinary nuclear occurrence” means an event that DOE has determined to be such an occurrence, as defined in the Act. A determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence will be made in accordance with the procedures in 10 CFR part 840.

        “Public liability,” referred to below, is public liability as defined in the Act, which (1) arises out of or in connection with the activities under this contract, including transportation; and (2) arises out of or results from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation.

        (b)  This clause is incorporated into this contract pursuant to the authority contained in subsection 170d. of the Act.

        (c)  Except as hereafter permitted or required in writing by DOE, the Contractor will not be required to provide or maintain, and will not provide or maintain at Government expense, any form of financial protection to cover public liability, as described in paragraph (a) of this clause. DOE may, however, at any time require in writing that the Contractor provide and maintain financial protection of such a type and in such amount as DOE shall determine to be appropriate to cover such public liability, provided that the costs of such financial protection are reimbursed to the Contractor by DOE.

        (d)  To the extent that the Contractor and other persons indemnified are not compensated by any financial protection permitted or required by DOE, DOE will indemnify the Contractor and other persons indemnified against (i) claims for public liability as described in paragraph (a) of this clause; and (ii) such legal costs of the Contractor and other persons indemnified as are approved by DOE, provided that DOE's liability, including such legal costs, shall not exceed the amount set forth in section 170e(1)(B) of the Act in the aggregate for each nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation occurring within the United States or $2,000,000,000 in the aggregate for each nuclear incident occurring outside the United States, irrespective of the number of persons indemnified in connection with this contract.

        (e)(1)  In the event of a nuclear incident (as defined in the Act) arising out of nuclear waste activities (as defined in the Act), the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity.

        (2) In the event of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence that—

        (i) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of the construction, possession, or operation of a production or utilization facility; or

        (ii) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of transportation of source material, by-product material, or special nuclear material to or from a production or utilization facility; or

        (iii) Arises out of or results from the possession, operation, or use by the Contractor or a subcontractor of a device utilizing special nuclear material or by-product material, during the course of the contract activity; or

        (iv) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of nuclear waste activities, the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive—

        (A) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant (including the conduct of persons through whom the claimant derives its cause of action) or fault of persons indemnified, including, but not limited to negligence, contributory negligence, assumption of risk, or unforeseeable intervening causes, whether involving the conduct of a third person or an act of God;

        (B) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity; and any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations, if suit is instituted within three years of the date on which the claimant first knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or change and the cause thereof. The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The waiver shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified.

        (v) For the purposes of making a determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, “offsite,” as used in 10 CFR part 840, means “away from the contract location,” a phrase that means any DOE facility, installation, or site at which contractual activity under this contract is being carried out, and any contractor-owned or controlled facility, installation, or site at which the Contractor is engaged in the performance of contractual activity under this contract.

        (3) The waivers set forth in paragraph (e) of this clause—

        (i) Shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action;

        (ii) Shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified;

        (iii) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages;

        (iv) Shall not apply to any injury or damage to a claimant (or claimant's property) that is intentionally sustained by the claimant, or that results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant;

        (v) Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place, if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or occupational disease law;

        (vi) Shall not apply to any claim resulting from a nuclear incident occurring outside the United States;

        (vii) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this clause and in insurance policies, contracts or other proof of financial protection; and

        (viii) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim not within the protection afforded under (A) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170e. of the Act, and (B) the terms of this agreement and the terms of insurance policies, contracts, or other proof of financial protection.

        (f)  The Contractor shall give immediate written notice to DOE of any known action or claim filed or made against the Contractor or other person indemnified for public liability as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause. Except as otherwise directed by DOE, the Contractor shall furnish promptly to DOE copies of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor or filed with respect to such actions or claims. DOE shall have the right to, and may collaborate with, the Contractor and any other person indemnified in the settlement or defense of any action or claim and shall have the right to:

        (1) Require the prior approval of DOE for the payment of any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder; and

        (2) Appear through the Attorney General on behalf of the Contractor or other person indemnified in any action brought upon any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder, take charge of such action, and settle or defend any such action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or claim is undertaken by DOE, the Contractor or other person indemnified shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.

        (g)  The obligations of DOE under this clause shall not be affected by any failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill its obligation under this contract and shall be unaffected by the death, disability, or termination of existence of the Contractor, or by the completion, termination or expiration of this contract.

        (h)  The provisions of this clause shall not be limited in any way by, and shall be interpreted without reference to, any other clause of this contract, including the Disputes clause, provided, however, that this clause is subject to the clauses at 48 CFR 52.203-5, Covenant Against Contingent Fees, and 970.5232-3, Accounts, Records, and Inspection, and any provisions later added to this contract, as required by applicable Federal law, including statutes, Executive orders and regulations, to be included in Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreements.

        (i)  The Contractor and its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to civil penalties, pursuant to section 234A of the Act, for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety related rules, regulations, or orders, and pursuant to section 234C of the Act, for violations of applicable DOE worker safety and health related rules, regulations, and orders. If the Contractor is a not-for-profit contractor, as defined by section 234Ad.(2), the total amount of civil penalties paid shall not exceed the total amount of fees paid within any one-year period (as determined by the Secretary) under this contract.

        (j)  Any individual director, officer, or employee of the Contractor or of its subcontractors and suppliers indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to criminal penalties, pursuant to section 223(c) of the Act, for knowingly and willfully violating the Act, and applicable DOE nuclear safety-related rules, regulations or orders for which violation results in, or if undetected, would have resulted in a nuclear incident.

        (k)  The Contractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract that may involve the risk of public liability, as that term is defined in the Act and further described in paragraph (a) of this clause. However, this clause shall not be included in subcontracts in which the subcontractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or k. of the Act for the activities under the subcontract.

        

        ( ) See note II below for instructions related to this section on Effective Date.

        Relationship to general indemnity

        ( ) See note III below for instructions related to this section on Relationship to General Indemnity.

        (1) For contracts with an award date after August 16, 2012, do not include an effective date provision.

        (2) For contracts with an award date before August 16, 2012—

        (i) If the contract contains the Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement clause (June 1996 or prior version), replace the clause at 952.250-70 with this clause and use the EFFECTIVE DATE title and language, as follows:

        “Effective Date. This contract was awarded on or after August 8, 2005, and at contract award contained the clause at 952.250-70 (JUN 1996) or prior version. That clause has been deleted and replaced with this clause. The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, described by this clause, controls the indemnity for any nuclear incident that occurred on or after August 8, 2005. The Contractor's liability for civil penalties for violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 under this contract is described by paragraph (i) of this clause.

        (ii) If the contract was awarded prior to August 8, 2005, and contains the Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement clause, dated June 1996 or prior version, add this clause in addition to the clause at 952.250-70 or prior version and use the EFFECTIVE DATE title and language, as follows:

        “Effective Date. This contract was in effect prior to August 8, 2005, and contains the clause at 952.250-70 (JUN 1996) or prior version. The indemnity of paragraph (d)(1) is limited to the indemnity provided by the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 for any nuclear incident to which the indemnity applies that occurred before August 8, 2005.

        The indemnity of paragraph (d)(1) of this clause applies to any nuclear incident that occurred on or after August 8, 2005. The Contractor's liability for violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 under this contract is that in effect prior to August 8, 2005.

        The following alternate will be added to the above Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement clause for all contracts that contain a general authority indemnity pursuant to 950.7101. Caution: Be aware that for contracts that will have this provision added, but that do not contain an effective date provision, this paragraph shall be marked (1). In the event an Effective Date provision has been included, it shall be marked (m).

        “() To the extent that the Contractor is compensated by any financial protection, or is indemnified pursuant to this clause, or is effectively relieved of public liability by an order or orders limiting same, pursuant to 170e of the Act, the provisions of the clause providing general authority indemnity shall not apply.”

        970.0100   Scope of part.

#### § 970.0100

        This part provides Departmental policies, procedures, provisions, and clauses that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Chapter 1 of Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) and other parts of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) (Chapter 9 of Title 48 CFR) for the award and administration of the Department's management and operating contracts, as defined at 48 CFR subpart 17.6. The FAR and other parts of the DEAR apply to management and operating contracts. See 970.5200 for guidance regarding which provisions and clauses (from FAR, part 970, or other parts of the DEAR) to include in management and operating contracts. This part does not apply to contracts not designated as M&O contracts by the Secretary of Energy, except as approved by the cognizant Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) or as otherwise prescribed in the DEAR.

        970.0309-1   Applicability.

#### § 970.0309-1

        The contracting officer shall refer to subpart 903.9 regarding the applicability of the DOE Employee Protection Program to management and operating contracts.

        970.0370   Management Controls and Improvements.

#### § 970.0370

        970.0370-1   Policy.

#### § 970.0370-1

        (a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract.

        (b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance with the requirements of the clause at 970.5203-1—

        (1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE;

        (2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of assigned responsibility;

        (3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions;

        (4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use;

        (5) Promote efficient and effective operations;

        (6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract;

        (7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, transactions and assets;

        (8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management controls; and

        (9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being accomplished and that these controls are working effectively.

        (c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement documented performance and quality standards, and management controls and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable specifications.

        (d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The clause at 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by those contractors to address common problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to institute or communicate the improvements. The obligations under the clause in no way affect the contractor's obligations under other provisions of the contract to notify or acquire the approval of the contracting officer.

        The policies in this section are applicable to all DOE management and operating contractors.

        970.0371-3   Definition.

#### § 970.0371-3

        as used in this section, are defined to mean individuals employed by the contractor, both full and part-time, who are assigned to work under a DOE management and operating contract.

        970.0371-4   Gratuities.

#### § 970.0371-4

        Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not, under circumstances which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence the recipients in the conduct of their duties, accept any gratuity or special favor from individuals or organizations with whom the contractor is doing business, or proposing to do business, in accomplishing the work under the contract. Reference is made to the requirements prescribed in 48 CFR 3.502.

        970.0371-5   Use of privileged information.

#### § 970.0371-5

        Management and operating contractor employees shall not use privileged information for personal gain, or make other improper use of privileged information which is acquired in connection with their employment on contract work. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “privileged information” includes but is not limited to, unpublished information relating to technological and scientific developments; medical, personnel, or security records of individuals; anticipated materials' requirements or pricing action; possible new sites for DOE program operations; internal DOE decisions; policy development; and knowledge of selections of contractors or subcontractors in advance of official announcement.

        970.0371-6   Incompatibility between regular duties and private interests.

#### § 970.0371-6

        (a) Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not be permitted to make or influence any decisions on behalf of the contractor which directly or indirectly affect the interest of the Government, if the employee's personal concern in the matter may be incompatible with the interest of the Government. For example: An employee of a contractor will not negotiate, or influence the award of, a subcontract with a company in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest; and an employee of a contractor will not be assigned the preparation of an evaluation for DOE or for any DOE contractor of some technical aspect of the work of another organization with which the individual has an employment relationship, or significant financial interest, or which is a competitor of an organization (other than the contractor who is the individual's regular employer) in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest.

        (b) The contractor shall be responsible for informing employees that they are expected to disclose any incompatibilities between duties performed for the contractor and their private interests and to refer undecided questions to the contractor.

        970.0371-7   Outside employment of contractor employees.

#### § 970.0371-7

        Employees of a management and operating contractor are entitled to the same rights and privileges with respect to outside employment as other citizens. Therefore, there is no general prohibition against contractor employees having outside employment. However, no employee of a contractor performing work on a full or part-time basis under a DOE management and operating contract may engage in employment outside official hours of duty or while on leave if such employment will:

        (a) In any manner interfere with the proper and effective performance of the duties of the position;

        (b) Appear to create a conflict-of-interest situation, or

        (c) Appear to subject DOE or the contractor to public criticism or embarrassment.

        970.0371-8   Employee disclosure concerning other employment services.

#### § 970.0371-8

        (a) Management and operating contractors are responsible for requiring its employees to file with the contractor, a written disclosure statement concerning outside employment services which involve the use of information in the area of the employee's employment with the contractor. The disclosure shall contain such information concerning the outside employment as the contractor may prescribe. As a minimum, the employee's disclosure shall:

        (1) Acknowledge that the employee has read and is familiar with:

        (i) The requirements and restrictions prescribed in this section;

        (ii) Current version of DOE Order 486.1, Department of Energy Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities;

        (iii) Current version of DOE Order 241.1, Scientific and Technical Information Management; and

        (iv) The requirements of the contractor's contract with DOE relating to patents.

        (2) Include information concerning any rate of remuneration significantly in excess of the employee's regular rate of remuneration;

        (3) Identify any actual or potential conflicts with DOE's policies regarding conduct of employees of DOE's contractors set forth in this section;

        (4) Address any potential impacts that such employment may have on the contractor's responsibility to report fully and promptly to DOE all significant research and development information; and

        (5) Identify any potential conflicts such employment may have with the patent provisions of the contractor's contract with DOE.

        (b) The contractor shall provide a copy of all disclosures to the contracting officer.

#### § 970.0470

        970.0470-1   General.

#### § 970.0470-1

        (a) The contractor is required to comply with the requirements of applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, unless relief has been granted by the appropriate authority. For informational purposes, the contracting officer may append the contract with a list of applicable laws or regulations (see 970.5204-2, Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives, paragraph (a)).

        (b) The Department of Energy Directives System is a system of instructions, including orders, notices, manuals, guides, and standards, for Departmental elements. In certain circumstances, requirements contained in these directives may apply to a contractor through operation of a contract clause. Program and requirements personnel are responsible for identifying requirements in the Directives Program which are applicable to a contract, and for developing a list of applicable requirements and providing it to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract.

        (c) Where directives requirements are established using either the Standards/Requirements Identification Process or the Work Smart Standards Process, the applicable process should also be used to establish the environment, safety, and health portion of the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) requirements appropriate for work conducted under a management and operating contract may be determined by a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the associated hazards, and identify an appropriately tailored set of standards, practices, and controls, such as a tailoring process included in a DOE approved Safety Management System implemented under 970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution. When such a process is used, the contracting officer shall ensure that the set of tailored requirements, as approved by DOE pursuant to the process, is incorporated into the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section. These requirements shall supersede, in whole or in part, the contractual environmental, safety, and health requirements previously made applicable to the contract by List B. If the tailored set of requirements identifies an alternative requirement which varies from an ES&H requirement of an otherwise applicable law or regulation, the contractor must request an exemption or other appropriate regulatory relief that may be specified in the governing regulation.

In addition, the contracting officer shall assure that the clause contains appropriate restraints on intra-corporate relations between the contractor's organization and personnel operating the Department's facility and its parent corporate body and affiliates. Such restraints shall include personnel access to the facility, technical transfer of information from the facility, and the availability from the facility of other advantages flowing from performance of the contract. The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that M&O contractors adopt policies and procedures in the award of subcontracts that will meet the Department's need to safeguard against a biased work product and an unfair competitive advantage. To this end, the organizational conflicts of interest clause in management and operating contracts shall include Alternate I. Contracting Officers should refer to Subpart 909.5.

        (b) Department of Energy (DOE) contracts with entities that have been created solely for the purpose of performing a specific management and operating contract. Generally, such newly created entities will have very limited financial and other resources. In such instances, when making the determination of responsibility required under this section, the contracting officer may evaluate the financial resources of other entities only to the extent that those entities are legally bound, jointly and severally if more than one, by means of a performance guarantee or other equivalent enforceable commitment to supply the necessary resources to the prospective contractor and to assume all contractual obligations of the prospective contractor. A performance guarantee should be the means used unless an equivalent degree of commitment can be obtained by an alternative means.

        (c) The guaranteeing corporate entity(ies) must be found to have sufficient resources in order to satisfy its guarantee.

        This subsection sets forth the Department's policies on fees for management and operating (M&O) contracts.

        970.1504-102   Fee policy.

#### § 970.1504-102

        (a)  (1) M&O contracts are typically cost-reimbursement type contracts with incentive fees. An M&O contract, however, may be of any contract type or combination of types (for example, firm-fixed-price, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, multiple-incentive, etc.). Regardless of contract type, an M&O contract may contain work elements using different incentives.

        (2) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract shall only be used if approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) or designee. The fee for a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may not exceed the limits at FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).

        (3) A base fee amount may only be used if approved in advance by the SPE or designee.

        (4) Incentive fees allocated to evaluation periods under cost-reimbursement type contracts should, to the greatest extent appropriate, be tied to a specific portion of the maximum total available fee.

        (5) The maximum total available fee amount may not exceed the fee derived from this subsection unless approved in advance by the SPE or designee. A request to allow a higher fee must be in writing and must clearly explain why the situation merits consideration.

        (i) Typically, only a situation where either unusually difficult objective performance incentives would be used or where successful performance would provide extraordinary value would merit consideration.

        (ii) When a contract requires a contractor to use its own facilities, equipment, or other resources for contract performance ( when there is no letter-of-credit financing), consideration may be given, subject to approval by the SPE or designee, to allowing a maximum total available fee amount above the amount calculated by this subsection.

        (6) Each M&O contract must set forth in the contract (or in a Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) or similar document) the methods that will be used to rate the contractor's performance and to determine the fee the contractor's performance will earn. The DOE Contracting Officer must ensure all important areas of contract performance are specified in the contract or in a PEMP (or similar document), even if such areas are not assigned a specific portion of the maximum total available fee the contractor might earn.

        (i) An M&O contract is an “incentive contract” as that term is used in FAR subpart 16.4. FAR subpart 16.4 prohibits the use in a contract of other than cost incentives without also providing a cost incentive (or constraint).

        (ii) Award fee not earned during the award fee cycle shall not be carried over to any future award fee cycle. Consequently—

        (A) When the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, unearned award fee amounts may not be carried over from one evaluation period to the next.

        (B) When the award fee cycle consists of two or more evaluation periods, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, unearned award fee amounts may be carried over from one evaluation period to the next, so long as the periods are within the same award fee cycle.

        (b) C (1) Before issuing a competitive solicitation, the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) must coordinate the greatest maximum total available fee amount the HCA will accept with the SPE or designee. A competitive solicitation must identify the greatest maximum total available fee amount the Government will accept and may invite offerors to propose a lower fee amount.

        (2) Before beginning to negotiate an extension to an existing contract, the HCA must coordinate the greatest maximum total available fee amount the HCA will accept, and the maximum total available fee amount targeted for negotiation with the SPE or designee.

        970.1504-103   Fee determination.

#### § 970.1504-103

        (a)  Determining the fee of an M&O contract requires considering the:

        (1) Magnitude of the effort;

        (2) Type of the effort;

        (3) Nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work; and

        (4) Specific circumstances of the procurement.

        (b)  (1) Determining the maximum total available fee amount of an M&O contract, which is based upon the fee base (among other things) in each of the one-year periods of the M&O contract, is a separate action from allocating that amount to the evaluation periods of the contract, which is based upon what best motivates the M&O contractor's superior performance. The Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.

        (2) The maximum total available fee amount in an M&O contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts in the contract's one-year periods. (See 970.1504-104 for a complete explanation of the calculation of the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period and an example.)

        (3) The maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is based on the fee base for that one-year period. The fee base is an estimate of the allowable costs (with some exclusions) for that one-year period.

        (4) The fee base is a basic component of the fee schedules, which link the fee base to fee. A fundamental aspect of fee calculations is the amount of the fee base and the amount of fee in the fee schedules are annual amounts. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period starts with determining the fee base for the one-year period. Consequently, a contract's maximum total available fee amount is based on the contract's one-year periods and their fee bases.

        (5) Usually (but not necessarily) once the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is calculated, it is allocated (that is, made available to be earned by the M&O contractor) to the same one-year period. Additionally, when a maximum total available fee amount is established for longer than a year, it is subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than plus or minus ten percent or a lesser percent if appropriate) to the budget or work scope.

        (6) In summary, while the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is based on the fee base for the one-year period, the evaluation period in which the contractor may earn all, or part of that fee need not be the same one-year period or even a single evaluation period. Usually, the length of an evaluation period is one year, mirroring the one-year period used in the calculation of the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period. In fact, the SPE's or designee's approval is required to do otherwise. Nonetheless, the Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. Consequently, there may be occasions where after calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a year, part or all of it should be allocated to a subsequent one-year evaluation period, an evaluation period of greater than a year, or to several evaluation periods.

        (7) Before each year (or other appropriate period), at any time before the year (or period), including as early as the time of contract award, the Contracting Officer and M&O contractor will enter negotiations to establish the requirements for the year (or other appropriate period), including evaluation areas, individual requirements, and the maximum total available fee that the contractor can earn for its performance. If the parties cannot agree, the Contracting Officer will unilaterally establish the requirements and the maximum total available fee. The maximum total available fee allocated to an evaluation period must be apportioned among a base fee amount (which is usually zero) and a performance fee amount. The performance fee amount may consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both. Both performance fee components are “incentives” per FAR subpart 16.4 and both are performance based. The performance fee must be tied to objective measures to the maximum extent appropriate. Performance incentive fee is preferable to performance award fee because it uses objective performance requirements rather than subjective performance requirements. Performance fee that is award fee may be used when: objective measures are not feasible (that is, when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule); and the likelihood of meeting acquisition objectives will be enhanced by using incentives that effectively motivate the contactor toward exceptional performance and provide the Government with the flexibility to evaluate both actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved.

        (8) Within the maximum total available fee, Contracting Officer may include a type of incentive fee component, often labeled “performance based incentive (PBI),” that includes a target fee for a target level of performance. Each PBI must be tied to a specific portion of the total available fee pool. PBIs may only be used when—

        (i) A target level of performance can be established that the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach;

        (ii) Factors likely to impede the target performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and

        (iii) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable.

        (c)  (1) Determining the maximum total available fee for each one-year period of the contract is a function of the:

        (i) Magnitude of the effort (reflected by the total fee base for the year; see 970.1504-105);

        (ii) Type of the effort (reflected by the allocation of the total fee base to the three fee schedules—production, research and development, and environmental restoration; see 970.1504-106);

        (iii) Nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work (reflected by the choice of classification factors; see 970.1504-107); and

        (iv) Specific circumstances of the procurement (reflected by the appropriate percentages derived from considering significant factors; see 970.1504-108).

        (2) Calculating the maximum total available fee for a one-year period entails determining the total fee base for the year, allocating it to the fee schedules based on the type of effort, using the fee schedules to determine a fee subtotal for each type of effort, multiplying those fee subtotals by classification factors, multiplying the resulting products by appropriate percentages, and summing those products. (See 970.1504-104 for a complete explanation and an example.)

        (d)  (1) In addition to other performance requirements specified in their contracts, M&O contractors are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&H), including worker safety and health (WS&H) and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&H will be set forth in the contract's ES&H terms and conditions, including a DOE-approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. Performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract at 952.204-2, “Security Requirements,” and 970.5204-2, “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. (If the contract does not include the clause at 952.204-2, “Security Requirements,” the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information requirements of the clause at 970.5215-3, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” do not apply.)

        (2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 970.5215-3, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts.”

        (3) The clause at 970.5215-3, entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&H requirements, and relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.

        (4) The Contracting Officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer—

        (i) Prior to effecting any reduction; and

        (ii) Prior to determining that a reduction is not warranted for a particular performance failure or a group of performance failures.

        (5) The Contracting Officer must coordinate with the Office of Enforcement within the Office of Enterprise Assessments (or with any designated successor office) before pursuing a contract fee reduction in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any DOE regulation relating to worker safety and health concerns. See 970.2303-2.

        (e)  (1) Contracts that are a combination of types or include work elements with fee arrangements that are a combination of contract types must—

        (i) Conform to the requirements of parts 915 and 916 and FAR parts 15 and 16; and

        (ii) Where appropriate to the type, be supported by:

        (A) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the 41 U.S.C. chapter 35;

        (B) A pre-negotiation memorandum; and

        (C) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement will be administered.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (f)  Operations and field offices shall take the lead in establishing the most appropriate contract type for their requirements. Before establishing contract types and fee arrangements, operations and field offices must ensure the necessary resources exist within the contractor's and the Government's organizations to administer them.

        970.1504-104   Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period.

#### § 970.1504-104

        (a) The maximum total available fee amount for a contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts of the contract's one-year periods. The maximum total available fee amount in a one-year period is based on the fee base of the one-year period. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period requires considering the: magnitude of the effort (reflected by the total fee base for the year); type of effort (reflected by the allocation of the total fee base to the three fee schedules); nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work (reflected by the choice of classification factors); and specific circumstances of the procurement (reflected by the appropriate percentages derived from considering significant factors).

        (b) To calculate the maximum total available fee amount for a year, the Contracting Officer takes the following steps:

        (1)  Determines the total fee base for the year (see 970.1504-105);

        (2)  Allocates the total fee base for the year as appropriate to the three types of efforts reflected by the three fee schedules (if there is only one type of effort, all of the total fee base is allocated to the fee schedule appropriate for the effort);

        (3)  Using the portion of the total fee base allocated to the schedule in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (step 2), determines a fee subtotal for each type of effort (see 970.1504-106);

        (4)  Multiplies each of the fee subtotals in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (step 3) by the appropriate classification factor (see 970.1504-107);

        (5)  Multiplies each of the products produced in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (step 4) by the appropriate percentage, which is determined by considering the significant factors (see 970.1504-108); and

        (6)  Adds the products of paragraph (b)(5) of this section (step 5).

        (c) An example of calculating the maximum total available fee for a one-year period follows in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section. The assumptions are: total fee base is 50,000,000 (comprising 10,000,000 of Production efforts, 15,000,000 of Research and Development (R&D) efforts, and 25,000,000 of Environmental Management (EM) efforts), classification factors are 3.0, 1.5, and 2.0, and appropriate percentages are 90%, 85%, and 75%.

        (1)  Determination of the total fee base: 50,000,000.

        (2)  Allocation of the total fee base in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (step 1) to the three fee schedules (based on the types of effort in the total fee base):

        (i) 10,000,000 to Production;

        (ii) 15,000,000 to R&D; and

        (iii) 25,000,000 to EM.

        (3)  Determination of the fee subtotal for each type of effort using the applicable fee schedules:

        (i) 578,726 for Production;

        (ii) 957,250 for R&D; and

        (iii) 1,236,340 for EM.

        (4)  Multiplication of the fee subtotal in paragraph (c)(3) of this section (step 3) for each type of effort by the appropriate classification factor:

        (i) 578,726 × 3.0 = 1,736,178 for Production;

        (ii) 957,250 × 1.5 = 1,435,875 for R&D; and

        (iii) 1,236,340 × 2.0 = 2,472,680 for EM.

        (5)  Multiplication of each of the products of paragraph (c)(4) of this section (step 4) by the appropriate percentage for the type of work (determined by considering the significant factors (see 970.1504-108)):

        (i) 1,736,178 × .9 = 1,562,560 for Production;

        (ii) 1,435,875 × .85 = 1,220,494 for R&D; and

        (iii) 2,472,680 × .75 = 1,854,510 for EM.

        (6)  Addition of the products of paragraph (c)(5) of this section (step 5):

        (i) 1,562,560.

        (ii) 1,220,494.

        (iii) 1,854,510.

        (iv) 4,637,564.

        (d) In summary, the maximum total available fee amount for a contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts of the contract's one-year periods. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period entails determining the total fee base, allocating it to the fee schedules, using the fee schedules to determine fee subtotals, multiplying the fee subtotals by classification factors, multiplying the resulting products by appropriate percentages, and summing those products. (Allocating the amount of maximum total available fee for a one-year period to an evaluation period or periods is a separate action.)

        970.1504-105   Fee base.

#### § 970.1504-105

        (a) The total fee base for a one-year period (see step 1 located at 970.1504-104(b)(1)) is an estimate of the allowable costs for the one-year period, with some exclusions. (Estimates for Strategic Partnership Projects may be included in the total fee base, where appropriate.) The total fee base excludes estimates of allowable costs for: source and special nuclear materials; land, buildings, and facilities (whether they are to be leased, purchased or constructed); depreciation of Government facilities; and efforts for which a separate fee is to be negotiated.

        (b) In addition to the exclusions in paragraph (a) of the section, the total fee base excludes:

        (1) Any part of the estimated allowable cost of capital equipment that the contractor procures by subcontract and other similar costs that are of such magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort required of the contractor;

        (2) At least 20% of the estimated allowable cost of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements, with the excluded amount increasing as the contractor's estimated required management effort decreases;

        (3) Estimates of allowable home office or corporate general and administrative expenses that will be reimbursed;

        (4) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the contractor;

        (5) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and

        (6) State taxes.

        (c) The total fee base does not reflect any fee or compensation for unusual architect-engineer or construction services provided by the M&O contractor. Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. The fees for such services shall be calculated per 915.404-4800 and added to the fees calculated using the production, R&D, and EM schedules. The total fee base also does not reflect any fee or compensation for special equipment purchases. The fees for special equipment purchases shall be calculated per 915.404-4800 and added to the fees calculated using the production, R&D, and EM schedules.

        (d) No fee schedule may be used more than once in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period.

        970.1504-106   Fee schedules.

#### § 970.1504-106

        (a) In calculating the amount of maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period (see 970.1504-104), once the total fee base for the year is determined it is allocated to one or more of the three fee schedules based upon the type of effort. The three types of efforts are: Production; R&D; and EM. Each fee schedule provides a fee subtotal (see steps 2 and 3 in 970.1504-104(b)(2) and (3)).

        (b) The three schedules are:

        970.1504-107   Classification factors.

#### § 970.1504-107

        (a) There are five classification factors. They are tied to facility/task categories. Step 4 in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for the one-year period (see 970.1504-104(b)(4)) is to multiply the fee subtotal in step 3 for each type of effort by the appropriate classification factor. The classification factors and their corresponding facility/task categories are:

        (b) The Contracting Officer shall select the Facility/Task Category after considering the following:

        (1)  The main focus of effort performed is related to—

        (i) The manufacture, assembly, retrieval, disassembly, or disposal of nuclear weapons with explosive potential;

        (ii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals with consideration given to the degree the nature of the work advances state-of-the-art technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is significantly demanding when compared to similar industrial/DOE settings ( nuclear energy processing, industrial environmental cleanup);

        (iii) Construction of facilities such as nuclear reactors, atomic particle accelerators, or complex laboratories or industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials;

        (iv) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or

        (v) As designated by the SPE, or designee. (Classification factor 3.0)

        (2)  The main focus of effort performed is related to—

        (i) The safeguarding and maintenance of nuclear weapons or nuclear material;

        (ii) The manufacture or assembly of nuclear components;

        (iii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals or other substances that pose a significant threat to the environment or the health and safety of workers or the public, if the nature of the work uses state-of-the-art technologies or applications in such operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is more demanding than that found in similar industrial/DOE settings ( nuclear energy, chemical or petroleum processing, industrial environmental cleanup);

        (iv) The detailed planning necessary for the assembly/disassembly of nuclear weapons/components;

        (v) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring a high degree of design layout or process control;

        (vi) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or

        (vii) As designated by the SPE or designee. (Classification factor 2.5)

        (3)  The main focus of effort performed is related to—

        (i) The physical cleanup, processing, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals if the nature of the work uses routine technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is similar to that found in similar industrial/DOE settings ( nuclear energy, chemical processing, industrial environmental cleanup);

        (ii) Plant and facility maintenance;

        (iii) Plant and facility security (other than the safeguarding of nuclear weapons and material);

        (iv) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring normal processes and operations; general or administrative service buildings; or routine infrastructure requirements;

        (v) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or

        (vi) As designated by the SPE or designee. (Classification factor 2.0)

        (4)  The main focus of the effort performed is R&D conducted at a DOE laboratory. (Classification factor 1.5)

        (5)  Efforts performed using a fixed fee. (Classification factor 1.0)

        (c) Where the SPE or designee has approved a base fee, the Classification Factors shall be reduced, as approved by the SPE or designee.

        (d) Any risks that are indemnified by the Government (for example, risks under the Price-Anderson Act) will not be considered as risks to the contractor.

        970.1504-108   Determining the appropriate percentage by considering the significant factors.

#### § 970.1504-108

        (a) In calculating the maximum total available fee for a one-year period (see 970.1504-104), step 5 (970.1504-104(b)(5)) is to consider the specific circumstances of the procurement using the following significant factors for each type of effort, determine the appropriate percentage for the type of work, and apply it to the subtotals of fee from step 4 (970.1504-104(b)(4)). An appropriate percentage of 100% would be applied to work of maximum difficulty and/or complexity; lesser percentages would be applied to work less difficult or complex. The significant factors are:

        (1) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience;

        (2) Management risk relating to performance, including—

        (i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required to do the job; and

        (ii) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;

        (3) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing operations, etc.);

        (4) The nature and relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, subcontractor management, and complexity of integration with other contractors;

        (5) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small and minority business subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.; and

        (6) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract.

        (b) [Reserved]

        Usually, the length of an evaluation period is one year, mirroring the one-year period used in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period. The SPE's or designee's approval is required to do otherwise. Nonetheless, the Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. Consequently, there may be occasions where after calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period, part or all of it should be allocated to a subsequent one-year evaluation period, an evaluation period of greater than a year, or to several evaluation periods.

        970.1706   Management and operating contracts.

#### § 970.1706

        970.1706-1   Award, renewal, and extension.

#### § 970.1706-1

        (a)  Effective performance under an M&O contract is facilitated by the use of a relatively long contract term. Only the Secretary can authorize the use of an M&O contract and only the Secretary can renew the original authorization of an M&O contract.

        (1) An M&O contract shall—after the Secretary has authorized its original use (either by a competitive award or by a sole source award), its maximum term, and any other limits on its terms (options or other terms)—provide for a base term not to exceed the lesser of five years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized.

        (2) The contract may include option terms provided no option term exceeds the lesser of five years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized (for options or the contract) and the sum of base term and the option terms does not exceed the lesser of 10 years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized for the contract. In addition to the base term and the option terms just described, an M&O contract for a national laboratory that is competitively awarded may provide for award term incentives provided none exceed the maximum term the Secretary authorized for each. The sum of base term, option terms, and award terms shall not exceed the lesser of 20 years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized for the contract.

        (3) After the Secretary's original authorization of the use of the M&O contract has expired, any continuation of work under an M&O contract must be preceded by the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&O contract. Whether work is to be continued by a competitive award to a new contractor or to the incumbent, by a sole source award to a new contractor, or by a sole source extension of the contract to the incumbent, the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&O contract to perform the work is required before work may continue.

        (4) In addition to requiring the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&O contract, a sole source extension of an M&O contract to the incumbent must be justified under one of the statutory authorities listed in FAR 6.302 and authorized by the Secretary.

        (5) The specific duration of the base term, option terms, and award terms of an M&O contract must be established concurrent with the Secretary's authorization (or renewal of his/her authorization) to use an M&O contract (for original use, sole source award to a new contractor, competitive award to a new contractor or to the incumbent, or sole source extension of the contract to the incumbent).

        (b)  The contracting officer's decision to exercise an option (if the Secretary's authorization to use an M&O contract covers the option period) must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). In deciding to exercise the option, the contracting officer shall:

        (1) Consider the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present or can be negotiated into the contract.

        (2) Make the determinations required by FAR 17.605 in the manner described therein. As part of the review required by FAR 17.605(b), the Contracting Officer shall assess whether competing the contract will produce a more advantageous offer than exercising the option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract, the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present, or can be negotiated into the contract, and the impact of a change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are considerations that shall be addressed in the Contracting Officer's decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's best interest. The Contracting Officer's decision shall be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). The determinations described in FAR 17.207(d) and (e)(2) are not required, and because of the way in which the evaluation of cost to the Government is performed in the award of an M&O contract that includes options, the Contracting Officer need only determine the option was evaluated as part of the initial competition and contains a maximum fee. The Contracting Officer need not, for example: issue a new solicitation; informally analyze prices; or determine the option is the more advantageous offer.

        (c)  Authorization to extend a management and operating contract by the Head of the Agency shall be considered conditional upon the successful negotiation of the contract to be extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall advise the Senior Procurement Executive no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization as to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the contracting activity's plans for competing the requirement.

> [89 FR 89783, Nov. 13, 2024]

        970.2201-120   Policies.

#### § 970.2201-120

        (a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of absolute authority on all questions of security in accordance with 10 CFR 706.40; and DOE review of labor expenses under management and operating (M&O) contracts (and certain other contracts) to assure judicious expenditure of public funds. It is the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based:

        (1)  (i) M&O contractors (and certain other non-M&O contractors and subcontractors as described in 970.2201-110) are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private operations to staff key positions on the contract and to recruit other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Contractors are required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives as required by, among other things, the clause at FAR 52.222-26.

        (ii) When the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, is applicable (see 904.404), the Contracting Officer will obtain adequate assurance that the Contractor performed the required review of an uncleared applicant's or of an uncleared employee's background in its determination to select an individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.

        (2)  In accordance with 10 CFR 706.40, on all matters of security at its facilities, DOE retains absolute authority. Neither the regulations or policies pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for collective bargaining between the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process.

        (3)  The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement between contractor management and employee representatives with maximum possible freedom from Government interference and consistent with paragraph (a)(5) of this section and 970.2201-140.

        (4)  The handling of employee relations on contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the normal management responsibility of the contractor.

        (5)  (i) DOE review of collective bargaining practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt practices (which experience has shown) that are fundamental to the equitable resolution of disputes and promote orderly collective bargaining relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted.

        (ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal operations. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(ii), each collective bargaining agreement entered into during the period of performance of this contract should provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.

        (iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

        (6)  DOE encourages and supports personnel training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable.

        (7)  Accident, fire, health, and occupational hazards associated with DOE activities should be held to a practical minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, to the extent set forth in the terms and conditions of the contract, contractors are required to:

        (i) Maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout all operations.

        (ii) Provide appropriate financial protection in case of occupational disability to employees.

        (b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts (see 970.0407-120) for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be disposed of in accordance with the clause at 970.5232-3, Accounts, Records, and Inspection, and other DOE directions. For such contracts, the Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement for the retention of payrolls and associated records for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives.

        970.2201-140   Wages, salaries, and employee benefits.

#### § 970.2201-140

        (a) It is DOE policy that contractors facilitate the retention of certain critically skilled employees for: the management and operation of laboratories and other national defense and security site facilities; contracts designated by the Senior Procurement Executive; and certain other non-M&O contracts as described in 970.2201-100. Critically skilled employees are those employees whose specific recognized technical skills, knowledge, and experience in a specific field are critical to the operations or strategy of a contractor, and whose loss from the DOE contractor's workforce system would cause a significant negative impact on achieving and supporting national research, environmental, defense, and security objectives.

        (b) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits shall be administered in a manner designated to adapt the normal practices and conditions of industry or institutions of higher education to the contract work, and to provide for appropriate review by DOE.

        (c) The contractor's compensation systems and supporting policies should support the effective recruitment and retention of a highly skilled, motivated, and experienced workforce at a reasonable cost. For a cost to be allowable it must comply with each of the five requirements for allowability stated in FAR 31.201-2. Some of the specific details of the allowable costs for compensation for personal services are discussed at FAR 31.205-6, as supplemented by, 970.3102-506, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR and DOE directives and policies.

        970.2270   Unemployment compensation.

#### § 970.2270

        (a) Each state has its own unemployment compensation system to provide payments to workers who become unemployed involuntarily and through no fault of their own. These claims are payable by employers through the state unemployment insurance tax. Some entities such as nonprofits may be permitted to either pay in or opt out. These claims are payable either through the state unemployment insurance tax (pay in) or by reimbursing the state for actual claims paid out to former employees (opt out).

        (b) The predictability of paying claims through the state unemployment insurance tax is preferred and highly encouraged. However, an M&O contractor may choose to opt out. A contractor before deciding to opt out, generally performs an analysis of its workforce including size and stability of the workforce, historical turnover rate and historical payout data. This information may also be provided to state regulators who are interested in ensuring that employers who opt out establish an adequate reserve fund to reimburse the state for the claims that are processed for the company's former employees.

        (c) When an M&O contractor opts out of paying for claims through the state's unemployment insurance tax, as permitted and in accordance with state laws, regulations and guidelines, the reimbursement by DOE, in any given year, should generally be limited to the actual incurred cost, but no more than what would have been incurred had the contractor chosen to pay in.

        (b) The inclusion of environmental, safety and health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer in accordance with this subpart and in consultation with appropriate environmental, safety and health program management personnel.

        (c)(1) For DOE management and operating contracts and other contracts designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the clause entitled “970.5215-3 Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts” implements the requirements of section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act for the use of a contract clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fee or amount paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns. The clause, in part, provides for reductions in the amount of fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by the contractor for performance failures relating to worker safety and health violations under the Department's regulations.

        (2)(i) Section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act states that DOE shall either pursue civil penalties (implemented at 10 CFR part 851) for a violation under section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2282c) or a contract fee reduction, but not both.

        (ii) The contracting officer must coordinate with the Office of Enforcement within the Office of Enterprise Assessments (or with any designated successor office) before pursuing contract fee reduction in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns.

        (a) When work under management and operating contracts and subcontracts thereunder is to be performed at a facility where DOE will exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety and Health into Work Planning and Execution, shall be used in such contract or subcontract and made applicable to the work if conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, are satisfied—

        (1) DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's other work;

        (2) The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety and health services; and

        970.2703   Patent rights.

#### § 970.2703

        970.2703-1   Purposes of patent rights clauses.

#### § 970.2703-1

        (a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts.

        (b) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&O contract. It may be appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The final award must contain only one patent rights clause.

        970.2703-2   Patent rights clause provisions for management and operating contractors.

#### § 970.2703-2

        (a)  (1) If the M&O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201, the clause at 970.5227-10 must be inserted into the M&O contract, except when the M&O contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. The patent rights clause at 970.5227-10 allows the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of work under the contract in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 200  (the Bayh-Dole Act).

        (2) If the M&O contractor is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify the clause at 970.5227-10 to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.

        (b)  (1) The clause at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&O contract:

        (i) For any the M&O contractor that does not qualify as a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 and for which DOE has not granted a patent waiver pursuant to 10 CFR part 784; or

        (ii) If, without regard to the type of contractor, the M&O contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs.

        (2) The clause at 970.5227-11 requires the contractor to assign the Government title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&O contract in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908 (the Atomic Energy of 1954 and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974).

        (c)  DOE may grant a patent waiver for an M&O contractor that does not qualify as a nonprofit organization or a small business firm pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. The patent waiver would allow the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions made in the course of or under the M&O contract. When a patent waiver is granted that covers the M&O contractor, the clause at 970.5227-12 must be inserted into the M&O contract, instead of using the clause at 970.5227-11. The clause at 970.5227-12 may be modified by applicable patent. If the M&O contractor is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract, DOE may modify the patent rights clause to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.

        (d)  The patent rights clauses for M&O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its rights in inventions. The M&O contractor may request extensions of time in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of between six (6) months to one (1) year.

        (e)  These include the rights to make, use, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license.

        (f)  If DOE determines that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be performed during the course of a management and operating contract most probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause provision entitled, “Classified Inventions” from the M&O contract.

        (g)  If DOE grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is involved in weapons related research and development, or production, then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the M&O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions.

        (h)  When the M&O contractor is issuing a subcontract to a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201, the subcontractor retains all rights provided in the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.3(a) and 401.14 and adding Alternate I of 48 CFR 952.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor, that includes the agency implementing regulations specific for DOE. If the S&E DEC, or any other related DEC to substantial U.S. manufacturing policy, is applicable, the Contractor shall include Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor. Alternate II modifies 37 CFR 401.14 to:

        (1) Reflect DOE required subcontracting instructions pursuant to 37 CFR 401.5(a) as well as the deletion of the definition of contractor that does not apply based on the subcontracting instructions; and

        (2) Include the U.S. competitiveness provision pursuant to the Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies executed by DOE on June 7, 2021.

#### § 970.2704-1

        (a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711  as amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, shall be used.

        (b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services which are similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed.

        970.2704-2   Procedures.

#### § 970.2704-2

        (a) The clauses at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, both provide generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the Government for all data first produced in the performance of the contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained therein. For Research and Development Contracting, requirements for R&D results conveyed in scientific and technical information are addressed in 935.010 and should be set forth as part of the contract. These contractual requirements are further addressed in DOE Order 241.1B, or its successor version, which sets forth requirements for scientific and technical information.

        (b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract.

        (c)(1) Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data—Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.

        (2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 927.404-71, which provides statutory authority to protect from public disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying guidance.

        (3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel.

        (d)(1) Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the contract.

        (2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer.

        (e) The Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's taking a limited copyright license during the period in which the copyrighted data is being commercialized. The contractor must notify DOE (Patent Counsel and Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI)) when commercial activity ceases.

        (f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2.

        (g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the performance of a contract.

        970.2704-3   Contract clauses.

#### § 970.2704-3

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in management and operating contracts which do not contain the clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. The Contracting Officer may insert, with concurrence of Patent Counsel, the clause at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in other contracts where Government facilities are being constructed, modified, or in decontamination and decommissioning. The contracting officer shall include the clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors. The Contracting Officer shall include the clause with its Alternate II in contracts where Government facilities are being constructed, modified, or in decontamination and decommissioning, and it is anticipated that further solicitation may be required to complete the project.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, in management and operating contracts which contain the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission. The contracting officer shall include the clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors. The Contracting Officer shall include the clause with its Alternate II in contracts where Government facilities are being constructed, modified, or in decontamination and decommissioning, and it is anticipated that further solicitation may be required to complete the project.

        970.2770   Technology Transfer.

#### § 970.2770

        970.2770-1   General.

#### § 970.2770-1

        This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711  as amended). The Act requires that technology transfer be established as a mission of each Government-owned laboratory operated under contract by a non-Federal entity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 expanded the definition of “laboratory” to include weapon production facilities that are operated for national security purposes and are engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components.

        970.2770-2   Policy.

#### § 970.2770-2

        All new awards for or extensions of existing DOE laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contracts shall have technology transfer, including authorization to award Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), as a laboratory or facility mission under Section 11(a)(1) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-480 (15 U.S.C. 3701  as amended). All new awards for or extensions of existing DOE laboratory or weapon production facility M&O contracts shall include authorization for the M&O contractor to engage directly with third parties in Agreements for Commercializing Technology, under section 107 of the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, Public Law 115-246, by using 970.5217-2, Agreements for Commercializing Technology.  A management and operating contractor for a facility not deemed to be a laboratory or weapon production facility may be authorized on a case-by-case basis to support the DOE technology transfer mission including, but not limited to, participating in CRADAs awarded by DOE laboratories and weapon production facilities.

        970.2770-3   Technology transfer and patent rights.

#### § 970.2770-3

        The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (NCTTA) established technology transfer as a mission for Government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories, including weapons production facilities, and authorizes those laboratories to negotiate and award cooperative research and development agreements with public and private entities for purposes of conducting research and development and transferring technology to the private sector. In implementing the NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause required by this subpart. Thus, each management and operating contractor holds title to subject inventions for the benefit of the laboratory or facility being managed and operated by that contractor.

        970.2770-4   Contract clause.

#### § 970.2770-4

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission, in each solicitation for a new or an extension of an existing laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contract.

        (b) If the contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business eligible under 35 U.S.C. 200  to receive title to any inventions under the contract and proposes to fund at private expense the maintaining, licensing, and marketing of the inventions, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate I.

        (c) If the facility is operated for national security purposes and engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate II.

      Subpart 970.28—Bonds and Insurance

        970.2803   Insurance.

#### § 970.2803

        970.2803-1   Workers' compensation insurance.

#### § 970.2803-1

        (a)  (1) Workers' compensation insurance protects employers against liability imposed by workers' compensation laws for injury or death to employees arising out of, or in the course of, their employment. This type of insurance is required by state laws unless employers have acceptable programs of self-insurance.

        (2)  Certain workers' compensation laws contain provisions which result in limiting the protection afforded persons subject to such laws. The policy with respect to these limitations as they affect persons employed by management and operating contractors is set forth as follows:

        (i)  Some worker's compensation laws permit an employer to elect not to be subject to its provisions. It is DOE policy to require these contractors to be subject to workers' compensation laws in jurisdictions permitting election.

        (ii)  Under the provisions of some workers' compensation laws, certain types of employers; e.g., nonprofit educational institutions, are relieved from liability. If a contractor has a statutory option to accept liability, it is DOE policy to require the contractor to do so.

        (iii)  Some workers' compensation laws limit the liability of the employer for medical care to a maximum dollar amount or to a specified period of time. In such cases, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain a standard extra-statutory medical coverage endorsement.

        (iv)  Some workers' compensation laws do not provide coverage for all occupational diseases. In such situations, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain voluntary coverage for all occupational diseases.

        (3) — The policies and requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply where management and operating contractors purchase workers' compensation insurance. With respect to self-insured contractors, the objectives specified in paragraph (a)(2) also shall be met through primary or excess workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance policy(ies) or an approved combination thereof. “Employees” benefit plans” which were established in prior years may be continued to contrast termination at existing benefit levels.

        (b)  (1) Office of Acquisition Management, other officials, and the Heads of Contracting Activities, consistent with their delegations of responsibility, shall assure management and operating contracts are consistent with the policies and requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) In discharging assigned responsibility, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall—

        (i) Periodically review workers' compensation insurance programs of management and operating contractors in the light of applicable workers' compensation statutes to assure conformance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;

        (ii) Evaluate the adequacy of coverage of “self-insured” workers” compensation programs; and

        (iii) Provide arrangements for the administration of any existing “employees” benefit plans until such plans” are terminated.

        (3) Heads of Contracting Activities are responsible for approving management and operating contractor “employees' benefit plans.”

        (a) Take all necessary steps to preclude payment of any taxes for which any of the immunities or exemptions cited in this subpart are available. Advice of Counsel should be sought as to the availability of such immunities or exemptions; and

        (b) Acquire directly and furnish to contractors as Government furnished property, equipment, material, or services when, in the opinion of the Head of the Contracting Activity—

        (1) Such direct acquisition will result in substantial savings to the Government, taking into consideration any additional administrative costs;

        (2) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse effect on the relationship between DOE and its contractor; and

        (3) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse effect on the DOE program or schedules.

        970.3102-370   Home office expenses.

#### § 970.3102-370

        (a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the procedures in 970.1504-103, generally provides adequate compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business as a whole.

        (1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. The difficulty arises because:

        (i) The general construct of a management and operating contract results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and

        (ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, property, and other needed resources.

        (2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues.

        (3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional compensation. The contractor may request—

        (i) Fee in addition to its normal fee; or

        (ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost.

        (4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract.

        (b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses.

        970.3102-506   Compensation for personal services.

#### § 970.3102-506

        (a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE cost-type contracts.

        (7)(i) Reimbursable costs for compensation for personal services are to be set forth in the contract. This compensation shall be set forth using the principles and policies of FAR 31.205-6, Compensation for personal services, as supplemented by this section, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR. Costs that are unallowable under other contract terms shall not be allowable as compensation for personnel services.

        (ii) The contract sets forth, in detail, personnel costs and related expenses allowable under the contract and documents personnel policies, practices and plans which have been found acceptable by the contracting officer. The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual rate as specified in the contract. Allowable costs of employee compensation shall be determined pursuant to FAR 31.205-6(p).

        970.3102-546   Travel costs.

#### § 970.3102-546

        (a)  (1) Costs incurred by contractor personnel on official company business are allowable, subject to the limitations contained in this subsection. Costs for transportation may be based on mileage rates, actual costs incurred, or on a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge. Costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses may be based on per diem, actual expenses, or a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (as defined in the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this subsection) shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the—

        (i) Federal Travel Regulation, prescribed by the General Services Administration (41 CFR chapters 300 through 304), for travel in the conterminous 48 United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 922-002-00000-2;

        (ii) Joint Travel Regulations, DoD Civilian Personnel, Appendix A, prescribed by the Department of Defense, for travel in Alaska, Hawaii, The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 908-010-00000-1; or

        (iii) Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), section 925, “Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas,” prescribed by the Department of State, for travel in areas not covered in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 744-008-00000-0.

        (3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as permitted in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection. For such higher amounts to be allowable, all of the following conditions must be met:

        (i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense method, as set forth in the regulations referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, must exist.

        (ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be approved by an officer of the contractor's organization or designee to ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to prevent abuse.

        (iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the contracting officer.

        (iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in accordance with the contractor's established practices, subject to paragraph (a)(7) of this subsection, and provided that a receipt is required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more. The approved justification required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and, if applicable, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this subsection must be retained.

        (4) Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection do not incorporate the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this subsection in their entirety. Only the maximum per diem rates, the definitions of lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and the regulatory coverage dealing with special or unusual situations are incorporated in this subsection.

        (5) An advance agreement (see 48 CFR 31.109 and 970.3101-9) with respect to compliance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection may be useful and desirable.

        (6)(i) The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection generally would not constitute a reasonable daily charge—

        (A) When no lodging costs are incurred; and/or

        (B) On partial travel days (e.g., day of departure and return).

        (ii) Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge.

        (7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is documented:

        (i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the expenses;

        (ii) Purpose of the trip; and

        (iii) Name of person on trip and that person's title or relationship to the contractor.

        (b) Travel costs incurred in the normal course of overall administration of the business are allowable and shall be treated as indirect costs.

        (c) Travel costs directly attributable to specific contract performance are allowable and may be charged to the contract under 48 CFR 31.202.

        (d) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, or equivalent airfare offered during normal business hours are unallowable except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, in order for airfare costs in excess of the standard airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) must be documented and justified.

        (e)(1) “Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft,” as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs.

        (2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate—

        (i) Date, time, and points of departure;

        (ii) Destination, date, and time of arrival;

        (iii) Name of each passenger and relationship to the contractor;

        (iv) Authorization for trip; and

        (v) Purpose of trip.

        (3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see 48 CFR 31.109), consideration may be given to the following:

        (i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently;

        (ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs.

        (f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business. That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services and is unallowable as stated in 48 CFR 31.205-6(m)(2).

        970.4102   Acquiring utility services.

#### § 970.4102

        970.4102-1   Policy.

#### § 970.4102-1

        (a) Utility services defined at 48 CFR 41.101 for the furnishing of electricity, gas (natural or manufactured), steam, water, and/or sewerage to facilities owned or leased by Department of Energy (DOE) shall be acquired directly by DOE and not by a contractor using a subcontractor arrangement, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

        (b) Where it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, a DOE contracting activity may authorize a management and operating contractor for a facility to acquire such utility service for the facility, after requesting and receiving concurrence to make such an authorization from the DOE Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). Any request for such concurrence should be included in the Utility Acquisition Plan. Alternatively, it may be made in a separate document submitted to the FEMP Utility Program Manager early in the acquisition cycle. Any request shall set forth why it is in the best interest of the DOE to acquire utility service(s) by subcontract,  low performance risk and cost risk. For NNSA programs, FEMP review and technical input may be obtained, but FEMP concurrence is not necessary.

        (c) The requirements of FAR part 41 and this section shall be applied to a subcontract level acquisition for furnishing utility services to a facility owned or leased by DOE.

      Subpart 970.42—Contract Administration

        970.4207-302   Certificate of costs.

#### § 970.4207-302

        (a) The contracting officer shall require that management and operating contractors provide a submission, pursuant to 970.5232-2-(j), for settlement of costs incurred during the period stipulated on the submission and a certification that the costs included in the submission are allowable. The contracting officer shall assess a penalty pursuant to 970.5242-1 if unallowable costs are included in the submission. Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or determined unallowable.

        (1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable.

        (2) A cost determined unallowable is one which, for that contractor—

        (i) Was subject to a contracting officer's final decision and not appealed;

        (ii) The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or a court has previously ruled as unallowable; or

        (iii) Was mutually agreed to be unallowable.

        (b) If, during the review of the submission, the contracting officer determines that the submission contains an expressly unallowable cost or a cost determined to be unallowable prior to the submission, the contracting officer shall assess a penalty.

        (c) If the contracting officer determines that a cost submitted by the contractor in its submission for settlement is:

        (1) Expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to the contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97).

        (2) Determined unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to the contract.

        (d) The contracting officer may waive the penalty provisions when:

        (1) The contractor withdraws the submission before the formal initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised submission;

        (2) The amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered contracts is $10,000 or less; or

        (3) The contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer's satisfaction that:

        (i) It has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and an internal control and review system that provides assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and

        (ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the submission.

        (e) The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive the certification when—

        (1) It determines that it would be in the best interest of the United States to waive such certification; and

        (2) It states in writing the reasons for that determination and makes such determination available to the public.

        (ii) The opinion of the Department of Energy's auditor on the allowability of such costs if such costs have been the subject of a DOE audit.

        (5) The contracting officer shall ensure that the documentation supporting the final settlement addresses the amount of the questioned costs and the subsequent disposition of such questioned costs.

        (6) The contracting officer shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the Department of Energy's auditor is afforded an opportunity to attend any negotiation or meeting with the contractor regarding a determination of allowability.

        970.4400   Scope.

#### § 970.4400

        This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the purchasing systems and activities of management and operating contractors.

        970.4401   Responsibilities.

#### § 970.4401

        970.4401-1   General.

#### § 970.4401-1

        (a) In the Department of Energy (DOE), overall responsibility for the oversight of the performance of management and operating contractors, including their purchasing activities, rests with the cognizant DOE contracting activity and, in particular, the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). Contracting officers are responsible for the management and operating contractors' conformance with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts, and for determining whether those purchasing activities provide timely and effective support to DOE programs.

        (b) In carrying out their overall responsibilities, HCAs shall—

        (1) Require management and operating contractors to maintain written descriptions of their individual purchasing systems and methods and further require that, upon award or extension of the contract, the entire written description be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance;

        (2) Require that any changes to the management and operating contractor's written description having any substantive impact upon the contractor's purchasing system and methods be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance prior to issuance;

        (3) Ensure the review of individual purchasing actions of certain types, or above stated dollar levels, by the contracting officer pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 44.2 or as set forth in the contractor's approved system and methods; and

        (4) Ensure that periodic appraisals of the contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including compliance with the contractor's approved system and methods, are performed by the contracting officer.

        (c) In performing the reviews required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2), and the appraisals required by paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, HCAs shall assure that contracting officers determine that the contractors' written systems and methods are consistent with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts.

        970.4401-2   Review and approval.

#### § 970.4401-2

        (a) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall establish thresholds, by subcontract type and dollar level, for the review and approval of proposed subcontracting actions by each management and operating contractor under their cognizance. Such thresholds may not exceed the authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following—

        (1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and operating contract;

        (2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function;

        (3) The internal controls, procedures, and organizational stature of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function; and

        (4) Policies with respect to such reviews and approvals established by the Senior Procurement Executive.

        (b) Prior approval shall be required for the subcontracting of any work a contractor is obligated to perform under a contract entered into under section 41, entitled Production of Special Nuclear Material, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

        (c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract may require DOE approval.

        (d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive.

        (e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract.

        (f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all purchasing transactions.

        (g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the purchase.

        (h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments.

        970.4401-3   Advance notification.

#### § 970.4401-3

        (a) Contracting officers shall assure that the written description of the management and operating contractor's purchasing system and methods provides for advance notice to the DOE contracting officer of the proposed award of the following specified types of subcontracts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection—

        (1) Pursuant to section 304(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Service Act of 1949, as amended (41 U.S.C. 254(b)):

        (i) Cost reimbursement-type subcontracts of any award value; and

        (ii) Fixed price-type subcontracts which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract.

        (2) Purchases from contractor-affiliated sources over a value established by the HCA.

        (b) Pursuant to section 602(d)13 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 474(13)) referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the advance notification requirement for the types of purchases listed in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply to subcontracts relating to functions derived from the Atomic Energy Commission.

        (c) The advance notice shall contain, at a minimum, a description of work, estimated cost, type of contract or reimbursement provisions, and extent of competition, or justification for a noncompetitive purchase procurement. The contracting officer may at any time request additional information that must be furnished promptly and prior to award of the subcontract.

        970.4402   Contractor purchasing system.

#### § 970.4402

        970.4402-1   Policy.

#### § 970.4402-1

        (a) DOE contracts for the management and operation of its facilities, the design and production of nuclear weapons, energy research and development, and the performance of other services. These management and operating (M&O) contractors have been selected for their technical and managerial expertise and are expected to bring to bear these technical and managerial skills to accomplish the significant Federal mission(s) described in their contracts with, and work plans approved by, DOE.

        (b) Purchasing done by management and operating contractors is one area in which the particular skills of the contractors will be brought to bear in order to more readily accomplish the contractors' assigned missions. The contracting procedures of the contractor's organization, therefore, form the basis for the development of a purchasing system and methods that will comply with its contract with DOE and this subpart.

        (c) The M&O contractor's purchasing performance, including compliance with the contractor's approved system and methods, will be evaluated against the performance criteria and measures set forth in FAR subpart 44.3, using the procedures articulated in DOE policies including DOE guidance on oversight of M&O Contractors' Purchasing Systems.

> [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 89789, Nov. 13, 2024]

        970.4402-2   General requirements.

#### § 970.4402-2

        The following shall apply to the purchasing systems of management and operating contractors:

        (a) The objective of a management and operating contractor's purchasing system is to deliver to its customers on a timely basis those best value products and services necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government's contract. To achieve this objective, contractors are expected to use their experience, expertise and initiative consistent with this subpart.

        (b) The purchasing systems and methods used by management and operating contractors shall be well-defined, consistently applied, and shall follow purchasing practices appropriate for the requirement and dollar value of the purchase. It is anticipated that purchasing practices and procedures will vary among contractors and according to the type and kinds of purchases to be made.

        (c) Contractor purchases are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect contractor purchasing, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.

        (d) Contractor purchasing systems shall identify and apply the best in commercial purchasing practices and procedures (although nothing precludes the adoption of Federal procurement practices and procedures) to achieve system objectives. Where specific requirements do not otherwise apply, the contractor purchasing system shall provide for appropriate measures to ensure the—

        (1) Acquisition of quality products and services at fair and reasonable prices;

        (2) Use of capable and reliable subcontractors who either—

        (i) Have track records of successful past performance, or

        (ii) Can demonstrate a current superior ability to perform;

        (3) Minimization of acquisition lead-time and administrative costs of purchasing;

        (4) Use of effective competitive techniques;

        (5) Reduction of performance risks associated with subcontractors, and facilitation of quality relationships which can include techniques such as partnering agreements, ombudsmen, and alternative disputes procedures;

        (6) Use of self-assessment and benchmarking techniques to support continuous improvement in purchasing;

        (7) Maintenance of the highest professional and ethical standards;

        (8) Maintenance of file documentation appropriate to the value of the purchase and which is adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price paid; and

        (9) Maximization of opportunities for small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business concerns to participate in contract performance.

        970.4402-3   Purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources.

#### § 970.4402-3

        (a) A management and operating contractor may purchase from sources affiliated with the contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor or its parent company) in the same manner as from other sources, provided—

        (1) The management and operating contractor's purchasing function is independent of the proposed contractor-affiliated source;

        (2) The same terms and conditions would apply if the purchase were from a third party;

        (3) Award is made in accordance with policies and procedures designed to permit effective competition which have been approved by the contracting officer. (This requirement for competition shall not preclude acquisition of technical services from contractor-affiliated entities where those entities have a special expertise, and the basis therefore is documented.); and

        (4) The award is legally enforceable where the entities are separately incorporated.

        (b) Subcontracts for performance of contract work itself (as distinguished from the purchase of supplies and services needed in connection with the performance of work) require DOE authorization and may involve an adjustment of the contractor's fee, if any. If the management and operating contractor seeks authorization to have some part of the contract work performed by a contractor-affiliated source, and that contractor's performance of that work was a factor in the negotiated fee, DOE approval would normally require—

        (1) That the contractor-affiliated source perform such work without fee or profit; or

        (2) An equitable downward adjustment to the management and operating contractor's fee, if any.

        (c) Determination on cost of money allowance as prescribed at 48 CFR 31.225-10 shall be treated as follows:

        (1) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source results from competition and is in accord with provisions and conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this subsection, the contractor-affiliated source may include cost of money as an allowable element of the costs of its goods or services supplied to the contractor; provided—

        (i) The purchase is based on cost as set forth in 48 CFR 31.205-26(e); and

        (ii) The cost of money amount is computed in accordance with 48 CFR 31.205-10 and related procedures (see 970.30).

        (2) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source is made non-competitively, cost of money shall not be considered an allowable element of the cost of the contractor-affiliated source purchase.

        970.4402-4   Nuclear material transfers.

#### § 970.4402-4

        (a) Management and operating contractors, in preparing subcontracts or other agreements in which monetary payments or credits depend on the quantity and quality of nuclear material, shall be required to assure that each such subcontract or agreement contains a—

        (1) Description of the material to be transferred;

        (2) Provision specifying the method by which the quantities are to be measured and reported;

        (3) Provision specifying the procedures to be used in resolving any differences arising as a result of such measurements;

        (4) Provision for the use of an independent third party as an umpire to settle unresolved differences in the analytical samples; and

        (5) Provision specifying in detail which party shall bear the costs of resolving a difference and what constitutes such costs.

        (b) The provisions providing for resolution of measurement differences must be such that resolution is always accomplished, while at the same time minimizing any advantage one party may have over the other.

However, if authorized by the DOE Headquarters office having responsibility for contractor casualty insurance programs, DOE contractors may be—

        (a) Permitted to furnish financial protection to themselves; or

      Subpart 970.52—Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for Management and Operating Contracts

        970.5200   Scope of subpart.

#### § 970.5200

        This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

        970.5215-1   Total available fee: Base fee amount and performance fee amount.

#### § 970.5215-1

        As prescribed in 970.1504-3(a), insert the following clause.

        (a)  Total available fee, consisting of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (consisting of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both) determined in accordance with the provisions of this clause, is available for payment in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Payments and advances.”

        (b)  For any fee negotiations under this contract, at any time prior to the beginning of the evaluation period the negotiations cover, the Contracting Officer and Contractor shall attempt to reach agreement on: the requirements for the evaluation period including, if appropriate, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives; the total available fee amount of the evaluation period; and the allocation of the total available fee amount. If agreement is reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to reflect the agreement. If agreement is not reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer will, prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, unilaterally determine: the requirements of the evaluation period including, if appropriate, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee amount, and the allocation of the total available fee amount. The Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to reflect the determination.

        (c)  (1) The Department of Energy (DOE) shall, at the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the Contractor's performance of all requirements, and determine the total available fee amount earned. At DOE's discretion, if the contact established specific incentivized requirements and a schedule for their completion and the Contractor completes them during the evaluation period, DOE may evaluate the Contractor's performance upon the requirements' completion. The Contractor agrees the determination of the total available fee amount earned is a unilateral determination made by the Fee Determining Official (FDO). DOE will identify the FDO. The FDO will be the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or another DOE official designated by the Assistant Secretary or equivalent (not delegable).

        (2) If the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period shall not be allocated to future evaluation periods. At the sole discretion of DOE, if the award fee cycle consists of more than one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period may be allocated to future evaluation periods within the same award fee cycle.

        (3) Following each evaluation period, the Contractor [insert may or shall] submit a self-assessment within [insert number] calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct them and avoid their recurrence. The FDO will review the Contractor's self-assessment as part of the evaluation of the Contractor's performance during the period.

        (4) The FDO will evaluate the Contractor's performance in accordance with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) described in paragraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the total available fee amount earned determination and the basis of the determination.

        (d)  To the extent not set forth elsewhere in the contract:

        (1) DOE shall establish a PEMP upon which the determination of the total available fee amount earned shall be based. The PEMP will address all of the requirements of contract performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. The Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with a copy of the PEMP before the start of an evaluation period.

        (2) The PEMP will set forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected for evaluation. The PEMP will include, per 48 CFR 16.402-1, a cost incentive (or constraint). The criteria in the PEMP should be objective but may also include subjective criteria. The PEMP will set forth the method by which the total available fee amount will be allocated, and the total available fee amount earned will be determined.

        (3) The PEMP may be revised, either unilaterally (by DOE) or bilaterally, during the evaluation period. If it is revised, the Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor—

        (i) Of unilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least ninety calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period and at least thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of the revision;

        (ii) Of bilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least sixty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period;

        (iii) Of urgent and high priority revisions, whether made unilaterally or bilaterally, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period.

        (e)  The FDO shall issue the final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance with the schedule set forth in the PEMP or as otherwise set forth in this contract.

        (1) The determination for the evaluation period must be made within the later of: sixty calendar days after the receipt by the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's self-assessment, if one is required or permitted; seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.

        (2) If the FDO elects to evaluate the Contractor's performance of any specific requirements upon their completion, the determination of any fee amount earned must be made: within seventy calendar days of the requirements' completion; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.

        (3) If the determination is not made within the periods stated above, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest on the total available fee amount earned at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 7109) that is in effect on the payment date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and is published in the  semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual date the determination is made. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the total available fee amount earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.

        970.5215-2   [Reserved]

#### § 970.5215-2

        970.5215-3   Conditional payment of fee, profit, and other incentives—facility management contracts

#### § 970.5215-3

        As prescribed in 970.1504-3(b), insert the following clause:

        (a)  “Amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period” means the quantity the Contracting Officer or Fee Determining Official determines the Contractor is due for its performance in consideration of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan, Award Fee Plan, or similar document prior to a separate determination that the Contractor did not comply with a term or condition of the contract or experienced a failure relating to: environment, safety, and health or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. If the contract includes incentives allocable to more than one evaluation period, the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period includes the allocable amount of payment for each such incentive for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives. The allocable amount is the total amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the incentive covered. “Amount actually payable to the Contractor for an evaluation period” means: (the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period) less (the amount of any reduction under this clause and the amount of any reductions under other clauses to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period).

        (b)  (Note: If this contract does not include the Security Requirements clause (48 CFR 952.204-2), the requirements of this clause related to security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information do not apply.)

        (1) The amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for any evaluation period under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's and the Contractor's employees' compliance during the evaluation period with the performance requirements of this contract relating to:

        (i) Environment, safety and health (ES&H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&H); and

        (ii) Security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.

        (2) The ES&H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&H terms and conditions, including the DOE-approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&H compliance.

        (3) The security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of this contract are set forth in: the clause of this contract entitled, “Security Requirements”; the clause of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives”; and other terms and conditions of this contract.

        (4) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&H or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information during any evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” the amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or other incentives for the evaluation period may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer.

        (c)  (1) The Contracting Officer will unilaterally determine the amount of reduction to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period based on the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees of failure specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause. The percent reduction for each performance failure will be: not less than 26% nor more than 100% for a first degree failure; not less than 11% or more than 26% for a second degree failure; and no more than 11% for a third degree failure.

        (2) For a reduction allocable to more than one evaluation period, the Government will effect the allocation at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount of the reduction. The allocable amount is the total reduction amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the reduction covered.

        (3) The Government will reduce the payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after becoming aware.

        (4) In determining the reduction and in applying the mitigating factors, the Contracting Officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&H, and security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site-specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition or guidance for the amount of reduction or for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the Contracting Office must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the reduction that would be appropriate absent mitigating factors. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following (paragraphs (c)(4)(v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) of this clause apply to ES&H only):

        (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident;

        (ii) Efforts the Contractor made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance;

        (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence;

        (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&H and compliance in related areas; or of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas;

        (v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&H standards are routinely practiced;

        (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor ( offsite emergency response);

        (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making ( policy, ES&H programs); and

        (viii) Contractor demonstration that an operating experience and feedback program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&H by use of lessons learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.

        (d)

        (1) The amount of the reduction under this clause for an evaluation period, in combination with the amount of any reduction under any other clause, shall not exceed the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period.

        (2) If at any time during the contract any reductions under this clause or other clauses result in the sum of the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives to exceed the sum of the amounts of actually payable to the Contractor, the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government.

        (3) At the end of the contract—

        (i) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of amounts actually payable to the Contractor exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or

        (ii) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of the amounts actually payable to the Contractor.

        (e)  Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&H terms and conditions, including applicable ES&H laws, regulations, DOE directives, and the DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are:

        (1)  Performance failures most adverse to ES&H are first degree. They include:

        (i) Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS. (The Government will perform necessary reviews in a timely manner and not unreasonably withhold approval.)

        (ii) Performance failures determined, per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, serious injury or death to a worker.

        (iii) Occurrence of any accident or event that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) and results in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.

        (2)  Performance failures significantly adverse to ES&H are second degree. They include:

        (i) Failures to comply with an approved ISMS.

        (ii) Failures that have been determined, per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an actual injury, exposure, or exceedance that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences.

        (iii) A breakdown of the Safety Management System.

        (iv) The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:

        (A) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in an accident that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) but not resulting in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.

        (B) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives that results in a near miss of an accident or event that could have resulted in an adverse effect and a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board. (A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, that does not result in an adverse effect.)

        (3)  Performance failures determined per applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives to reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&H are third degree. They include:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable ES&H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in potential breakdown of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:

        (A) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external ( Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 231.B (or successor Order) requirements; or internal oversight of 10 CFR parts 830, 835, 850, and 851, or DOE Orders 227.1A and 436.1 (or successor Order) requirements.

        (B) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external ( Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.

        (C) Non-compliances that have, or may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment or that indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.

        (D) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.

        (f)  Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee, profit, or other incentives will be determined are as follows:

        (1)  Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security are first degree. The following are examples:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.

        (2)  Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security are second degree. The following are examples:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.

        (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.

        (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this clause).

        (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Secret.

        (3)  Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security are third degree. This category also includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future more severe performance failures and/or conditions that if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples:

        (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.

        (ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.

        (iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.

        (iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures that by themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

Such terms and conditions must be consistent with the terms, conditions, and requirements of the Contractor's contract with DOE. The Contractor may use DOE-approved contract terms and conditions as delineated in the current version of DOE Order 481.1 or terms and conditions previously approved by the responsible Contracting Officer or authorized designee for agreements with non-Federal entities. The Contractor must not hold itself out as representing DOE when negotiating the proposed SPP agreement.

        (2) With the exception of a SPP project using a Contracting Officer approved MSW, the Contractor must submit all SPP projects to the DOE Contracting Officer for DOE review and approval. The Contactor shall also include in any request for DOE SPP project approval a listing of any associated background intellectual property having a prior assignment, exclusive licensing or option for exclusive licensing. The Contractor may not start work under a SPP project until it has received notice of DOE approval except when the work falls under an approved MSW.

        (3) The Contractor is authorized to reserve the intellectual property indemnity clause for Federally-funded sponsors, state and local governments and public universities.

        970.5217-2   Agreements for commercializing technology.

#### § 970.5217-2

        As prescribed in 970.1708-3, insert the following clause:

        (a) This clause authorizes the use of the mechanism, Agreements for Commercializing Technology (ACT). In accordance with the requirements specified in this clause, the M&O Contractor may conduct third party-sponsored research at the M&O Contractor's risk. While the Department believes ACT has the potential to greatly assist in the commercialization of technologies, it also specifically recognizes that ACT can be used for other engagements with outside entities that are not necessary aimed at commercialization ( technical assistance, training, studies), but that facilitate access to DOE facilities. In performing ACT work, the M&O Contractor may use staff and other resources associated with this M&O contract for the purposes of conducting technical services, training, studies, performing research and development, and/or furthering the technology transfer mission of the Department, only when such work does not interfere with DOE-funded activities conducted as authorized by other parts of this M&O contract. Any allocation of resources that adversely affects work for DOE due to performing ACT work is the responsibility of the M&O Contractor. The resources that may be used include Government-owned or leased facilities, equipment, or other property that is either in the M&O Contractor's custody or available to the M&O Contractor under this M&O contract (unless specifically excluded by the Contracting Officer). For M&O Contractor activities conducted under authority of this clause, the M&O Contractor shall provide full-cost recovery, assume indemnification and liability as provided in paragraph (b)(9) below, and may assume other risks normally borne by private parties sponsoring research at the DOE national laboratories and production plants. In exchange for accepting such risks, or for other private consideration provided by the M&O Contractor, the M&O Contractor is authorized to negotiate separate ACT agreements with the sponsoring third parties. Under ACT agreements, the M&O Contractor may charge those parties additional compensation beyond the full costs of the work at the facility.

        (b) The following applies to all work conducted under the ACT mechanism, regardless of the source of funding:

        (1)  Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 ) and other applicable authorities, the M&O Contractor may perform work for non-Federal entities, in accordance with the requirements of this clause.

        (2)  For ACT work conducted under the contract, the M&O Contractor must draft, implement, and maintain formal policies, practices, and procedures in accordance with this clause, which must be approved by the Contracting Officer, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        (3)  The M&O Contractor: (i) Must not perform ACT activities that would place it in direct competition with the private sector;

        (ii) May only conduct work under this clause if the work does not interfere with or adversely affect projects and programs the M&O Contractor conducts on behalf of the DOE under this contract, and complies with the terms and conditions of the prime contract If the Government determines that an activity conducted under this clause interferes with the Department's work under the M&O contract, or that termination/stay/suspension of work under an ACT agreement is in the best interest of the Government, the M&O Contractor must stop the interfering ACT work immediately to the extent necessary to resolve the interference. At any time, the Contracting Officer may require the use of specified Government-owned or leased property and facilities for the exclusive use of the DOE mission by providing a written notice excluding said property from the M&O Contractor's activities under this clause. Any cost incurred as a result of Contracting Officer decisions identified in this paragraph shall be borne by the M&O Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall provide to the M&O Contractor in writing its decision, identifying the issues and reasons for the decisions. The M&O Contractor shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to address and resolve the issues identified by the Contracting Officer;

        (iii) Except as otherwise excluded in this clause, must perform all ACT activities in accordance with the standards, policies, and procedures that apply to performance under this M&O contract, including but not limited to environmental, safety and health, security, safeguards, conflict of interest and classification procedures, and human and animal research regulations;

        (iv) Must maintain and provide when requested by the DOE Contracting Officer, a summary of project information for each active ACT project, consisting of: sponsor name; total estimated costs; project title and description; project point of contact; and estimated start and completion dates;

        (v) Is responsible for addressing the following items in ACT agreements as appropriate: disposition of property acquired under the agreement; export control; notice of intellectual property infringement; and a statement that the Government and/or the M&O Contractor shall have the right to perform similar services in the Statement of Work for other Parties as otherwise authorized by this M&O contract subject to applicable data restrictions;

        (vi) Must include a standard legal disclaimer notice on all publications generated under ACT activities. Each DOE M&O Contractor has its own pre-approved publications statement, and this should be included; and

        (vii) Must insert the following disclaimer in each agreement under ACT, which must be conspicuous ( bold type, all capital letters, or large font) in all Agreements under ACT so as to meet the standards of due notice.

        DISCLAIMER

        THIS AGREEMENT IS SOLELY BETWEEN [INSERT NAME OF THE M&O CONTRACTOR] AND [THE OTHER IDENTIFIED PARTY]. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS  A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS AGREEMENT DOES _NOT_ CREATE ANY OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE RESEARCH OR ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, GENERATED INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT MADE OR DEVELOPED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE OWNERSHIP, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH OR RESULTING PRODUCT; THAT THE GOODS, SERVICES, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, INFORMATION, OR DATA TO BE FURNISHED HEREUNDER WILL ACCOMPLISH INTENDED RESULTS OR ARE SAFE FOR ANY PURPOSE INCLUDING THE INTENDED PURPOSE; OR THAT ANY OF THE ABOVE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH PRIVATELY OWNED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH RESEARCH OR RESULTING PRODUCT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, GENERATED INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT MADE OR DELIVERED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT ANY RIGHTS THE GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE AGAINST THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM WORK CONDUCTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

        (4)  (i) Subject to DOE approval as described in this paragraph, the M&O Contractor is hereby authorized to negotiate terms and conditions between the M&O Contractor and third parties when entering into ACT agreements. The M&O Contractor will have no authority to bind the Government in any way with such terms and conditions. The Government will have no obligation to the M&O Contractor due to such terms and conditions.

        (ii) The M&O Contractor shall submit an ACT proposal package (Package) to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to beginning work under an ACT agreement.

        (A) A complete Package will include at a minimum: the identity of the parties to the ACT agreement; the principal place of performance; any foreign ownership or control of the ACT agreement parties; a Statement of Work; an estimate of costs incurred under the M&O contract; an anticipated schedule; identification of key Government equipment and facilities that will be used under the ACT agreement; a list of expected deliverables; identification of the Intellectual Property (IP) lead and proposed selection of IP rights, as defined in DOE Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013; a signed certification by the private party(ies) that the M&O Contractor offered the option to use Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) alternatives (see paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this clause) sufficiently such that the private parties are aware of the relative costs and other differences between the ACT agreement and the CRADA and SPP alternatives; source of funds, including a statement that no Federal funds, including pass-through funds received as a subcontractor or partner, are being utilized; applicable ES&H and NEPA documentation; a statement of consideration, summarizing the risk and/or consideration offered the ACT participants in exchange for charging beyond full cost recovery or for other compensation provided by the participants; and when multiple third parties are parties to the ACT agreement, or as otherwise requested by the Contracting Officer, an IP Management Plan that sets forth the proposed disposition of IP rights, and income and royalty sharing, among the parties to an ACT agreement.

        (B) If the M&O Contractor, the M&O Contractor's parent, member, subsidiary, or other entity in which the M&O Contractor, the M&O Contractor's parent, member or subsidiary has an equity interest, is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&O Contractor shall include as necessary a project-specific addendum to the Master OCI Plan in the Package to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the prior approved Master OCI Plan (see paragraph (b)(7) of this clause).

        (C) If the ACT agreement includes a foreign entity as a party or the statement of work includes the use of human subjects, animal subjects, classified or sensitive subject matter or describes a work scope involving high risks or hazards including environmental issues, the M&O Contractor shall include additional information as necessary or as requested by the Contracting Officer.

        (iii) The Contracting Officer shall use reasonable best efforts to review each complete Package submitted by the M&O Contractor under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this clause within 10 business days of receiving the Package and provide the M&O Contractor with approval or non-approval of the Package. The review of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer shall include a determination that the proposed work: is consistent with or complementary to DOE missions and the contract statement of work; will not adversely impact programs under the contract scope of work; will not place the contractor in direct competition with the domestic private sector; and will not create a detrimental future burden on DOE resources.

        (iv) Except as conditionally allowed under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this clause, the Contracting Officer must approve the Package before the M&O Contractor may begin work under the proposed ACT agreement. If the Contracting Officer rejects the Package, then the Contracting Officer must provide said rejection to the M&O Contractor in writing including the reasons for the rejection. Upon receipt of the Contracting Officer's written rejection, the M&O Contractor agrees to not further pursue the work described in the package or incur additional costs under the M&O contract for the work described in the Package.

        (A) The M&O Contractor may request a preliminary determination that the proposed scope of work is consistent with the contract statement of work and the Contracting Officer will use his/her best efforts to provide such a determination within three business days. Upon such a determination from the Contracting Officer, the M&O Contractor may begin work under the ACT agreement at the M&O Contractor's risk pending final approval of the complete Package. The M&O Contractor must submit a complete Package, as identified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this clause, within 10 business days of the preliminary determination. All costs associated with the performance of work under a preliminary determination are the responsibility of the M&O Contractor, as no Federal funds will be used to fund any work conducted under this clause.

        (B) If any source affiliated with the M&O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&O Contractor or its parent company) is a party sponsoring work in connection with the ACT agreement, work may not commence until approval of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer.

        (5)  The M&O Contractor shall be responsible for providing adequate advance payment for ACT work conducted under this clause consistent with procedures defined in the Department's Financial Management Handbook. The M&O Contractor shall be solely responsible for collecting payments from third parties for any work conducted under this clause and such collections shall be independent of providing advance payment. For such payments and for any costs, obligations, or liabilities arising due to the M&O Contractor's work under this clause, the M&O Contractor is entirely at risk and the Government shall have no risk.

        (6)  (i) All direct costs associated with the M&O Contractor's work conducted under this clause shall be directly charged to separate and identifiable accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Department's Financial Management Handbook. An allocable portion of indirect costs normally applied to equivalent work under this M&O contract shall also be applied to work conducted under this clause in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Management Handbook. As required by the Financial Management Handbook, changes to the Handbook will be incorporated into this clause by a unilateral administrative modification to the contract. In addition, all work must be performed at full costs that would include Federal Administrative Charge (FAC).

        (ii) Work conducted under this clause shall be excluded from the M&O contract award fee calculations and such fee shall not be allocable to work conducted under this clause.

        (7)  The M&O Contractor shall conduct work under this clause in a manner that minimizes the appearance of conflicts of interest and avoids or mitigates actual conflicts of interest with the M&O Contractor's functions under this M&O contract. Accordingly, the M&O Contractor shall develop an Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan (OCI Plan). The OCI Plan should address OCI issues that arise as a result of the M&O Contractor taking a financial interest in ACT projects, especially in those cases where the M&O Contractor retains rights in ACT IP. Said OCI Plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for review and approval as soon as practicable after execution of the M&O contract modification incorporating this clause into the M&O contract. Unless provided otherwise by the Contracting Officer, no work on ACT agreements may commence before Contracting Officer approval of the OCI Plan. In addition to those elements expressly stated in the OCI Plan, the Department may condition any ACT transaction on such other mitigating conditions it determines are appropriate. The OCI Plan shall, at a minimum, include elements that address the following:

        (i)  Before work can begin under an ACT transaction, all parties to ACT agreements must sign a DOE-approved certification that they have been fully informed about the availability of SPP agreements and CRADAs in addition to ACT. The certification at a minimum shall briefly describe SPP agreements, CRADAs and ACT, and will include the relative disposition of IP rights and the costs (including identification of any additional costs  insurance, and other compensation to the M&O Contractor under ACT) for each type of agreement for the scope of work being proposed.

        (ii)  The M&O Contractor shall not give work under ACT any special attention or priority over other work under the DOE M&O contract. Work under ACT shall be approved by the Contracting Officer and assigned the same priority relative to other work under the DOE M&O contract that it would normally have if performed under a non-Federal SPP agreement. The Contracting Officer has discretion to determine the agency's priority of work, considering the M&O Contractor's input.

        (iii)  If any source affiliated with the M&O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&O Contractor or its parent company) is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&O Contractor shall include as necessary an addendum to the OCI Plan to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the OCI Plan.

        (iv)  The Contracting Officer, upon request of DOE Patent Counsel may inquire into the M&O Contractor's designation of any invention or data as arising under an ACT transaction. The M&O Contractor is responsible for curing any defect identified in such inquiry, and if the M&O Contractor cannot adequately justify the designation or cure the defect, then the parties to the ACT agreement may receive modified rights in the IP to the degree necessary to resolve the issues identified by the inquiry.

        (8)  Disposition of intellectual property (IP) arising from work conducted under this clause shall be governed by Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013 (ACT Class Waiver), which is incorporated herein by reference.

        (i) All Contractor ACT inventions shall be reported to DOE pursuant to the requirements of the [] clause of this M&O contract.

        (ii) In reporting ACT inventions, the M&O Contractor shall identify the ACT agreement under which the invention was made and specify the rights reserved by the Government pursuant to the ACT Class Waiver.

        (iii) All technical data identified by the ACT client as Protected ACT Information shall also be marked to identify the ACT agreement under which the data was generated.

        (iv) The M&O Contractor shall ensure that all rights and obligations concerning ACT IP, including the appropriate IP provisions authorized in the ACT Class Waiver, are clearly provided in ACT agreements, and that all parties granted any rights in ACT IP are informed of the terms of the waived rights, including the rights reserved by the Government.

        (v) Where the M&O Contractor receives ownership or license rights to ACT IP, the M&O Contractor may elect to commercialize the ACT IP consistent with the Technology Transfer Mission clause of this M&O contract.

        (vi) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(8)(v) of this clause, if the M&O Contractor has an authorized Private Funded Technology Transfer (PFTT) program, the M&O Contractor may elect to retain private ownership of the ACT IP and commercialize the IP under its applicable PFTT clause, using its private funds, where no costs for developing, patenting, and marketing will be allowable under this M&O contract. The M&O Contractor will share royalties collected on ACT IP with inventors in accordance with paragraph (h) of the Technology Transfer Mission clause of this M&O contract.

        (vii) For ACT projects in which the terms of the Agreement provide that the Government reserves the right to use generated data after the particular project expires, the M&O Contractor must provide, to the DOE Office of Technical Information (OSTI), computer software produced under the Agreement in both source and executable object code format.

        (viii) Where terms and conditions governing Data and Subject Inventions under this Contract are inconsistent with the terms of the ACT Class Waiver, the ACT Class Waiver will control.

        (9)

        (i)  (A) The M&O Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, the Department, and persons acting on their behalf from all liability, including costs and expenses incurred, to any person, including the ACT participants, for injury to or death of persons or other living things or injury to or destruction of property arising out of the performance of an ACT transaction by the Government, the Department, the M&O Contractor, or persons acting on their behalf, or arising out of the use of the services performed, materials supplied, or information given hereunder by any person including the M&O Contractor, and not directly resulting from the fault or negligence of the Government, the Department, or persons (other than the M&O Contractor) acting on their behalf.

        (B) Subject to Contracting Officer approval, the General Indemnity set forth in this paragraph (b)(9)(i) may be modified or waived where:

        () ACT participants are not providing material or equipment to the M&O Contractor to be used in the performance of the Statement of Work under the ACT transaction; and () ACT participants are not sending their employees to the M&O facilities as part of the Statement of Work; and () the specific activities performed under the ACT transaction are normally performed by the DOE M&O Contractor under the DOE contract.

        (C) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(A) and (B) of this clause, the M&O Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government, the Department, and persons acting on their behalf for loss, damage, or destruction of Government property resulting from the fault or negligence of the M&O Contractor. Such indemnification shall be subject to a liability limit of $2,000,000 (two million dollars) per year, or such greater liability limit approved by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer under the DOE contract. Above the applicable liability limit, the M&O Contractor's responsibility to the Government for such loss, damage or destruction, shall be as set forth in the “Property” clause of this contract.

        (ii)  The M&O Contractor shall indemnify the Government, its agents, and employees against liability, including costs, for infringement of any United States patent, copyright, or other intellectual property arising out of any acts required or directed to be performed under the Statement of Work under an ACT transaction to the extent such acts are not already performed at the M&O contract facilities. Such indemnity shall not apply to a claimed infringement that is settled without the consent of the M&O Contractor unless required by a court of competent jurisdiction.

        (iii)  (A) Except for any liability resulting from any negligent acts or omissions of the Government, the M&O Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising from personal injury or property damage occurring as a result of the making, using, or selling of a product, process, or service by or on behalf of the ACT participants or the M&O Contractor, their assignees, or licensees, which was derived from the work performed under ACT transactions. With respect to this clause, neither the Government nor the M&O Contractor shall be considered assignees or licensees as a result of reserved Government rights in ACT IP. The indemnity set forth in this paragraph shall apply only if the M&O Contractor shall have been informed as soon and as completely as practical by the Government of the action alleging such claim and shall have been given an opportunity, to the maximum extent afforded by applicable laws, rules, or regulations, to participate in and control its defense, and the Government shall have provided all reasonably available information and reasonable assistance requested by the M&O Contractor. No settlement for which the M&O Contractor would be responsible shall be made without the M&O Contractor's consent, unless required by final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

        (B) Where the M&O Contractor assigns the responsibility for indemnifying the Government under paragraph (b)(9)(iii)(A) of this clause to other ACT participants, the M&O Contractor agrees to seek such indemnification from the other ACT participants.

        (iv)  Claims and liabilities resulting from the M&O Contractor's performance of work under an ACT transaction authorized pursuant to this clause shall not be subject to the M&O contract clause entitled “Insurance—Litigation and Claims.” In no event shall the M&O Contractor be reimbursed under the M&O contract for liabilities (and expenses incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs, counsel fees, and judgment and settlements) incurred as a result of third party claims related to the M&O Contractor's performance under this clause.

        (v)  The M&O Contractor shall not include any guarantee or requirement that will obligate the Government to pay or incur any costs or create any liability on behalf of the Government in any ACT agreement or commitment the M&O Contractor executes under authority of this clause. The M&O Contractor agrees if the Contractor does include such a guarantee or requirement, it will have no effect on the Government, such that, the M&O Contractor will be responsible for any costs or liability due to such a guarantee or requirement.

        (vi)  Any cost of insurance to cover risks of the M&O Contractor associated with ACT agreements is unallowable under this contract.

        (10)  All records associated with the M&O Contractor's activities conducted under the authority of this clause, with the exception of information required under paragraphs (b)(3)(v), (b)(4)(ii)(A), and (b)(13) of this clause shall be treated as M&O Contractor-owned records under the provisions of the Access to and Ownership of Records clause of this M&O contract. The Government or its designees shall use such records in accordance with applicable Federal laws (including the Privacy Act), as appropriate.

        (11)  The Government or the M&O Contractor may terminate ACT authority under this contract by providing written notification of termination to the other party (Contracting Officer or the M&O Contractor) as appropriate, no less than 60 days prior to the requested termination date. In such cases, the M&O Contractor shall provide DOE a comprehensive list of active ACT projects. DOE anticipates work commitments under these agreements will be completed regardless of termination. All costs associated with early termination of any ACT agreements prior to the completion shall be the responsibility of the M&O Contractor.

        (12)  To minimize the potential for negative Government programmatic impact and to facilitate seamless transition of work to a successor M&O Contractor, ACT agreement(s) executed under this clause and any contractual instruments associated therewith may be novated to the successor M&O Contractor with the mutual consent of the M&O Contractor, the successor M&O Contractor, and the parties to the affected ACT agreement(s). If the ACT agreement(s) cannot be novated, then the M&O Contractor as a private sponsor shall be permitted to enter into a Non-Federal SPP agreement with the successor M&O Contractor that will enable completion of the statement of work. Such agreements shall be entered into pursuant to DOE SPP policies. DOE shall make good faith efforts to incorporate the terms of the applicable ACT agreement.

        (13)  The M&O Contractor shall maintain records of its activities related to ACT in a manner and to the extent satisfactory to DOE and specifically including, but not limited to the number of ACT agreements, the amount of funds reimbursed to DOE for work under ACT and aggregate funding received beyond costs in the performance of ACT, the number of third party entities engaged through ACT that had not previously sponsored projects under the M&O contract and the number that had not previously sponsored projects under any DOE M&O contract, the amount of funds reimbursed to DOE by newly engaged entities, the number of parties and types of entities engaged in each individual ACT agreement, and the number of invention disclosures, licenses and start-ups arising from ACT. The M&O Contractor shall establish performance metric(s) to measure the time required to negotiate ACT agreements in a manner consistent with the time required to negotiate CRADAs and SPPs. The M&O Contractor shall obtain from each entity engaged in ACT the entity's reason(s) for selecting ACT for performance of work under the M&O contract. Also, the M&O Contractor shall report the above identified data annually to the DOE Contracting Officer and in such a format that will serve to adequately inform DOE of the Contractor's activities under ACT while protecting any data not subject to disclosure under this M&O contract. Such records shall be made available in accordance with the clauses of this M&O contract pertaining to inspection, audit and examination of records.

        (4) In the performance of DOE contracted obligations, each Contractor is required to manage scientific and technical information (STI) produced under the contract as a direct and integral part of the work and ensure its broad availability to all customer segments by making STI available to DOE's central STI coordinating office, OSTI. Requirements for all such reportable information to OSTI are in DOE Order 241.1B, or successor version, whether it is publicly releasable, controlled unclassified information, or classified.

        (c)  (1) The Contractor agrees not to mark, register, or otherwise assert copyright in any data in a published or unpublished work, other than as set forth in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this clause.

        (2) Except for material to which the Contractor has obtained the right to assert copyright in accordance with paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this clause, the Contractor agrees not to include in the data delivered under this Contract any material copyrighted by the Contractor and not to knowingly include any material copyrighted by others without first granting or obtaining at no cost a license therein for the benefit of the Government of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (d) of this clause. If the Contractor believes that such copyrighted material for which the license cannot be obtained must be included in the data to be delivered, rather than merely incorporated therein by reference, the Contractor shall obtain the written authorization of the contracting officer to include such material in the data prior to its delivery.

        (3) If the Contractor has not been granted permission to copyright data or computer software first produced under the contract where such permission is necessary,  for works other than scientific and technical journal articles and data produced under a CRADA, and if the Government desires to obtain copyright in such data or computer software, the Patent Counsel may direct the Contractor to establish claim to copyright in such data or computer software and to assign such copyright to the Government or its designated assignee.

        (d)  (1) The Contractor shall have the right to assert, without prior approval of the contracting officer, copyright subsisting in scientific and technical works composed under this contract or based on or containing data first produced by the Contractor in the performance of this Contract, and published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia, proceedings, contributions to chapters of book compilations or similar means of dissemination to make broadly available to the public or scientific community for the purpose of scientific, research, knowledge and education. Such scientific and technical works may be recorded or fixed in any medium including but not limited to print, online, web, audio, video or other medium, and released or disseminated through any communication or distribution channel including but not limited to articles, reports, books, non-architectural drawings, repositories, videos, websites, workshops, or social media. When assertion of copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) on the data when such data are delivered to the Government as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government.

        (2) For each scientific or technical work first produced or composed under this contract and submitted for publication or similar means of dissemination, the contractor shall provide notice to the publisher of the Government's license in the copyright that is substantially similar to or otherwise references one of the following notices below:

        A suitable notice (long version) reflecting the Government's non-exclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in the copyright.

        This work was produced by [insert the name of the Contractor] under contract No. [insert the contract number] with the U.S. Department of Energy. The United States Government retains and the publisher, by accepting the work for publication, acknowledges that the United States Government retains a non-exclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license to publish or reproduce the published form of this work, or allow others to do so, for United States Government purposes. The Department of Energy will provide public access to these results of federally sponsored research in accordance with the DOE Public Access Plan

        A suitable notice (short version) reflecting the Government's non-exclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in the copyright follows:

        This work was produced by [insert the name of the Contractor] under Contract No. [insert the contract number] with the U.S. Department of Energy. Publisher acknowledges the U.S. Government license to provide public access under the DOE Public Access Plan

        (3) The title to the copyright of the original of unclassified graduate theses and the original of related unclassified scientific papers shall vest in the author thereof, subject to the right of DOE to retain duplicates of such documents and to use such documents for any purpose whatsoever without any claim on the part of the author or the contractor for additional compensation.

        (e)  The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subsisting in technical data and computer software first produced by the Contractor in performance of this Contract, when the Contractor needs to control distribution to advance the goals of the technology transfer mission and where the Contractor can show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright protection, subject to the following:

        (1)  (i) For data other than scientific and technical works under paragraph (d) of this clause and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include:

        (A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes;

        (B) The program under which it was funded;

        (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement;

        (D) Whether the data is subject to export control; and if so, which jurisdiction;

        (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period; and

        (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities.

        (ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.

        (iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined exclusively by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release:

        (A) Would be detrimental to national security,  involve classified information or data or sensitive information under section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes;

        (B) Would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data;

        (C) Would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness;

        (D) Would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements; or

        (E) Would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs.

        (iv) The Contractor will obtain the advanced written approval of the Patent Counsel to assert copyright where data are determined to be in the following excepted categories:

        (A) Under export control restrictions;

        (B) Developed with Naval Reactors' funding;

        (C) Subject to disposition of data rights under treaties and international agreements. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified at DOE's Office of International Affairs (International Commitments—IEC).

        (2)  The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 60 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor. If Patent Counsel grants permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in computer software, the permission automatically extends to subsequent minor versions ( minor revisions, patches and bug fixes) having the same funding source, same name and substantially same functionality as the original computer software, and may be extended to subsequent major versions representing significant modifications of the program with the approval of Patent Counsel.

        (3)  (i) For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish, or make available to the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in accordance with OSTI guidelines at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause:

        (A) Announcement information/metadata contained in the Software Announcement Notice 241.4;

        (B) the source code and/or executable file for each software program; and

        (C) Documentation, if any, which may consist of a user manual, sample test cases, or similar information, needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software (whether included on the software media itself or provided in a separate file or in paper format).

        (ii) The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.

        (iii) Unless otherwise directed by the Patent Counsel, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish, or make available to OSTI in accordance with OSTI guidelines, a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder.

        (iv) Once the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor may begin to commercialize the copyrighted data by making copyrighted data available for licensing to third parties and by offering other types of distribution to third parties. During the period in which commercialization activities pertaining to the copyrighted data are continuing, or for a specified period of time prescribed by Patent Counsel in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. For all previously approved and current copyrighted data that the Contractor is actively commercializing, the Contractor may continue to commercialize in accordance with this paragraph.

        (v) When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright or at the end of the specified period as prescribed by Patent Counsel, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.

        (vi) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for copyrighted data, the Contractor shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and, upon request, assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the copyrighted data to the public. When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities, the Contractor will provide to OSTI the latest version of the copyrighted data (for example, source code, object code, minimal support documentation, drawings or updated manuals.) In addition, the Contractor will provide annually to Patent Counsel, if requested, a list of all copyrighted data that the Contractor has abandoned commercial licensing activity during that year.

        (vii) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office, or when submitted for publication. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be substantially similar to the following:

        These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. ___ with the Department of Energy. During the period of commercialization or such other time period specified by the Department of Energy, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Subsequent to that period the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data, apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.

        (viii) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the period that Contractor is commercializing the data as provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause. Before licensing under this paragraph, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65—“Appeals.”

        (ix) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.

        (4) The following notice may be included in computer software prior to any publication or release and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause.

        This computer software was prepared by [insert the Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the Department of Energy (DOE). All rights in the computer software are reserved by DOE on behalf of the United States Government and the Contractor as provided in the Contract. You are authorized to use this computer software for Governmental purposes but it is not to be released or distributed to the public. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE CONTRACTOR MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ASSUMES ANY LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. This notice including this sentence must appear on any copies of this computer software.

        (5) A similar notice can be used for data, other than computer software, prior to any publication or release and prior to Contractor's obtaining permission of DOE Patent Counsel to assert copyright.

        (f)  The Contractor may release computer software first produced by the Contractor in the performance of this contract under an open source software license. Such software shall hereinafter be referred to as open source software or OSS, subject to the following:

        (1)  (i) The Contractor shall provide written notice (including relevant data such as, for example, the software disclosure form) to each DOE Program or Programs that have provided a substantial portion of the funding (funding source(s)) to develop the software that the Contractor intends to release as OSS unless the funding Program(s) has previously provided blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that Program or a specific DOE project stipulates the software to be released as OSS. If Program has neither consented nor objected to the assertion of copyright within two weeks of such written notification, the Contractor may assert copyright in the software. If notification of a funding DOE Program(s) is not practicable or DOE Program(s) has objected, the Contractor shall consult with Patent Counsel, which may provide approval. For software developed under a CRADA, Strategic Partnership Projects (SPP), User Facility Agreement, or Agreement for Commercializing Technology (ACT), authorization from the partner of such agreement shall be additionally obtained for OSS release unless such agreement has a provision providing for such copyright assertion.

        (ii) If the software is developed with funding from a federal government agency or agencies (funding source(s)) other than DOE, then authorization from all the funding agency(ies) shall be obtained for OSS release, if practicable. Such federal government agency(ies) may provide blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that agency(ies). However, OSS release of any one of such software shall be subject to approval by all other funding sources for the software, if any. If approval from such federal government agency(ies) is not practicable, the Patent Counsel may provide approval instead.

        (2)  Once the Contractor has met the program approval requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, copyright in the software to be distributed as OSS may be asserted by the Contractor, or, for OSS developed under a CRADA, User Facility Agreement, or SPP Agreement, either by the Contractor, CRADA Participant, User Facility User, or SPP Sponsor, as applicable, which precludes marking such OSS as protectable from public distribution.

        (3)  The Contractor must submit Software Announcement Notice (AN) 241.4 (or the current notice as may be required by DOE) to OSTI. In the AN 241.4, the Contractor shall provide the unique URL ( a persistent identifier) from which the software can be obtained so that OSTI can announce the availability of the OSS and the public has access via the URL.

        (4)  The Contractor must maintain a record of all software distributed as OSS. Upon request of the Patent Counsel, the Contractor shall provide the necessary information regarding any or all OSS.

        (5)  The Contractor shall ensure that the OSS is publicly accessible as open source via the Contractor's website, Open Source Bulletin Boards operated by third parties, DOE, or other standard industry methods.

        (6)  Each OSS will be distributed pursuant to an OSS license. The Contractor may choose among industry standard OSS licenses or create its own set of Contractor standard licenses. To assist the Contractor, the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property, may periodically issue guidance on OSS licenses. Each Contractor-created OSS license, must contain, at a minimum, the following provisions—

        (i) A disclaimer or equivalent that disclaims the Government's and Contractor's liability for licensees' and third parties' use of the software; and

        (ii) A grant of permission for licensee to distribute OSS containing the licensee's derivative works. This provision may allow the licensee and third parties to commercialize their derivative works or might request that the licensee's derivative works be forwarded to the Contractor for incorporation into future OSS versions.

        (7)  OSS distributed in accordance with this section shall not be subject to the requirements relating to indemnification of the Contractor or Federal Government, U.S. Competitiveness and U.S. Preference, as set forth in paragraphs (f) and (g) of the clause within this contract entitled Technology Transfer Mission (48 CFR 970.5227-3).

The Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee shall provide a program mission impact statement and shall include an impact statement regarding related Intellectual Property rights known by the Contractor to be owned by the Government to assist the contracting officer in the approval determination.

        (ii) The Contractor shall also include (specific to the proposed CRADA) a statement of compliance with the Fairness of Opportunity requirements of paragraph (e) of this clause.

        (iii) Within thirty (30) days after submission of a JWS, MSW or proposed CRADA, the contracting officer shall approve, disapprove or request modification to the JWS, MSW or CRADA. The contracting officer shall provide a written explanation to the Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee of any disapproval or requirement for modification of a JWS or proposed CRADA.

        (iv) Except as otherwise directed in writing by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall not enter into, or begin work under, a CRADA until approval of the CRADA or relevant MSW has been granted by the contracting officer. The Contractor may submit its proposed CRADA to the contracting officer at the time of submitting its proposed JWS, relevant MSW or any time thereafter.

        (2)  The Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee in deciding what CRADA to enter into shall:

        (i) Give special consideration to small business firms, and consortia involving small business firms;

        (ii) Give preference to business units located in the United States which agree that products or processes embodying Intellectual Property will be substantially manufactured or practiced in the United States and, in the case of any industrial organization or other person subject to the control of a foreign company or government, take into consideration whether or not such foreign government permits United States agencies, organizations, or other persons to enter into cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements. The Contractor, in considering these factors, may rely upon the information and same sources as referenced in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this clause;

        (iii) Provide Fairness of Opportunity in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this clause; and

        (iv) Give consideration to the Conflicts of Interest requirements of paragraph (d) of this clause.

        (3)  (i) Data that is first produced as a result of research and development activities conducted under a CRADA and that would be a trade secret or commercial or financial data that would be privileged or confidential, if such data had been obtained from a non-Federal third party, may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(7)) for a period as agreed in the CRADA of up to five (5) years from the time the data is first produced or otherwise as delineated in Stevenson-Wydler, as amended. The DOE shall cooperate with the Contractor in protecting such data.

        (ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such restrictions.

        (iii) A final technical report, upon completion of a CRADA, shall be provided to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information; reports marked as Protected CRADA Information will not be released to the public for a period in accordance with the terms of the CRADA.

        (iv) In addition to its authority to license Intellectual Property, the Contractor may enter into licensing agreements with third parties for data developed by the Contractor under a CRADA subject to other provisions of this Contract. However, the Contractor shall neither use the protection against dissemination nor the licensing of data as an alternative to the submittal of invention disclosures which include data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause.

        (4)  (i) SPP, ACT and User Facility Agreements (UFAs) may be available for use by the Contractor in addition to CRADAs. The Contractor agrees to inform prospective CRADA participants, which are intending to substantially pay full cost recovery for the effort under a proposed CRADA, of the availability of alternative forms of agreements,  SPP, ACT and UFA, and of the Class Patent Waiver provisions associated therewith.

        (ii) Where the Contractor believes that the transfer of technology to the U.S. domestic economy will benefit from, or other equity considerations dictate, an arrangement other than the Class Waiver of patent rights to the sponsor in SPP, ACT and UFAs, a request may be made to the contracting officer for an exception to the Class Waivers.

        (iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of rights contained in this Contract. Disposition of rights under any such agreement shall be in accordance with any DOE class waiver (including SPP, ACT and User Class Waivers) or individually negotiated waiver which applies to the agreement.

        (5)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(iii) of this clause, the Contractor shall assure that no employee of the Contractor shall have a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the negotiation, approval or performance of a CRADA, if, to such employee's knowledge:

        (A) Such employee, or the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or partner of such employee, or an organization (other than the Contractor) in which such employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee—

        () Holds financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA; or

        () Receives a gift or gratuity from any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA; or

        (B) A financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA, is held by any person or organization with whom such employee is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment.

        (ii) The Contractor shall require that each employee of the Contractor who has a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the negotiation, approval or performance of the CRADA certify through the Contractor to the contracting officer that the circumstances described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause do not apply to that employee.

        (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (n)(5)(i) and (ii) of this clause shall not apply in a case where the contracting officer is advised by the Contractor in advance of the participation of an employee described in those paragraphs of the nature of and extent of any financial interest described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause, and the contracting officer determines that such financial interest is not so substantial as to be considered likely to affect the integrity of the Contractor employee's participation in the process of negotiation, approval or performance of the CRADA.

        (o)  In conducting research and development activities in cost-shared agreements not covered by paragraph (n) of this clause, the Contractor, with prior written permission of the contracting officer, may provide for the withholding of data produced thereunder in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (n)(3) of this clause.

        (p)  (1) The Contractor agrees to establish a position to be known as “Technology Partnership Ombudsman,” to help resolve complaints from outside organizations regarding the policies and actions of the contractor with respect to technology partnerships (including CRADAs), patents owned by the contractor for inventions made at the laboratory, and technology licensing.

        (2) The Ombudsman shall be a senior official of the Contactor's laboratory staff, who is not involved in day-to-day technology partnerships, patents or technology licensing, or, if appointed from outside the laboratory or facility, shall function as such senior official.

        (3) The duties of the Technology Partnership Ombudsman shall include:

        (i) Serving as the focal point for assisting the public and industry in resolving complaints and disputes with the laboratory or facility regarding technology partnerships, patents, and technology licensing;

        (ii) Promoting the use of collaborative alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation to facilitate the speedy and low cost resolution of complaints and disputes, when appropriate; and

        (iii) Submitting a quarterly report, in a format provided by DOE, to the Director of the DOE Office of Dispute Resolution, and the Contracting Officer concerning the number and nature of complaints and disputes raised, along with the Ombudsman's assessment of their resolution, consistent with the protection of confidential and sensitive information.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 970.2770-4(b), add the following definition and new paragraph (q):

        means the prosecuting, maintaining, licensing, and marketing of inventions which are not owned by the Government (and not related to CRADAs) when such activities are conducted entirely without the use of Government funds.

        (q) Nothing in paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this clause are intended to apply to the contractor's privately funded technology transfer activities if such privately funded activities are addressed elsewhere in the contract.

        (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.2770-4(c), the contracting officer shall substitute the phrase “weapon production facility” wherever the word “laboratory” appears in the clause.

        (iv) DOE reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to modify, by deletion or insertion, technical fields, tasks, or other classifications for the purpose of determining DOE exceptional circumstance subject inventions.

        (4)  The Contractor may request rights greater than allowed by the exceptional circumstance determination in an exceptional circumstance subject invention by submitting such a request in writing to Patent Counsel at the time the exceptional circumstance subject invention is disclosed to DOE or within eight (8) months after conception or first actual reduction to practice of the exceptional circumstance subject invention, whichever occurs first, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Patent Counsel for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. DOE may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor.

        (5)  If the Contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention or does not request greater rights in an exceptional circumstance subject invention, a Contractor employee-inventor, after consultation with the Contractor and with written authorization from the Contractor in accordance with 10 CFR 784.9(b)(4), may request greater rights, including title, in the subject invention or the exceptional circumstance invention from DOE, and DOE may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor employee-inventor.

        (6)  If a Government employee is a joint inventor of a subject invention or of an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor has rights, the Government may assign or refuse to assign to the Contractor any rights in the subject invention or exceptional circumstance subject invention acquired by the Government from the Government employee, in accordance with 48 CFR 27.304-1(d). The rights assigned to the Contractor are subject to any provision of this clause that is applicable to subject inventions in which the Contractor retains title, including reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license, except that the Contractor shall file its initial patent application claiming the subject invention or exceptional circumstance invention within one (1) year after the assignment of such rights. The Contractor shall share royalties collected for the manufacture, use or sale of the subject invention with the Government employee.

        (c) —(1)  The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written or electronic report and shall identify the contract or any other agreement under which the invention was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by Budget and Resources (B&R) code for the invention. The funding program may require other invention identifiers such as related award numbers or funding opportunity announcement numbers. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted or made available for publication at the time of disclosure. The disclosure shall identify if the invention falls within an exceptional circumstance field. DOE will make a determination and advise the Contractor within 30 days of receipt of an invention disclosure as to whether the invention is an exceptional circumstance subject invention. In addition, after disclosure to the Patent Counsel, the Contractor will notify the agency of any accepted manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor that is 60 days prior to the end of the Statutory Period. The Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning any nonelectable subject invention such as an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement.

        (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.

        (3)  The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding first filed patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

        (4)  Requests for an extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of Patent Counsel, be granted.

        (5)  During the course of the work under this contract, the Contractor may desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract. Contractor's Invention Identification Procedures under paragraph (f)(5) of this clause should address timely disclosure of inventions, consider whether review is required, and if so, facilitate such review by Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters prior to disclosure of publications in order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor.

        (6)  Whenever possible in this paragraph (c), the Government electronic reporting system ( iEdison or similar system) shall be used for reporting and approvals.

        (d)  The Contractor will convey to the DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention—

        (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title.

        (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c), but prior to its receipt of the written request of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.

        (3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

        (4) If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention to which the Contractor had initially retained title or rights, or in an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor was granted greater rights, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion.

        (5) Upon a breach of paragraph (t) of this clause.

        (e) —(1)  The Contractor may request the right to reserve a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

        (2)  The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781. This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.

        (3)  Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

        (f) —(1)  The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed, and promptly deliver to the Patent Counsel all instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions:

        (i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title; and

        (ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (b) or (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.

        (2)  The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject invention made under this contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.

        (3)  The contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to file a patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 60 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.

        (4)  The contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent applications and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the invention.”

        (5)  The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and timely disclosed and shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting Officer may evaluate and determine their effectiveness.

        (6)  If the Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel, upon request, the following information and documents:

        (i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English);

        (ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all Government rights in the subject invention; and

        (iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent claiming the subject invention.

        (7)  The Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to the confidentiality provision at 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 401.

        (g) —(1)  The Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract.

        (2)  Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.14 with Alternate I of 48 CFR 952.227-11, Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202 and paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. The subcontractor retains all rights provided for the contractor in the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.3(a) and 401.14. If the S&E DEC, or any other related DEC, is applicable (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause), the Contractor shall use Alternate II of DEAR 952.227-11, Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor.

        (3)  Except for the subcontracts described in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. For subcontracts subject to a patent waiver granted by DOE Patent Counsel, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause. For subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause which may require the use of Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-13 Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government.

        (4)  With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.

        (5)  If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such a refusal, including any relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter, and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

        (6)  Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.

        (7)  If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention.

        (h)  The Contractor agrees to submit to DOE on request, periodic reports, no more frequently than annually, on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. In addition, the Contractor shall provide data to DOE for the annual data call for the Department of Commerce report that includes the number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, licensing activity, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.

        (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

        (j)  The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right under 35 U.S.C. 203 and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself under applicable law stated above.

        (k)  If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—

        (1)  Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions of this clause as the Contractor.

        (2)  It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph (k)(2).

        (3)  To the extent that it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility.

        (l)  The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity.

        (m) —(1)  Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject inventions disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the specified period; and a list of subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during a specified period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the specified period.

        (2)  Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period under which a subject invention was reported, or a statement that no such subject inventions under subcontracts were reported during the contract performance period.

        (n) —(1)  Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, documents, and other supporting data of the Contractor, which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to determine Contractor compliance with any requirement of this clause.

        (2)  If the Contracting Officer is aware of an invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject invention, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the invention for a determination of ownership rights.

        (3)  Any examination of records under this paragraph is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.

        (4)  With respect to a subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for any patent application claiming the subject invention.

        (o)  In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the Contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or product manufactured at the facility.

        (1) To practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility; and

        (2) To transfer such license with the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents herein licensed.

        (p) —(1)  No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the _Atomic Energy_ Act of 1954, as amended, may be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.

        (2)  Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (p)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.

        (q) —(1)  The Contractor shall not file or cause to be filed an application or registration for a patent disclosing a subject invention related to classified subject matter in any country other than the United States without first obtaining the written approval of the Contracting Officer.

        (2)  If in accordance with this clause the Contractor files a patent application in the United States disclosing a subject invention that is classified for reasons of security, the Contractor shall observe all applicable security regulations covering the transmission of classified subject matter. If the Contractor transmits a patent application disclosing a classified subject invention to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Contractor shall submit a separate letter to the USPTO identifying the contract or contracts by agency and agreement number that require security classification markings to be placed on the patent application.

        (3)  The Contractor agrees to include the substance of this clause in subcontracts at any tier that cover or are likely to cover subject matter classified for reasons of security.

        (r)  Upon the written request of the Contracting Officer or Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to make reasonable efforts to support DOE in accomplishing patent-related functions for work arising out of the contract, including, but not limited to, the prosecution of patent applications, and the determination of questions of novelty, patentability, and inventorship.

        (s)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer prior to the placement of any person subject to 35 U.S.C. 212 in an area of technology or task (1) related to exceptional circumstance technology or (2) which is subject to treaties or international agreements as set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause or agreements other than funding agreements. The Contracting Officer may disapprove of any such placement.

        (t)  (1) Consistent with 48 CFR 970.5227-3(f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, for all subject inventions under the S&E DEC, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner,  alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)(1) and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.

        (2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:

        (i)  The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that:

        (A) The Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible; and

        (B) A waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.

        (ii)  If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer & Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.

        (iii) Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (t)(1) of this clause to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)(1) of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.

        (iv) For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.

        (u)  Patent Counsel may conduct an annual appraisal to evaluate the Contractor's effectiveness in identifying and protecting subject inventions in accordance with DOE policy.

        (v)  The contractor will protect all invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information from unauthorized access and disclosure using at least commonly available techniques and practices. In the event that the Contractor becomes aware of unauthorized access to invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel within 7 days.

        As prescribed at 970.2703-2(g), insert the following definition in paragraph (a) and add paragraph (b)(7), respectively:

        (a) — means any subject invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under work funded by or through defense programs, including Department of Defense and intelligence reimbursable work, or the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program of the Department of Energy or the National Nuclear Security Administration.

        (b) —(7)  Except to the extent that DOE is solely satisfied that the Contractor meets certain procedural requirements and DOE grants rights to the Contractor in weapons related subject inventions, the Contractor does not have the right to retain title to any weapons related subject inventions.

        (viii) The identification of any agreement relating to the subject invention, including Cooperative Research and Development Agreements and Strategic Partnership Projects agreements.

        Unless the Contractor contends otherwise in writing at the time the invention is disclosed, inventions disclosed to DOE under this paragraph are deemed made in the manner specified in sections (a)(1) and (2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908.

        (2)  After disclosure of the subject invention to the DOE, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance for publication of any manuscript describing the subject invention or of any expected or on sale or public use of the subject invention, known by the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement. Notwithstanding the above, inventions subject to the S&E DEC do not require approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information.

        (3)  If the Contractor has the right to elect to retain title to subject inventions under an advance class waiver granted in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, and unless otherwise provided for by the terms of the advance class waiver, the Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any subject invention by notifying DOE within two (2) years of the date of the disclosure of the subject invention to DOE, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The notification shall identify the advance class waiver, state the countries, including the United States, in which rights are retained, and certify that the subject invention is not an exceptional circumstance subject invention or subject to a treaty or international agreement. If a publication, on sale or public use of the subject invention has initiated the statutory period under 35 U.S.C. 102(b), the period for election may be shortened by DOE to a date that is no more than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the statutory period.

        (4)  If the Contractor has the right to retain title to a subject invention in accordance with an advance class waiver pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (b)(7) of this clause, and unless otherwise provided for by the terms of the advance class waiver or greater rights determination, the Contractor shall file an initial patent application claiming the subject invention to which it retains title either within one (1) year after the Contractor's election to retain or grant of title to the subject invention or prior to the end of any statutory period, whichever occurs first. Any patent applications filed by the Contractor in foreign countries or international patent offices shall be filed within either ten (10) months of the corresponding initial patent application or, if such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order, within six (6) months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications.

        (5)  If the Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel, upon request, the following information and documents:

        (i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English);

        (ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all Government rights in the subject invention; and

        (iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent claiming the subject invention.

        (7)  The Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 40.

        (8)  Whenever possible in this paragraph (c), the Government electronic reporting system ( iEdison or similar system) may be used for reporting and approvals.

        (d) —(1)  If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention, including an exceptional circumstance subject invention, to which the Contractor retained title or rights under paragraph (b)(2) or (7) of this clause, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion.

        (2)  Title vests in DOE and DOE may request, in writing, a formal assignment of title to a subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE, if the Contractor elects not to retain title to the subject invention under an advance class waiver, or the Contractor fails to disclose or fails to elect to retain title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (3) of this clause.

        (3)  In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this clause, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in any country after the times specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of DOE's written request for title, the Contractor continues to retain title in that country.

        (4)  If the Contractor decides to not file a non-provisional application, or to discontinue the prosecution of a patent application, the payment of maintenance fees, or the defense of a subject invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any country, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE.

        (5)  DOE may request, in writing, title to any subject inventions from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject inventions to DOE, if the advance class waiver granted under paragraph (b)(2) of this clause is terminated under paragraph (v) of this clause.

        (6) Upon a breach of paragraph (t) of this clause.

        (e) —(1)  Except for subject inventions that the Contractor fails to disclose within the time periods specified at paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, the Contractor may request a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country claiming a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, and DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. If DOE grants the Contractor's request for a license, the Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded.

        (2)  Contractor must obtain DOE approval of any transfer of the Contractor's license in a subject invention, and DOE may determine that the Contractor's license is non-transferrable, on a case-by-case basis.

        (3)  DOE may revoke or modify the Contractor's domestic license to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations. DOE may not revoke the Contractor's domestic license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor, its licensees or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. DOE may revoke or modify the Contractor's license in any foreign country to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.

        (4)  Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations.

        (f) —(1)  The Contractor agrees to execute or have executed, and to deliver promptly to DOE all instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions:

        (i) Establish or confirm the Government's rights throughout the world in subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title;

        (ii) Convey title in a subject invention to DOE pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) and paragraph (d) of this clause; or

        (iii) Enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in a subject invention to which the Government has title.

        (2)  The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject invention made under this contract, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications claiming subject inventions or to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format shall at a minimum include the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.

        (3)  The Contractor agrees to establish and maintain effective procedures for ensuring the prompt identification and timely disclosure of subject inventions to DOE. The Contractor shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting Officer, upon request, for evaluation and approval of the effectiveness of such procedures by the Contracting Officer.

        (4)  With respect to any subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel of any decision to discontinue the prosecution of a patent application, payment of maintenance fees, or defense of a subject invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any country, not less than 60 days before the expiration of the response period for any action required by the corresponding patent office.

        (5)  With respect to any subject invention to which the Contractor has title, the Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and within any patent issuing thereon claiming a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.”

        (6)  If the Contractor licenses a subject invention, the Contractor agrees to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the subject invention to any party.

        (7)  Rights in a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor without the approval of DOE.

        (8)  The Contractor shall make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and may give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision as to whether to give a preference in any specific case is at the discretion of the Contractor.

        (9)  To the extent that it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility.

        (g) —(1)  The Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract.

        (2)  Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.14, with Alternate I of 48 CFR 952.227-11 Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202 and paragraph (b)(6) of this clause. If the S&E DEC, or any related DEC, is applicable (see paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this clause), the Contractor shall use Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-11 Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor.

        (3)  Except for the subcontracts described in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties and any applicable patent waiver granted by DOE Patent Counsel, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. If the S&E DEC, or any related DEC, is applicable (see paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this clause), the Contractor shall use Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-13 Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government.

        (4)  With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.

        (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent rights clause. If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and including relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter; and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

        (6)  Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.

        (7)  If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention, with a copy of the notification and identification to the Contracting Officer.

        (h)  Upon request by DOE, the Contractor agrees to submit periodic reports, no more frequently than annually, describing the utilization of a subject invention or efforts made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees to obtain utilization of the subject invention. In addition, the Contractor shall provide data to DOE for the annual data call for the Department of Commerce report that included the number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, licensing activity, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and other data and information reasonably specified by DOE. Upon request by DOE, the Contractor also agrees to provide reports in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by DOE, in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. If any data or information reported by the Contractor in accordance with this provision is considered privileged and confidential by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee and the Contractor properly marks the data or information privileged or confidential, DOE agrees not to disclose such information to persons outside the Government, to the extent permitted by law.

        (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause the Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it retains title, neither it nor any assignee may grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, DOE may waive the requirement for such an agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

        (j)  With respect to any subject invention to which the Contractor has elected to retain or is granted title, DOE may, in accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations, require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself under the patent waiver.

        (k)  The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure, or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel identified in the contract.

        (l) —(1)  Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject inventions disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the specified period; and/or a list of subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during a specified period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the specified period. The interim report shall state whether the Contractor's invention disclosures were submitted to DOE in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this clause.

        (2)  Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract or within three (3) months of the date of completion of the contracted work, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and/or a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the contract performance period.

        (m)  In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or products manufactured at the facility:

        (1) To practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility; and

        (2) To transfer such license with the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents herein licensed.

        (n) —(1)  No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, may be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.

        (2)  Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (o)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.

        (o) —(1)  The Contractor shall not file or cause to be filed an application or registration for a patent disclosing a subject invention related to classified subject matter in any country other than the United States without first obtaining the written approval of the Contracting Officer.

        (2)  If in accordance with this clause the Contractor files a patent application in the United States disclosing a subject invention that is classified for reasons of security, the Contractor shall observe all applicable security regulations covering the transmission of classified subject matter. If the Contractor transmits a patent application disclosing a classified subject invention to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Contractor shall submit a separate letter to the USPTO identifying the contract or contracts by agency and agreement number that require security classification markings to be placed on the patent application.

        (3)  The Contractor agrees to include the substance of this clause in subcontracts at any tier that cover or are likely to cover subject matter classified for reasons of security.

        (p) —(1)  Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents and other supporting data of the Contractor, which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to determine Contractor (and inventor) compliance with the requirements of this clause, including proper identification and disclosure of subject inventions, and establishment and maintenance of invention disclosure procedures.

        (2)  If the Contracting Officer is aware of an invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject invention, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the invention for a determination of ownership rights.

        (3)  Any examination of records under this paragraph is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.

        (4)  With respect to a subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for any patent application claiming the subject invention.

        (q)  Upon the written request of the Contracting Officer or Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to make reasonable efforts to support DOE in accomplishing patent-related functions for work arising out of the contract, including, but not limited to, the prosecution of patent applications, and the determination of questions of novelty, patentability, and inventorship.

        (r)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer prior to the placement of any person subject to 35 U.S.C. 212 in an area of technology or task:

        (1) Related to exceptional circumstance technology; or

        (2) Any person who is subject to treaties or international agreements as set forth in paragraph (b)(6) of this clause or to agreements other than funding agreements. The Contracting Officer may disapprove of any such placement.

        (s)  Patent Counsel may conduct an annual appraisal to evaluate the Contractor's effectiveness in identifying and protecting subject inventions in accordance with DOE policy.

        (t)  (1) Consistent with 48 CFR 970.5227-3(f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, for all subject inventions under the S&E DEC, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner,  alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contactor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)(1) and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.

        (2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:

        (i)  The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that (A) the Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (B) a waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.

        (ii)  If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer & Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.

        (iii)  Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (t)(1) of this clause to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)(1) of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.

        (iv)  For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.

        (u)  The Contractor shall receive approval from Patent Counsel prior to releasing or publishing information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, to ensure such release or publication does not adversely affect the patent rights of DOE or the Contractor. At the discretion of the Patent Counsel, authority to review publications prior to release may be delegated to the Contractor.

        (v)  If a request by the Contractor for an advance class waiver pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause contains false material statements or fails to disclose material facts, and DOE relies on the false statements or omissions in granting the Contractor's request, the waiver or grant of any Government rights (in whole or in part) to the subject invention(s) may be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy or designee. Prior to termination, DOE shall provide the Contractor with written notification of the termination, including a statement of facts in support of the termination, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days, or a longer period authorized by the Secretary of Energy or designee for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor, to show cause for not terminating the waiver or grant. Any termination of an advance class waiver or a determination of greater rights is subject to the Contractor's license as provided for in paragraph (f) of this clause.

        (w)  The contractor will protect all invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information from unauthorized access and disclosure using at least commonly available techniques and practices. In the event that the Contractor becomes aware of unauthorized access to invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel within 7 days.

        As prescribed at 970.2703-2(g), insert the following definition in paragraph (a) and add paragraph (b)(10) respectively:

        (a) — means any subject invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under work funded by or through defense programs, including Department of Defense and intelligence reimbursable work, or the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program of the Department of Energy or the National Nuclear Security Administration.

        (b)  (10)  Except to the extent that DOE is solely satisfied that the Contractor meets certain procedural requirements and DOE grants rights to the Contractor in weapons related subject inventions, the Contractor does not have a right to retain title to any weapons related subject inventions.

#### § 970.5232-2

        As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1), insert the following clause:

        (a)  The fixed-fee payable, if applicable, under this contract shall become due and payable in periodic installments in accordance with a schedule determined by the Contracting Officer. Fixed-fee payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No fixed-fee payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

        (b)  The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall agree as to the extent to which payment for allowable costs or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer (for example, negotiated fixed amounts) shall be made from advances of Government funds.

        (c)  Funds for payments of allowable costs, including payments for pension plan contributions, shall be drawn from the special financial institution account when those payments are made, not when the costs are accrued.

        (d)  All advances of Government funds shall be withdrawn pursuant to a payments cleared financing arrangement prescribed by DOE in favor of the financial institution or, at the option of the Government, shall be made by direct payment or other payment mechanism to the Contractor, and shall be deposited only in the special financial institution account referred to in the Special Financial Institution Account Agreement, which is incorporated into this contract as Appendix—“___”. The contractor will follow current procedures and requirements for establishing and managing the special financial institution account that are stated in the Department's Financial Management Handbook and relevant Department of Treasury rules.

        (e)  Government funds in the special financial institution account shall be used only for costs allowable and, if applicable, fees earned under this contract, negotiated fixed amounts, or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.

        (f)  Title to the unexpended balance of any funds advanced and of any special financial institution account established pursuant to this clause shall remain in the Government and be superior to any claim or lien of the financial institution of deposit or others. It is understood that an advance to the Contractor hereunder is not a loan to the Contractor and will not require the payment of interest by the Contractor, and that the Contractor acquires no right, title or interest in or to such advance other than the right to make expenditures therefrom, as provided in this clause.

        (g)  The Government shall promptly pay to the Contractor the unpaid balance of allowable costs (or other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) and fee upon termination of the work, expiration of the term of the contract, or completion of the work and its acceptance by the Government after—

        (1) Compliance by the Contractor with DOE's patent clearance requirements; and

        (2) The furnishing by the Contractor of—

        (i) An assignment of the Contractor's rights to any refunds, rebates, allowances, accounts receivable, collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, or other credits applicable to allowable costs under the contract;

        (ii) A closing financial statement;

        (iii) The accounting for Government-owned property required by the clause entitled “Property”; and

        (iv) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract subject only to the following exceptions—

        (A) Specified claims in stated amounts or in estimated amounts where the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor;

        (B) Claims, together with reasonable expenses incidental thereto, based upon liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of the performance of this contract; provided that such claims are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release; and provided further that the Contractor gives notice of such claims in writing to the Contracting Officer promptly, but not more than one (1) year after the Contractor's right of action first accrues. In addition, the Contractor shall provide prompt notice to the Contracting Officer of all potential claims under this clause, whether in litigation or not (see Contract Clause, 48 CFR 970.5228-1, Insurance—Litigation and Claims);

        (C) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of any indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable expenses incidental thereto, incurred by the Contractor under the provisions of this contract relating to patents; and

        (D) Claims recognizable under the clause entitled, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.

        (3) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted—

        (i) Any claim which the Government may have against the Contractor in connection with this contract; and

        (ii) Deductions due under the terms of this contract and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the Government. The unliquidated balance of the special financial institution account may be applied to the amount due, and any balance shall be returned to the Government forthwith.

        (h)  Claims for credit against funds advanced for payment shall be accompanied by such supporting documents and justification as the Contracting Officer shall prescribe.

        (i)  The Contractor shall take and afford the Government the advantage of all known and available cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, and commissions unless the Contracting Officer finds that action is not in the best interest of the Government.

        (j)  All collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, except for the Contractor's fee and royalties or other income accruing to the Contractor from technology transfer activities in accordance with this contract, shall be Government property and shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and, to the extent consistent with those requirements, shall be deposited in the special financial institution account or otherwise made available for payment of allowable costs under this contract, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.

        (k)  The Government reserves the right, upon ten days written notice from the Contracting Officer to the Contractor, to pay directly to the persons concerned, all amounts due which otherwise would be allowable under this contract. Any payment so made shall discharge the Government of all liability to the Contractor.

        (l)  Regardless of contractor type, the Contracting Officer shall determine allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 31.2 and the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation subpart 48 CFR 970.31 in effect on the date of this contract and other provisions of this contract.

        (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(i), if a separate fixed-fee is provided for a separate item of work, paragraph (a) of the basic clause should be modified to permit payment of the entire fixed-fee upon completion of that item.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(ii), when total available fee provisions are used, replace paragraph (a) of the basic clause with the following paragraph (a):

        (a)  (1) The base fee amount, if any, is payable in equal monthly installments. Total available fee amount earned is payable following the Government's Determination of Total Available Fee Amount Earned in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount.” Base fee amount and total available fee amount earned payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No base fee amount or total available fee amount earned payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without the prior written approval of the contracting officer.

        (2)  Additionally, if the Contracting Officer authorizes provisional payment of fee and for only as long as the Contracting Officer authorizes it, the Contractor may withdraw from funds advanced on the last working day of each month a provisional fee equal to 6 percent of the annual total available fee amount. The Contracting Officer may for any reason withdraw his/her authorization allowing the Contractor's withdrawal of provisional fee if at any time in his/her judgement the Contractor will not earn the provisional fee. The Contracting Officer's decision to authorize the Contractor's withdrawal of provisional fee or to withdraw such authorization is solely within the Contracting Officer's discretion. Following the Government's determination of total available fee amount earned, the Contractor may withdraw from funds advanced the amount by which earned fee exceeds provisional fee; and must immediately return to funds advanced the amount by which provisional fee exceeds earned fee.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(iii), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and operating contracts with integrated accounting systems:

        (k)  The Contractor shall prepare and submit annually as of September 30, a “Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed” (Cost Statement) for the total of net expenditures accrued ( net costs incurred) for the period covered by the Cost Statement. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 308), as amended, and the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3279, ). DOE, after audit and appropriate adjustment, will approve such Cost Statement. This approval by DOE will constitute an acknowledgment by DOE that the net costs incurred are allowable under the contract and that they have been recorded in the accounts maintained by the Contractor in accordance with DOE accounting policies, but will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for DOE's assets in its care, for appropriate subsequent adjustments, or for errors later becoming known to DOE.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(iv), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and operating contracts without integrated accounting systems:

        (k)  The Contractor shall prepare and submit a “Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed” (Cost Statement) for the total of net expenditures incurred for the period covered by the Cost Statement. It is anticipated that this will be an annual submission unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 308), as amended.

        (c)  Except as otherwise provided by the Contracting Officer, title to all materials, equipment, supplies, and tangible personal property of every kind and description purchased by the Contractor, for the cost of which the Contractor is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract, shall pass directly from the vendor to the Government. The Government reserves the right to inspect, and to accept or reject, any item of such property. The Contractor shall make such disposition of rejected items as the Contracting Officer shall direct. Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to the Contractor under this contract, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon:

        (1) Issuance for use of such property in the performance of this contract; or

        (2) Commencement of processing or use of such property in the performance of this contract; or

        (3) Reimbursement of the cost thereof by the Government, whichever first occurs. Property furnished by the Government and property purchased or furnished by the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government, under this paragraph are hereinafter referred to as Government property. Title to Government property shall not be affected by the incorporation of the property into or the attachment of it to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall such Government property or any part thereof, be or become a fixture or lose its identity as personal property by reason of affixation to any realty.

        (d)  To the extent directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall identify Government property coming into the Contractor's possession or custody, by marking and segregating in such a way, satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, as shall indicate its ownership by the Government.

        (e)  The Contractor shall make such disposition of Government property which has come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract as the Contracting Officer may direct during the progress of the work or upon completion or termination of this contract. The Contractor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Contracting Officer may approve, sell, or exchange such property, or acquire such property at a price agreed upon by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor as the fair value thereof. The amount received by the Contractor as the result of any disposition, or the agreed fair value of any such property acquired by the Contractor, shall be applied in reduction of costs allowable under this contract or shall be otherwise credited to account to the Government, as the Contracting Officer may direct. Upon completion of the work or the termination of this contract, the Contractor shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the Contracting Officer, of all government property which had come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract.

        (f)  (1) The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions, and such other actions as may be directed by the Contracting Officer, or in the absence of such direction, in accordance with sound business practice, to safeguard and protect government property in the Contractor's possession or custody.

        (2) In addition, the Contractor shall ensure that adequate safeguards are in place, and adhered to, for the handling, control and disposition of high-risk property and classified materials throughout the life cycle of the property and materials consistent with the policies, practices and procedures for property management contained in the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 101), the Department of Energy (DOE) Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 109), and other applicable Regulations.

        (3) High-risk property is property, the loss, destruction, damage to, or the unintended or premature transfer of which could pose risks to the public, the environment, or the national security interests of the United States. High-risk property includes proliferation sensitive, nuclear related dual use, export controlled, chemically or radioactively contaminated, hazardous, and specially designed and prepared property, including property on the militarily critical technologies list.

        (g)  (1)(i) The Contractor shall not be liable for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property unless such loss, destruction, or damage was caused by any of the following—

        (A) Willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel;

        (B) Failure of the Contractor's managerial personnel to take all reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate written direction of the Contracting Officer to safeguard such property and classified materials; or

        (C) Failure of contractor managerial personnel to establish, administer, or properly maintain an approved property management system in accordance with 41 CFR chapter 109.

        (ii) If, after an initial review of the facts, the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that there is reason to believe that the loss, destruction of, or damage to the government property results from conduct falling within one of the categories set forth above, the burden of proof shall be upon the Contractor to show that the Contractor should not be required to compensate the government for the loss, destruction, or damage.

        (2) In the event that the Contractor is determined liable for the loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with this clause, the Contractor's compensation to the Government shall be determined as follows:

        (i) For damaged property, the compensation shall be the cost of repairing such damaged property, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement of the damaged property. However, the value of repair costs shall not exceed the fair market value of the damaged property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.

        (ii) For destroyed or lost property, the compensation shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such loss or destruction, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement and costs associated with the disposition of destroyed property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.

        (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the Contractor that is allocable to coverage of risks of loss referred to in this clause is not allowable.

        (h)  In the event of any damage, destruction, or loss to Government property in the possession or custody of the Contractor with a value above the threshold set out in the Contractor's approved property management system, the Contractor—

        (1) Shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the occasion and extent thereof;

        (2) Shall take all reasonable steps to protect the property remaining; and

        (3) Shall repair or replace the damaged, destroyed, or lost property in accordance with the written direction of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall take no action prejudicial to the right of the Government to recover therefore, and shall furnish to the Government, on request, all reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery.

        (i)  Government property shall be used only for the performance of this contract.

        (j) —(1)  (i) The Contractor shall establish, administer, and properly maintain an approved property management system of accounting for and control, utilization, maintenance, repair, protection, preservation, and disposition of Government property in its possession under the contract. The Contractor's property management system shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval and shall be maintained and administered in accordance with sound business practice, applicable Federal _Property Management_ Regulations and Department of Energy Property Management Regulations, and such directives or instructions which the Contracting Officer may from time to time prescribe.

        (ii) In order for a property management system to be approved, it must provide for—

        (A) Comprehensive coverage of property from the requirement identification, through its life cycle, to final disposition;

        (B) [Reserved]

        (C) Full integration with the Contractor's other administrative and financial systems; and

        (D) A method for continuously improving property management practices through the identification of best practices established by “best in class” performers.

        (iii) Approval of the Contractor's property management system shall be contingent upon the completion of the baseline inventory as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this clause.

        (2)  (i) Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall within six months after execution of the contract provide a baseline inventory covering all items of Government property.

        (ii) If the Contractor is succeeding another contractor in the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall conduct a joint reconciliation of the property inventory with the predecessor contractor. The Contractor agrees to participate in a joint reconciliation of the property inventory at the completion of this contract. This information will be used to provide a baseline for the succeeding contract as well as information for closeout of the predecessor contract.

        (k) The term “contractor's managerial personnel” as used in this clause means the Contractor's directors, officers and any of its managers, superintendents, or other equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of—

        (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business; or

        (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any one facility or separate location to which this contract is being performed; or

        (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the performance of this contract; or

        (4) A separate and complete major construction, alteration, or repair operation in connection with performance of this contract; or

        (5) A separate and discrete major task or operation in connection with the performance of this contract.

        (l) The Contractor shall include this clause in all cost reimbursable subcontracts.

        [December 2024]. As prescribed in 970.4501-2, when the award is to a nonprofit contractor, replace paragraph (k) of the basic clause with the following paragraph (k):

        (k) The term “contractor's managerial personnel” as used in this clause means the Contractor's directors, officers and any of its managers, superintendents, or other equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of—

        (1) The Contractor's business; or
