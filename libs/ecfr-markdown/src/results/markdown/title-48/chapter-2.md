        201.170   Peer reviews.

#### § 201.170

        (a)  (1) The Office of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (DPCAP), using the procedures at PGI 201.170, will organize teams of reviewers and facilitate peer reviews for solicitations and contracts as follows:

        (i) DPCAP will conduct the preaward peer reviews for competitive procurements prior to the three phases of the acquisition (see PGI 201.170-2(a)) for all procurements with an estimated value of $1 billion or more under major defense acquisition programs for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) is the milestone decision authority or USD(A&S) designates as requiring a peer review regardless of value. DoD components may request DPCAP-led peer reviews for acquisitions valued below the $1 billion threshold. DPCAP will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Director, DPCAP (Contract Policy).

        (ii) DPCAP will conduct the preaward peer reviews for noncompetitive procurements prior to the two phases of the acquisition (see PGI 201.170-2(b)) for contract actions,  new contracts, modifications to existing contracts, requests for equitable adjustment, claims valued at $1 billion or more, or for any other contract action USD(A&S) designates as requiring a peer review regardless of value. DoD components may request DPCAP-led peer reviews for contract actions valued below the $1 billion threshold. DPCAP will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Director, DPCAP (Price, Cost and Finance).

        (iii) Use the following criteria to identify actions that are subject to peer review (see also FAR 1.108(c), Dollar thresholds):

        (A) If the not-to-exceed amount for an undefinitized contract action or an unpriced change order exceeds the peer review threshold, then the resultant definitization modification(s) will be subject to peer review regardless of actual performance up to the point of definitization.

        (B) For indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts that will establish pricing terms that apply to orders, use the total maximum dollar value for purposes of the peer review threshold. IDIQ contracts that will not establish pricing terms in the basic contract are not subject to peer review, but individual orders that exceed the threshold are subject to peer review.

        (C) For noncompetitive contract actions, use the greater of the following when considering the firm requirement for all supplies or services:

        () The approved Government objective amount.

        () The contractor proposed amount.

        (2) To facilitate planning for peer reviews, the military departments and defense agencies shall provide a rolling annual forecast of acquisitions that will be subject to DPCAP peer reviews at the end of each quarter ( March 31; June 30; September 30; December 31).

        (i) Military departments and defense agencies shall submit quarterly forecasts for competitive peer reviews to the Director, DPCAP (Contract Policy), at

        (ii) Military departments and defense agencies shall submit quarterly forecasts for noncompetitive peer reviews to the Director, DPCAP (Price, Cost and Finance), at

        (b)  The military departments and defense agencies shall establish procedures for—

        (1) Preaward peer reviews of solicitations for competitive procurements not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and

        (2) Preaward peer reviews of noncompetitive procurements not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

      Subpart 201.3—Agency Acquisition Regulations

        201.301   Policy.

#### § 201.301

        (a)(1) DoD implementation and supplementation of the FAR is issued in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) under authorization and subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. The DFARS contains—

        (i) Requirements of law;

        (ii) DoD-wide policies;

        (iii) Delegations of FAR authorities;

        (iv) Deviations from FAR requirements; and

        201.303   Publication and codification.

#### § 201.303

        (a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.

        (ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR counterpart.

        (A) Implemental number_i_ng is the same as its FAR counterpart, except when the text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR _1_.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example, three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501 (1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a) (i), (ii), and (iii) rather than (a) (1), (2), and (3). Further subdivision of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 219.501(1)(i)(A)()().

        (B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70 (a), (b), and (c).

        (C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.

        (D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.

        (iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract ( a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.

        (1) Solicits and receives offers from both small and other than small business concerns;

        (2) Establishes a tiered or cascading order of precedence for evaluating offers that is specified in the solicitation; and

        (3) If no award can be made at the first tier, evaluates offers at the next lower tier, until award can be made.

        203.906   Remedies.

#### § 203.906

        (1) Not later than 30 days after receiving a DoD Inspector General report in accordance with 203.905, the head of the agency shall determine whether sufficient basis exists to conclude that the contractor has subjected the complainant to a reprisal as prohibited by 203.903 and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:

        (i) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.

        (ii) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.

        (iii) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the agency.

        (2) If the head of the agency issues an order denying relief or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of the complaint or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension of time granted in accordance with 203.905(3)(ii), and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant—

        (i) The complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint; and

        (ii) The complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under 10 U.S.C. 4701 in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than 2years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.

        (3) An Inspector General determination and an agency head order denying relief under paragraph (2) of this section shall be admissible in evidence in any de novo action at law or equity brought pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 4701(c).

        (4) Whenever a contractor fails to comply with an order issued by the head of agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701, the head of the agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.

        (5) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701 may obtain judicial review of the order's conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to Chapter 7 of Title 5, Unites States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.

        (6) The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.

Copies of the General Records Schedule may be obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408.

        (2) Deviations from the periods cannot be granted by the Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council. Forward requests for deviations to both the Government Accountability Office and the National Archives and Records Administration.

        (3) Hold completed contract files in the office responsible for maintaining them for a period of 12 months after completion. After the initial 12 month period, send the records to the local records holding or staging area until they are eligible for destruction. If no space is available locally, transfer the files to the General Services Administration Federal Records Center that services the area.

        (4) Duplicate or working contract files should contain no originals of materials that properly belong in the official files. Destroy working files as soon as practicable once they are no longer needed.

        (5) Retain pricing review files, containing documents related to reviews of the contractor's price proposals, subject to certified cost or pricing data (see FAR 15.403-4), for six years.

        See PGI 204.1103 for helpful information on navigation and data entry in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.

        (1) On contract award documents, use the contractor's legal or “doing business as” name and physical address information as recorded in the SAM database at the time of award.

        (2) When making a determination to exercise an option, or at any other time before issuing a modification other than a unilateral modification making an administrative change, ensure that—

        (i) The contractor's record is active in the SAM database; and

        (ii) The contractor's unique entity identifier (UEI) number, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, name, and physical address are accurately reflected in the contract document.

        (3) At any time, if the UEI number, CAGE code, contractor name, or physical address on a contract no longer matches the information on the contractor's record in the SAM database, the contracting officer shall process a novation or change-of-name agreement, or an address change, as appropriate.

        (4) See PGI 204.1103 for additional requirements relating to use of information in the SAM database.

        (5) On contractual documents transmitted to the payment office, provide the CAGE code, instead of the UEI, in accordance with agency procedures.

      Subpart 204.16—Uniform Procurement Instrument Identifiers

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 9785, Feb. 26, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

        204.1601   Policy.

#### § 204.1601

        (a)  Do not reuse a PIID once it has been assigned. Do not assign the same PIID to more than one task or delivery order, even if they are issued under different base contracts or agreements.

        (b)  Effective October 1, 2016, all DoD components shall comply with the PIID numbering requirements of FAR subpart 4.16 and this subpart for all new solicitations, contracts, orders, and agreements issued, and any amendments and modifications to those new actions. See also PGI 204.1601(b).

        (c)  When a PIID is changed after contract award, the new PIID is known as a continued contract.

        (i) A continued contract—

        (A) Does not constitute a new procurement;

        (B) Incorporates all prices, terms, and conditions of the predecessor contract effective at the time of issuance of the continued contract;

        (C) Operates as a separate contract independent of the predecessor contract once issued; and

        (D) Shall not be used to evade competition requirements, expand the scope of work, or extend the period of performance beyond that of the predecessor contract.

        (ii) When issuing a continued contract, the contracting officer shall—

        (A) Issue an administrative modification to the predecessor contract to clearly state that—

        () Any future awards provided for under the terms of the predecessor contract ( issuance of orders or exercise of options) will be accomplished under the continued contract; and

        () Supplies and services already acquired under the predecessor contract shall remain solely under that contract for purposes of Government inspection, acceptance, payment, and closeout; and

        (B) Follow the procedures at PGI 204.1601(c).

        204.1603   Procedures.

#### § 204.1603

        (a)  DoD-issued PIIDs are thirteen characters in length. Use only alpha-numeric characters, as prescribed in FAR 4.1603 and this subpart. Do not use the letter I or O in any part of the PIID.

        (3)

        (A) DoD will use three of the letters reserved for departmental or agency use in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) in this position as follows:

        () Use M to identify purchase orders and task or delivery orders issued by the enterprise FedMall system.

        () Use S to identify broad agency announcements and commercial solutions openings.

        () Use T to identify automated requests for quotations by authorized legacy contract writing systems. See PGI 204.160__3__(a)(3)(A)() for the list of authorized systems.

        (B) Do not use other letters identified in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) as “Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide use” or “Reserved for departmental or agency use” in position 9 of the PIID.

        (C) Do not use the letter C or H for contracts or agreements with provisions for orders or calls.

        (4)  In accordance with FAR 4.1603(a)(4), DoD-issued PIIDs shall only use positions 10 through 13 to complete the PIID. Enter the serial number of the instrument in these positions. A separate series of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in FAR 4.1603(a)(3). DoD components assign such series of PIID numbers sequentially. A DoD component may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various activities.  Use C in position 10 to identify the solicitation as a commercial solutions opening.

        (b)  In addition to the supplementary PIID numbering procedures in FAR 4._1_603(b), follow the procedures contained in paragraphs (b)(_2_)(ii)() and () of this section. See PGI 204.1603(b) for examples of proper supplementary PIID numbering.

        (2)(ii)  In accordance with FAR 4.1603(b)(2)(ii), DoD-issued supplementary PIIDs shall, for positions 2 through 6 of modifications to contracts and agreements, comply with the following:

        ()  These two digits may be either alpha or numeric characters, except—

        () Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q only _i_n position 2, and only if the modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order;

        () Use S only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—

        () The contr_a_ct has either FOB origin or destination delivery terms; and

        () The price changes;

        () Use T, U, V, W, X, or Y only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—

        () The contr_a_ct has FOB origin delivery terms; and

        () The price does not change; and

        () Use Z only in position 2, and only to identify a modification which definitizes a letter contract or a previously issued undefinitized modification.

        ()  These positions are always numeric. Use a separate series of serial numbers for each type of modification listed in paragraph (b)(_2_)(ii) of this section.

#### § 204.1671

        (a) Circumstances may exist in which the numeric order of the modifications to a contract is not the order in which the changes to the contract actually take effect.

        (b) In order to determine the sequence of modifications to a contract or order, the modifications will be applied in the following order—

        (1) Modifications will be applied in order of the effective date on the modification;

        (2) In the event of two or more modifications with the same effective date, modifications will be applied in signature date order; and

        (3) In the event of two or more modifications with the same effective date and the same signature date, procuring contracting office modifications will be applied in numeric order, followed by contract administration office modifications in numeric order.

        204.7103-1   Criteria for establishing.

#### § 204.7103-1

        Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.

        (a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be missing—

        (1)  The item shall have a single unit price or a single total price, except—

        (i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP instead of the unit price;

        (ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in accordance with 204.7104;

        (iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;

        (iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item;

        (v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or

        (vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.

        (2)  A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the contract.

        (i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—

        (A) National stock number (NSN);

        (B) Item description; or

        (C) Manufacturer's part number.

        (ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—

        (A) Scope of work; or

        (B) Description of services.

        (iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items include the actual detailed identification in accordance with 204.7104. Where this exception applies, use a general narrative description instead of the contract item description.

        (3)  Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).

        (i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.

        (ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the delivery schedule.

        (4)  (i) Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.

        (ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following situations:

        (A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years in accordance with DoD policy;

        (B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce items being acquired by several activities; or

        (C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with different accounting classification citations.

        (iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance with 204.7104-1(a).

        (b) All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line item shall be the same contract type as the contract line item.

        (c) For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or cost-reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, to facilitate appropriate payment.

        (d) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105.

        (e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.

        (f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.

        (g) Certain commercial products and initial provisioning spares for weapons systems are requested and subsequently solicited using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot. However, there are times when individual items within that kit, set, or lot are not grouped and delivered in a single shipment. This creates potential contract administration issues with inspection, acceptance, and payment. In such cases, solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to provide information about products that may not have been known to the Government prior to solicitation and propose an alternate line item structure as long as the alternate is consistent with the requirements of 204.71, which provides explicit guidance on the use of contract line items and subline items, and with PGI 204.71.

        204.7104   Contract subline items.

#### § 204.7104

        204.7104-1   Criteria for establishing.

#### § 204.7104-1

        Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.

        (a)  (1) This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.

        (2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements. However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance. Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.

        (3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-1(a)(4)(ii)).

        (b)  (1) Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes. Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item number—

        (i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify the funding as described in 204.7104-1(a)(3);

        (ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;

        (iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;

        (iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or

        (v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—

        (A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and

        (B) Are separately priced.

        (2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—

        (i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;

        (ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). This requirement does not apply—

        (A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment. If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or

        (B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 204.7103-1(a)(1)(vi).

        (iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's part number, scope of work, description of services).

        (3) Unit prices and extended amounts.

        (i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.

        (ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.

        (iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section shall not be combined in a contract line item.

        (iv) When the price for items not separately priced is included in the price of another contract line or subline item, it may be necessary to withhold payment on the priced contract line or subline item until the included line or subline items that are not separately priced have been delivered. See the clause at 252.204-7002, Payment for Contract Line or Subline Items Not Separately Priced.

        204.7106   Contract modifications.

#### § 204.7106

        (a) If new items are added, assign new contract line or subline item numbers or exhibit line item numbers, in accordance with the procedures established at 204.7103, 204.7104, and 204.7105.

        (b) Modifications to existing contract line items or exhibit line items. (1) If the modification relates to existing contract line items or exhibit line items, the modification shall refer to those item numbers.

        (2) If the contracting officer decides to assign new identifications to existing contract or exhibit line items, the following rules apply—

        (i)  (A) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the total quantity of the original line item or subline.

        (B) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification makes only minor changes in the specifications of some of the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the resulting changes in unit price can be averaged to provide a new single unit price for the total quantity. If the changes in the specifications make the item significantly distinguishable from the original item or the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new line item.

        (C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and the change does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number shall remain with the unchanged quantity. Assign the changed quantity the next available number.

        (ii)  In addition to the rules in paragraph (b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to undefinitized items—

        (A) If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity of an existing definitized item, assign the undefinitized quantity the next available number.

        (B) If the modification increases the quantity of an existing undefinitized item, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is expected to be the same as the price for the original quantity. If the unit prices of the two quantities will be different, assign the new quantity the next available number.

        (C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and definitizes the price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the original item number. If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, assign it the next available number. However, if the modification definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added into the quantity of the existing item.

        (D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item but does not change the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall retain the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number. Assign the changed portion the next available number.

        (3) If the modification will decrease the amount obligated—

        (i) There shall be coordination between the administrative and procuring contracting offices before issuance of the modification; and

        (ii) The contracting officer shall not issue the modification unless sufficient unliquidated obligation exists or the purpose is to recover monies owed to the Government.

        204.7302   Policy.

#### § 204.7302

        (a)(1) Contractors and subcontractors are required to provide adequate security on all covered contractor information systems.

        (2) Contractors required to implement NIST SP 800-171, in accordance with the clause at 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber incident Reporting, are required at time of award to have at least a Basic NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment that is current ( not more than 3 years old unless a lesser time is specified in the solicitation) (see 252.204-7019).

        (3) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology is located at

        (4) High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments will be conducted by Government personnel using NIST SP 800-171A, “Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information.”

        (5) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment will not duplicate efforts from any other DoD assessment or the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) (see subpart 204.75), except for rare circumstances when a re-assessment may be necessary, such as, but not limited to, when cybersecurity risks, threats, or awareness have changed, requiring a re-assessment to ensure current compliance.

        (b) Contractors and subcontractors are required to rapidly report cyber incidents directly to DoD at  Subcontractors provide the incident report number automatically assigned by DoD to the prime contractor. Lower-tier subcontractors likewise report the incident report number automatically assigned by DoD to their higher-tier subcontractor, until the prime contractor is reached.

        (1) If a cyber incident occurs, contractors and subcontractors submit to DoD—

        (i) A cyber incident report;

        (ii) Malicious software, if detected and isolated; and

        (iii) Media (or access to covered contractor information systems and equipment) upon request.

        (2) Contracting officers shall refer to PGI 204.7303-4(c) for instructions on contractor submissions of media and malicious software.

        (c) Information shared by the contractor may include contractor attributional/proprietary information that is not customarily shared outside of the company, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information could cause substantial competitive harm to the contractor that reported the information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information.

        (d) A cyber incident that is reported by a contractor or subcontractor shall not, by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to provide adequate security on their covered contractor information systems, or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the clause at 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. When a cyber incident is reported, the contracting officer shall consult with the DoD component Chief Information Officer/cyber security office prior to assessing contractor compliance (see PGI 204.7303-3(a)(3)). The contracting officer shall consider such cyber incidents in the context of an overall assessment of a contractor's compliance with the requirements of the clause at 252.204-7012.

        (e) Support services contractors directly supporting Government activities related to safeguarding covered defense information and cyber incident reporting ( forensic analysis, damage assessment,, or other services that require access to data from another contractor) are subject to restrictions on use and disclosure of reported information.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 61519, Sept. 29, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

        204.7500   Scope of subpart.

#### § 204.7500

        (a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for including the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level requirements in DoD contracts. CMMC is a framework that measures a contractor's cybersecurity maturity to include the implementation of cybersecurity practices and institutionalization of processes (see ).

        (b) This subpart does not abrogate any other requirements regarding contractor physical, personnel, information, technical, or general administrative security operations governing the protection of unclassified information, nor does it affect requirements of the National Industrial Security Program.

        204.7501   Policy.

#### § 204.7501

        (a) The contracting officer shall include in the solicitation the required CMMC level, if provided by the requiring activity. Contracting officers shall not award a contract, task order, or delivery order to an offeror that does not have a current ( not more than 3 years old) CMMC certificate at the level required by the solicitation.

        (b) Contractors are required to achieve, at time of award, a CMMC certificate at the level specified in the solicitation. Contractors are required to maintain a current ( not more than 3 years old) CMMC certificate at the specified level, if required by the statement of work or requirement document, throughout the life of the contract, task order, or delivery order. Contracting officers shall not exercise an option period or extend the period of performance on a contract, task order, or delivery order, unless the contract has a current ( not more than 3 years old) CMMC certificate at the level required by the contract, task order, or delivery order.

        (c) The CMMC Assessments shall not duplicate efforts from any other comparable DoD assessment, except for rare circumstances when a re-assessment may be necessary such as, but not limited to when there are indications of issues with cybersecurity and/or compliance with CMMC requirements.

        204.7502   Procedures.

#### § 204.7502

        (a) When a requiring activity identifies a requirement for a contract, task order, or delivery order to include a specific CMMC level, the contracting officer shall not—

        (1) Award to an offeror that does not have a CMMC certificate at the level required by the solicitation; or

        (2) Exercise an option or extend any period of performance on a contract, task order, or delivery order unless the contractor has a CMMC certificate at the level required by the contract.

        (b) Contracting officers shall use Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) () to verify an offeror or contractor's CMMC level.

        204.7503   Contract clause.

#### § 204.7503

        Use the clause at 252.204-7021, Contractor Compliance with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification Level Requirement, as follows:

        (a) Until September 30, 2025, in solicitations and contracts or task orders or delivery orders, including those using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, except for solicitations and contracts or orders solely for the acquisition of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, if the requirement document or statement of work requires a contractor to have a specific CMMC level. In order to implement a phased rollout of CMMC, inclusion of a CMMC requirement in a solicitation during this time period must be approved by OUSD(A&S).

        (b) On or after October 1, 2025, in all solicitations and contracts or task orders or delivery orders, including those using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, except for solicitations and contracts or orders solely for the acquisition of COTS items.

      Subpart 204.76—Supplier Performance Risk System

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 17338, Mar. 22, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

        204.7600   Scope of subpart.

#### § 204.7600

        This subpart provides policies and procedures for use of the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) risk assessments in the evaluation of a quotation or offer.

        204.7601   Definitions.

#### § 204.7601

        As used in this subpart—

        means the probability that a product, based on intended use, will introduce performance risk resulting in safety issues, mission degradation, or monetary loss.

        means the measure of whether a proposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.

        means the probability that an award may subject the procurement to the risk of unsuccessful performance or to supply chain risk (see 239.7301).

        204.7602   Applicability.

#### § 204.7602

        Use of SPRS risk assessments is required for the evaluation of quotations or offers in response to solicitations for supplies and services, including solicitations using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, excluding solicitations for the procurement of supplies or services exempted by the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.79, Defense-wide Sharing and Use of Supplier and Product Performance Information. SPRS retrieves item, price, quality, delivery, and contractor information from contracts in Government reporting systems in order to develop risk assessments of contractors. SPRS is available at  and the SPRS user's guides are available at

        204.7603   Procedures.

#### § 204.7603

        The contracting officer shall consider price risk and supplier risk, if available in SPRS, as a part of the award decision. For procurement of an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall also consider assessments of item risk, if available, as a part of the award decision. Offerors or quoters without a risk assessment in SPRS shall not be considered favorably or unfavorably. Contracting officers shall use their discretion in considering the information available in SPRS on item risk, price risk, and supplier risk as follows:

        (a)  (1) Consider item risk to determine whether the procurement of products represents a high performance risk to the Government. If an item has a high risk rating, then the SPRS item risk report will display the reason(s) an item is identified as high risk.

        (2) Before issuing a solicitation for the procurement of an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall ensure a SPRS item risk search has been performed and shall consider any item risk warnings provided. When evaluating quotations or offers for an end product identified by a material identifier, a SPRS item risk search is required for any end product that did not have an item risk search performed prior to solicitation. If there are item risk warnings, the contracting officer shall consider strategies to mitigate risk, such as the following:

        (i) Consulting with the program office.

        (ii) Including mitigating requirements in the statement of work, as provided by the requiring activity.

        (iii) Including FAR and DFARS clauses identified in the SPRS application, as appropriate.

        (b)  (1) When procuring a service or an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall consider price risk assessment in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for an item or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. Contracting officers shall not rely solely on the price risk assessment when determining prices to be fair and reasonable.

        (2) The contracting officer shall consider strategies to mitigate price risk, such as the following:

        (i) Not awarding to offerors or quoters with high risk price ratings unless there is a way to justify the price through additional price or cost analysis.

        (ii) Utilizing appropriate price negotiation techniques and procedures.

        (iii) Using price reasonableness or price realism techniques at FAR 13.106 or 15.4. See also 215.403-3 when making award decisions.

        (c)  The contracting officer shall consider supplier risk, to assess the risk of unsuccessful performance and supply chain risk, in award decisions. Supplier risk assessments in SPRS include quality, delivery, and other contractor performance information.

        204.7604   Solicitation provision.

#### § 204.7604

        Except for supplies or services exempted by DoDI 5000.79, use the provision at 252.204-7024, Notice on the Use of the Supplier Performance Risk System, in solicitations for supplies and services, including solicitations using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.

        207.106   Additional requirements for major systems.

#### § 207.106

        (b)(1)(A) The contracting officer is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 3208(d)(1) from requiring offers for development or production of major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, unless the contracting officer determines that—

        () The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements;

        () Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to meet mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs; or

        () The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in technical data.

        (B) If the contracting officer makes a determination, under paragraphs (b)(_1_)(A) () and () of this section, for a competitive solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 3_2_08(d)(2) requires that the evaluation of items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.

        (S-70)(1) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3774(a) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems shall—

        (i) Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems; and

        (ii) Establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical data and computer software deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their life cycle. The strategy may include—

        (A) The development of maintenance capabilities within DoD; or

        (B) Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or subsystems.

        (2) Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed under this section shall—

        (i) Be developed before issuance of a solicitation for the weapon system or subsystem;

        (ii) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4328, to emphasize reliability and maintainability in weapon system design, ensure that reliability and maintainability are included in the performance attributes of the key performance parameters on sustainment during the development of capabilities requirements. For additional guidance see PGI 207.105(b)(14)(ii)

        (iii) Address the merits of including a priced contract option for the future delivery of technical data and computer software, and associated license rights, that were not acquired upon initial contract award;

        (iv) Address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life cycle of the weapon system or subsystem; and

        (v) Apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by performance-based logistics arrangements as well as to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.

        (S-71) See 209.570 for policy applicable to acquisition strategies that consider the use of lead system integrators.

        (S-72)(1) In accordance with section 202 of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-23), acquisition plans for major defense acquisition programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 4201, shall include measures that—

        (i) Ensure competition, or the option of competition, at both the prime contract level and subcontract level (at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) throughout the program life cycle as a means to improve contractor performance; and

        (ii) Document the rationale for the selection of the appropriate subcontract tier or tiers under paragraph (S-72)(1)(i) of this section, and the measures which will be employed to ensure competition, or the option of competition.

        (2) Measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, may include, but are not limited to, cost-effective measures intended to achieve the following:

        (i) Competitive prototyping.

        (ii) Dual-sourcing.

        (iii) Unbundling of contracts.

        (iv) Funding of next-generation prototype systems or subsystems.

        (v) Use of modular, open architectures to enable competition for upgrades.

        (vi) Use of build-to-print approaches to enable production through multiple sources.

        (vii) Acquisition of complete technical data packages.

        (viii) Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades.

        (i) Require prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems and components of major weapon systems;

        (ii) Provide for Government surveillance of the process by which prime contractors consider such sources and determine whether to conduct such development or construction in-house or through a subcontract; and

        (iii) Provide for the assessment of the extent to which the prime contractor has given full and fair consideration to qualified sources in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance evaluations.

        (4) Whenever a source-of-repair decision results in a plan to award a contract for the performance of maintenance and sustainment services on a major weapon system, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, the acquisition plan shall prescribe that award will be made on a competitive basis after giving full consideration to all sources (including sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector repair activities).

        (5) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4328, acquisition plans for engineering manufacturing and development and production of major systems as defined in 10 U.S.C. 3041(a) and 4202 and for major defense acquisition programs as defined in 202.101, shall include performance measures that are developed using best practices for responding to the positive or negative performance of a contractor for the engineering and manufacturing development or production of a weapon system, including embedded software. At a minimum the contracting officer shall—

        (i) Encourage the use of incentive fees and penalties as appropriate; and

        (ii) Allow the program manager or comparable requiring activity official exercising program management responsibilities, to base determinations of a contractor's performance on reliability and maintainability data collected during the program. Such data collection and associated evaluation metrics shall be described in detail in the contract; and to the maximum extent practicable, the data shall be shared with appropriate contractor and Government organizations.

        (S-73) In accordance with section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapons systems shall include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) may waive this requirement if USD(A&S) determines that it is in the best interest of DoD.

#### § 207.171-3

        DoD policy is to break out components of weapons systems or other major end items under certain circumstances.

        (a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected to acquire any component without adequate price competition, the agency shall break out that component if—

        (1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and

        (2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, performance, or timely delivery of the end item.

        (b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component will be acquired with adequate price competition, the agency shall consider breakout of the component if substantial net cost savings will result from—

        (1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or

        (2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training (through standardization of design).

        (c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.

        208.7000   Scope of subpart.

#### § 208.7000

        This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for acquisition of items for which contracting responsibility is assigned to one or more of the departments/agencies or the General Services Administration. Contracting responsibility is assigned through—

        (a) The Coordinated Acquisition Program (commodity assignments are listed in PGI 208.7006); or

        (b) The Integrated Materiel Management Program (assignments are in DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items).

        208.7001   Definitions.

#### § 208.7001

        For purposes of this subpart—

        means the department, agency, or General Services Administration which has contracting responsibility under the Coordinated Acquisition Program.

        means assignment of acquisition management responsibility to one department, agency, or the General Services Administration for all of DoD's requirements for the assigned item. Acquisition management normally includes computing requirements, funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and contracting functions.

        means the department or agency which has the requirement for an item.

        208.7002   Assignment authority.

#### § 208.7002

        (a) Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a single department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). Commodity assignments are made—

        (1) To the departments and agencies, by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics);

        (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics);

        (3) Outside the contiguous United States, by the Unified Commanders; and

        (4) For acquisitions to be made in the contiguous United States for commodities not assigned under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, by agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 3065).

        (i) Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The submission of a military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) by a requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of another department, even though based on an oral communication, constitutes a one-time agreement.

        (ii) Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and distribute them to all activities concerned.

        (b) Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments are made by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics)—

        (1) To the departments and agencies; and

        (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA.

        (a) Acquire all items assigned for IMM from the IMM manager except—

        (1) Items purchased under circumstances of unusual and compelling urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2. After such a purchase is made, the requiring activity must send one copy of the contract and a statement of the emergency to the IMM manager;

        (2) Items for which the IMM manager assigns a supply system code for local purchase or otherwise grants authority to purchase locally; or

        (3) When purchase by the requiring activity is in the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. This exception does not apply to items—

        (i) Critical to the safe operation of a weapon system;

        (ii) With special security characteristics; or

        (iii) Which are dangerous (e.g., explosives, munitions).

        (b) Follow the procedures at PGI 208.7003-1(b) when an item assigned for IMM is to be acquired by the requiring department in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection.

        208.7003-2   Assignments under coordinated acquisition.

#### § 208.7003-2

        Requiring departments must submit to the acquiring department all contracting requirements for items assigned for coordinated acquisition, except—

        (a) Items obtained through the sources in FAR 8.002(a)(1) (i) through (vii);

        (b) Items obtained under 208.7003-1(a);

        (c) Requirements not in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold in FAR part 2, when contracting by the requiring department is in the best interest of the Government;

        (d) In an emergency. When an emergency purchase is made, the requiring department must send one copy of the contract and a statement of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring department;

        (e) Requirements for which the acquiring department's contracting activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring department;

        (f) Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR part 35). Under this exception, the military departments may contract for research and development requirements, including quantities for testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception applies only when research and development funds are used.

        (g) Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled by the Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear weapons.

        (1) This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.

        (2) This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special testing procedures.

        (h) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security requires limitation of sources);

        (i) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only from the original source for follow-on contract);

        (j) Items directly related to a major system and which are design controlled by and acquired from either the system manufacturer or a manufacturer of a major subsystem;

        (k) Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign or modification during the production and/or operational use phases, which require continual contact between industry and the requiring department to ensure that the item meets the requirements:

        (1) This exception permits the requiring department to contract for items of highly unstable design. For use of this exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring department. Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.

        (2) This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between industry and the requiring department;

        (l) Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;

        (m) One-time buy of a noncataloged item.

        (1) This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item. This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.

        (2) This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.

        (b) If the contracting officer and the contractor have agreed to mitigation of an organizational conflict of interest, a Government-approved Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, reflecting the actions a contractor has agreed to take to mitigate a conflict, shall be incorporated into the contract.

        (c) If the contracting officer determines, after consultation with agency legal counsel, that the otherwise successful offeror is unable to effectively mitigate an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer, taking into account both the instant contract and longer term Government needs, shall use another approach to resolve the organizational conflict of interest, select another offeror, or request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 (but  statutory prohibition in 209.571-7, which cannot be waived).

        (d) For any acquisition that exceeds $1 billion, the contracting officer shall brief the senior procurement executive before determining that an offeror's mitigation plan is unacceptable.

#### § 211.274-1

        Item unique identification and valuation is a system of marking, valuing, and tracking items delivered to DoD that enhances logistics, contracting, and financial business transactions supporting the United States and coalition troops. Through item unique identification policy, which capitalizes on leading practices and embraces open standards, DoD—

        (a) Achieves lower life-cycle cost of item management and improves life-cycle property management;

        (b) Improves operational readiness;

        (c) Provides reliable accountability of property and asset visibility throughout the life cycle;

        (d) Reduces the burden on the workforce through increased productivity and efficiency; and

        (e) Ensures item level traceability throughout lifecycle to strengthen supply chain integrity, enhance cyber security, and combat counterfeiting.

        211.274-2   Policy for item unique identification.

#### § 211.274-2

        (a) It is DoD policy that DoD item unique identification, or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent, is required for all delivered items, including items of contractor-acquired property delivered on contract line items (see PGI 245.402-71 for guidance when delivery of contractor acquired property is required)—

        (1) For which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more;

        (2) For which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when the requiring activity determines that item unique identification is required for mission essential or controlled inventory items; or

        (3) Regardless of value for any—

        (i) DoD serially managed item (reparable or nonreparable) or subassembly, component, or part embedded within a subassembly, component, or part;

        (ii) Parent item (as defined in 252.211-7003(a)) that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part;

        (iii) Warranted serialized item;

        (iv) Item of special tooling or special test equipment, as defined at FAR 2.101, for a major defense acquisition program that is designated for preservation and storage in accordance with the requirements of section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417); and

        (v) High risk item identified by the requiring activity as vulnerable to supply chain threat, a target of cyber threats, or counterfeiting.

        (b)  The contractor will not be required to provide DoD item unique identification if—

        (1) The items, as determined by the head of the contracting activity, are to be used to support a contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operation; to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; to facilitate the provision of international disaster assistance; or to support response to an emergency or major disaster; or

        (2) A determination and findings has been executed concluding that it is more cost effective for the Government requiring activity to assign, mark, and register the unique item identifier after delivery, and the item is either acquired from a small business concern, or is a commercial product acquired under FAR part 12 or 8.

        (i) The determination and findings shall be executed by—

        (A) The Component Acquisition Executive for an acquisition category (ACAT) I program; or

        (B) The head of the contracting activity for all other programs.

        (ii) The DoD Unique Identification Policy Office must receive a copy of the determination and findings required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this subsection. Follow the procedures at PGI 211.274-2.

#### § 212.102

        (a)(i)  Use of FAR part 12 procedures is based on—

        (A) A determination that an item is a commercial product or commercial service (see paragraph (a)(iii) of this section); or

        (B) Applicability of one of the following statutes that provide for treatment as a commercial product or commercial service and use of FAR part 12 procedures, even though the item may not meet the definition of “commercial product” or “commercial service” at FAR 2.101 and does not require a commercial product or commercial service determination:

        () 4_1_ U.S.C. 1903—Supplies or services to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack pursuant to FAR 12.102(f).

        () 10 U.S.C. 3457 —Supplies or services from nontraditional defense contractors pursuant to _2_12.102(a)(iv).

        () 10 U.S.C. _3_458—Supplies or services resulting from a commercial solutions opening pursuant to subpart 212.70.

        (ii)  (A) Pursuant to _1_0 U.S.C. 3456(c), except as provided in paragraph (a)(ii)(B) of this section or unless the item was acquired pursuant to paragraph (a)(i)(B) of this section, if the Commercial Item Database (for website see PGI 212.102(a)(iii)(A)()) contains a prior commerciality determination, or the contracting officer has other evidence that an item has previously been acquired by DoD using commercial product and commercial service acquisition procedures under FAR part 12, then the prior contract shall serve as a prior determination that an item is a a commercial product or commercial service. The contracting officer shall document the file accordingly.

        (B)() If the item to be acquired meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(_ii_)(A) of this section, the item may not be acquired using other than FAR part _1__2_ procedures unless the head of the contracting activity issues a determination as specified in paragraph (a)(ii)(B)()() of this section.

        () Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3703(d)(1), the contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial product or commercial service determination made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of DoD shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3703(d) and 10 U.S.C. 3456(c), if the contracting officer questions a prior determination to use FAR part 1_2_ procedures and instead chooses to proceed with a procurement of an item previously determined to be a commercial item using procedures other than FAR part 12 procedures, the contracting officer shall request a review by the head of the contracting activity that will conduct the procurement. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request for review, the head of the contracting activity shall—

        () Conf_i_rm that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was appropriate and still applicable; or

        ( Issue a determination that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was improper or that it is no longer appropriate to acquire the item using FAR part 12 procedures, with a written explanation of the basis for the determination.

        (iii)  Unless the procedures in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section are applicable, when using FAR part 12 procedures for acquisitions of commercial products and commercial service pursuant to 212.102(a)(i)(A) that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer shall—

        (A) Determine in writing that the acquisition meets the “commercial product” or “commercial service” definition in FAR 2.101. See 234.7002(b) and (c) for subsystems of major weapon systems and components and spare parts of major weapon systems and of subsystems of major weapon systems;

        (B) Include the written determination in the contract file;

        (C) Obtain approval at one level above the contracting officer when a commercial product or commercial service determination relies on paragraph (1)(ii), (3), or (4) of the “commercial product” definition at FAR 2.101 or paragraph (2) of the “commercial service” definition at FAR 2.101; and

        (D) Follow the procedures and guidance at PGI 212.102(a)(iii) regarding file documentation and commercial product or commercial service determinations.

        (iv)  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3457, contracting officers—

        (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(iv)(B) of this section, may treat supplies and services provided by nontraditional defense contractors as commercial products or commercial services. This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current other than commercial products or commercial services; however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial product or commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial product and commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial product or commercial service determination and does not mean the item is commercial;

        (B) Shall treat services provided by a business unit that is a nontraditional defense contractor as commercial services, to the extent that such services use the same pool of employees as used for commercial customers and are priced using methodology similar to methodology used for commercial pricing; and

        (C) Shall document the file when treating supplies or services from a nontraditional defense contractor as commercial products or commercial services in accordance with paragraph (a)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.

#### § 212.209

        (a) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3453(d), agencies shall conduct or obtain market research to support the determination of the reasonableness of price for commercial products and commercial services contained in any bid or offer submitted in response to an agency solicitation. To the extent necessary to support such market research, the contracting officer—

        (1) In the case of major weapon systems, for subsystems of major weapon systems and components and spare parts of major weapon systems and of subsystems of major weapon systems acquired as commercial products in accordance with subpart 234.70, shall use information submitted under 234.7002(e); and

        (2) In the case of other items, may require the offeror to submit other relevant information.

        (b) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial products or commercial services under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. In assessing whether the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison, the contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (10 U.S.C. 3703(e)).

        (c) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—

        (1) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;

        (2) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;

        (3) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and

        (4) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.

        (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the contracting officer from requiring the contractor to supply information that is sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, regardless of whether or not the contractor was required to provide such information in connection with any earlier procurement. If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer may request other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including uncertified cost data such as labor costs, material costs, and other direct and indirect costs.

        212.7002   Policy.

#### § 212.7002

        (a) Contracting officers may only use a CSO—

        (1) To obtain innovative solutions or potential capabilities that fulfill requirements;

        (1) Describe the agency's interest for an individual program requirement or for broadly defined areas of interest covering the full range of the agency's requirements;

        (2) Specify the technical data required that may be necessary to meet DoD's minimum requirements (see 227.7102 and 227.7202);

        (3) Describe the evaluation factors for selecting proposals to include—

        (i) Technical and importance to agency programs as the primary evaluation factors;

#### § 215.101-2-70

        The following limitations and prohibitions apply when considering the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures.

        (a)

        (1) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114-328) as amended by section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 3241 note prec.), the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process shall only be used when—

        (i) Minimum requirements can be described clearly and comprehensively and expressed in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine the acceptability of offers;

        (ii) No, or minimal, value will be realized from a proposal that exceeds the minimum technical or performance requirements;

        (iii) The proposed technical approaches will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror's proposal versus a competing proposal;

        (iv) The source selection authority has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit;

        (v) No, or minimal, additional innovation or future technological advantage will be realized by using a different source selection process;

        (vi) Goods to be procured are predominantly expendable in nature, are nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or short shelf life (See PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vi) for assistance with evaluating whether a requirement satisfies this limitation);

        (vii) The contract file contains a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs (as defined at FAR 7.101) of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired (see PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vii) for information on obtaining this determination); and

        (viii) The contracting officer documents the contract file describing the circumstances justifying the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.

        (2) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, as amended by section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 3241 note prec.), contracting officers shall avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process in the case of a procurement that is predominately for the acquisition of—

        (i) Information technology services, cybersecurity services, systems engineering and technical assistance services, advanced electronic testing, or other knowledge-based professional services;

        (ii) Items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment (except see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); or

        (iii) Services designated by the requiring activity as knowledge-based training or logistics services in contingency operations or other operations outside the United States, including in Afghanistan or Iraq.

        (b)

        (1) In accordance with section 814 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114-328) as amended by section 882 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to procure items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment or an aviation critical safety item, when the requiring activity advises the contracting officer that the level of quality or failure of the equipment or item could result in combat casualties. See 252.209-7010 for the definition and identification of critical safety items.

        (2) In accordance with section 832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (see 10 U.S.C. 4232), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire engineering and manufacturing development for a major defense acquisition program for which budgetary authority is requested beginning in fiscal year 2019.

        (3) Contracting officers shall make award decisions based on best value factors and criteria, as determined by the resource sponsor (in accordance with agency procedures), for an auditing contract. The use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is prohibited (10 U.S.C. 240f).

Temporary structures covered by this paragraph are nonpermanent buildings, including tactical shelters, nonpermanent modular or pre-fabricated buildings, or portable or relocatable buildings, such as trailers or equipment configured for occupancy (see also 246.270-2). Determination of best value includes consideration of the total life-cycle costs of such tents or structures, including the costs associated with any equipment, fuel, or electricity needed to heat, cool, or light such tents or structures (see FAR 7.105(a)(3)(i) and PGI 207.105(a)(3)(i)).

        (b) The requirements of this section apply to any agency or department that acquires tents or other temporary structures on behalf of DoD (see FAR 17.503(d)(2)).

The contracting officer shall evaluate the extent to which offerors identify and commit to small business performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.

        (A) See PGI 215.304(c)(i)(A) for examples of evaluation factors.

        (B) Proposals addressing the extent of small business performance shall be separate from subcontracting plans submitted pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and shall be structured to allow for consideration of offers from small businesses.

        (C) When an evaluation assesses the extent that small businesses are specifically identified in proposals, the small businesses considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9 to facilitate compliance with 252.219-7003(e).

        (ii) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4293, consider the purchase of capital assets (including machine tools) manufactured in the United States, in source selections for all major defense acquisition programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 4201.

#### § 215.371-3

        For acquisitions that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and it is not necessary to resolicit in accordance with 215.371-2(a), then then the contracting officer shall comply with the following:

        (a) If no additional cost or pricing data are required to determine through cost or price analysis that the offered price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer shall require that any cost or pricing data provided in the proposal be certified if the acquisition exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold and an exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-1(b)(2) through (5) does not apply.

        (b) Otherwise, the contracting officer shall obtain additional cost or pricing data to determine a fair and reasonable price. If the acquisition exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold and an exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-1(b)(2) through (5) does not apply, the cost or pricing data shall be certified.

        (c) If the contracting officer is still unable to determine that the offered price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer shall enter into negotiations with the offeror to establish a fair and reasonable price. The negotiated price should not exceed the offered price.

        (d) If the contracting officer is unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, see FAR 15.405(d).

#### § 215.401

        As used in this subpart—

        means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors.

        means information provided by an offeror of sales of the same or similar items that can be used to establish price reasonableness taking into consideration the age, volume, and nature of the transactions (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).

#### § 215.402

        (a)(i) Pursuant to section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)—

        (A) The contracting officer is responsible for determining if the information provided by the offeror is sufficient to determine price reasonableness. This responsibility includes determining whether information on the prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of price, and determining the extent of uncertified cost data that should be required in cases in which price information is not adequate;

        (B) The contracting officer shall not limit the Government's ability to obtain any data that may be necessary to support a determination of fair and reasonable pricing by agreeing to contract terms that preclude obtaining necessary supporting information; and

        (C) When obtaining uncertified cost data, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to provide the information in the form in which it is regularly maintained in the offeror's business operations.

        (ii) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.402 when conducting cost or price analysis, particularly with regard to acquisitions for sole source commercial products or commercial services.

        215.403   Obtaining certified cost or pricing data.

#### § 215.403

        215.403-1   Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing data (10 U.S.C. chapter 271 and 41 U.S.C. chapter 35).

#### § 215.403-1

        (b)  (i) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(b).

        (ii) Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required in the case of a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract to the extent such data relates to an indirect offset.

        (c) —(1)

        (A) For acquisitions under dual or multiple source programs—

        () The determination of adequate price competition must be made on a case-by-case basis. Even when adequate price competition exists, in certain cases it may be appropriate to obtain additional data to assist in price analysis; and

        () Adequate price competition normally exists when—

        () Pr_i_ces are solicited across a full range of step quantities, normally including a 0-100 percent split, from at least two offerors that are individually capable of producing the full quantity; and

        () The reasonableness of all prices awarded is clearly established on the basis of price analysis (see FAR 15.404-1(b)).

        (B) If only one offer is received in response to a competitive solicitation, see 215.371-3.

        (3)   (A) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(c)(3) for pricing commercial products or commercial services, except see 234.7002(e) for pricing commercial subsystems of major weapon systems and components and spare parts of major weapon systems and of subsystems of major weapon systems.

        (B) When applying the commercial item exception under FAR 15.403-1(b)(3), see 212.102(a)(ii) regarding prior commercial product or commercial service determinations.

        (4)  (A) The head of the contracting activity may, without power of delegation, apply the exceptional circumstances authority when a determination is made that—

        () The property or services cannot reasonably be obtained under the contract, subcontract, or modification, without the granting of the waiver;

        () The price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without the submission of certified cost or pricing data; and

        () There are demonstrated benefits to granting the waiver. Follow the procedures at PGI 215.40_3_-1(c)(4)(A) for determining when an exceptional case waiver is appropriate, for approval of such waivers, for partial waivers, and for waivers applicable to unpriced supplies or services.

        (B) By November 30th of each year, departments and agencies shall provide a report to the Office of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy, (Price, Cost and Finance), of all waivers granted under FAR 15.403-1(b)(4), during the previous fiscal year, for any contract, subcontract, or modification expected to have a value of $20 million or more. See PGI 215.403-1(c)(4)(B) for the format and guidance for the report.

        (C) DoD has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data for the Canadian Commercial Corporation and its subcontractors (but see 215.408(3) and 225.870-4(c)).

        (D) DoD has waived certified cost or pricing data requirements for nonprofit organizations (including education institutions) on cost-reimbursement-no-fee contracts. The contracting officer shall require—

        () Submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine reasonableness and cost realism; and

        () Certified cost or pricing data from subcontractors that are not nonprofit organizations when the subcontractor's proposal exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1).

        (a) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2306a(d)—

        (1) Contracting officers shall not determine the price of a contract or subcontract to be fair and reasonable based solely on historical prices paid by the Government (see PGI 215.403-3(4)); and

        (4) In lieu of the factors for consideration listed in FAR 15.403-3(a)(4), a determination by the head of the contracting activity (see PGI 215.403-3(7)) that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to an offeror that does not make a good faith effort to comply with a reasonable request to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data shall be based on consideration of pertinent factors, including the following:

        (i) The effort to obtain the data.

        (ii) Availability of other sources of supply of the item or service.

        (iii) The urgency or criticality of the Government's need for the item or service.

        (iv) Reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract based on information available to the contracting officer.

        (v) Rationale or justification made by the offeror for not providing the requested data.

        215.404   Proposal analysis.

#### § 215.404

        215.404-1   Proposal analysis techniques.

#### § 215.404-1

        (a)  (i) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1 for proposal analysis.

        (ii) For spare parts or support equipment, perform an analysis of—

        (A) Those line items where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent or more the lowest price the Government has paid within the most recent 12-month period based on reasonably available data;

        (B) Those line items where a comparison of the item description and the proposal price indicates a potential for overpricing;

        (C) Significant high-dollar-value items. If there are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random sample of items; and

        (D) A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items. Sample size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., experience with the offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.

        (b)  (i) In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI 215.404-1(b)(i)).

        (ii) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial products or commercial services under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. Price reasonableness shall not be based solely on historical prices paid by the Government (see 215.403-3(a)(1)). The contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (10 U.S.C. 3703(e)).

        (iii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—

        (A) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;

        (B) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;

        (C) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and

        (D) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.

        (iv) If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data. However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).

        (v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors (see PGI 215.404-1(b)(v)). For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:

        (A)

        (B)

        () Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry ( rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity ( stable), economic factors ( new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.

        () A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.

        (C)  Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers. The data must also include key information, such as date, quantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer. If the number of transactions is insufficient or the data is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness. If the contractor cannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.

        (D)  The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand the transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer (government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements. It also includes warranties, key product technical specifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.

        (vi) The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and supported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments). The contracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and relevant sales data.

        (vii) The contracting officer may consult with the DoD cadre of experts who are available to provide expert advice to the acquisition workforce in assisting with commercial product or commercial service determinations and price reasonableness determinations. The DoD cadre of experts is identified at PGI 215.404-1(b)(vii).

        (viii) When procuring a service or an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall consider the Supplier Performance Risk System price risk assessments in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for an item or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. See also 215.403-3(a)(1).

        (h)  Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1(h)(2) when considering alternative approaches or making the determination that the contracting approach selected is in the best interest of the Government, as required by FAR 15.404-1(h)(2).

#### § 215.404-4

        (b)  (1) Contracting officers shall use a structured approach for developing a prenegotiation profit or fee objective on any negotiated contract action when certified cost or pricing data is obtained, except for cost-plus-award-fee contracts (see 215.404-74, 216.405-2, and FAR 16.405-2) or contracts with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) (see 215.404-75). There are three structured approaches—

        (A) The weighted guidelines method;

        (B) The modified weighted guidelines method; and

        (C) An alternate structured approach.

        (c)  (1) Also, do not perform a profit analysis when assessing cost realism in competitive acquisitions.

        (2) When using a structured approach, the contracting officer—

        (A) Shall use the weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-71), except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(C) of this subsection.

        (B) Shall use the modified weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-72) on contract actions with nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.

        (C) May use an alternate structured approach (see 215.404-73) when—

        () The contract action is—

        () At or below the cert_i_fied cost or pricing data threshold (see FAR 15.403-4(a)(1));

        () For architect-engineer or construction work;

        () Primarily for delivery of material from subcontractors; or

        () A termination settlement; or

        () The weighted guidelines method does not produce a reasonable overall profit objective and the head of the contracting activity approves use of the alternate approach in writing.

        (D) Shall use the weighted guidelines method to establish a basic profit rate under a formula-type pricing agreement, and may then use the basic rate on all actions under the agreement, provided that conditions affecting profit do not change.

        (E) Shall document the profit analysis in the contract file.

        (5) Although specific agreement on the applied weights or values for individual profit factors shall not be attempted, the contracting officer may encourage the contractor to—

        (A) Present the details of its proposed profit amounts in the weighted guidelines format or similar structured approached; and

        (B) Use the weighted guidelines method in developing profit objectives for negotiated subcontracts.

        (6) The contracting officer must also verify that relevant variables have not materially changed (e.g., performance risk, interest rates, progress payment rates, distribution of facilities capital).

        (d) —(1)  The common factors are embodied in the DoD structured approaches and need not be further considered by the contracting officer.

#### § 215.404-71

        215.404-71-1   General.

#### § 215.404-71-1

        (a) The weighted guidelines method focuses on four profit factors—

        (1) Performance risk;

        (2) Contract type risk;

        (3) Facilities capital employed; and

        (4) Cost efficiency.

        (b) The contracting officer assigns values to each profit factor; the value multiplied by the base results in the profit objective for that factor. Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit factor has a normal value and a designated range of values. The normal value is representative of average conditions on the prospective contract when compared to all goods and services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal conditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the normal value, but should address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal value. The cost efficiency special factor has no normal value. The contracting officer shall exercise sound business judgment in selecting a value when this special factor is used (see 215.404-71-5).

        215.404-71-2   Performance risk.

#### § 215.404-71-2

        (a)  This profit factor addresses the contractor's degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The factor consists of two parts:

        (1) Technical—the technical uncertainties of performance.

        (2) Management/cost control—the degree of management effort necessary—

        (i) To ensure that contract requirements are met; and

        (ii) To reduce and control costs.

        (b)  The following extract from the DD Form 1547 is annotated to describe the process.

        (1) Assign a weight (percentage) to each element according to its input to the total performance risk. The total of the two weights equals 100 percent.

        (2) Select a value for each element from the list in paragraph (c) of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection.

        (3) Compute the composite as shown in the following example:

        (4) Insert the amount from Block 20 of the DD Form 1547. Block 20 is total contract costs, excluding facilities capital cost of money.

        (5) Multiply (3) by (4).

        (c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.

        (1)  The standard designated range should apply to most contracts.

        (2)  For the technical factor only, contracting officers may use the technology incentive range for acquisitions that include development, production, or application of innovative new technologies. The technology incentive range does not apply to efforts restricted to studies, analyses, or demonstrations that have a technical report as their primary deliverable.

        (d)  (1) Review the contract requirements and focus on the critical performance elements in the statement of work or specifications. Factors to consider include—

        (i) Technology being applied or developed by the contractor;

        (ii) Technical complexity;

        (iii) Program maturity;

        (iv) Performance specifications and tolerances;

        (v) Delivery schedule; and

        (vi) Extent of a warranty or guarantee.

        (2)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value in those cases where there is a substantial technical risk. Indicators are—

        (A) Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent tolerance limits;

        (B) The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use of state-of-the-art machinery;

        (C) The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to the Government and must be performed to exacting standards;

        (D) The contractor's independent development and investment has reduced the Government's risk or cost;

        (E) The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to meet DoD requirements; or

        (F) The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty provisions.

        (ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult technical obstacles that require personnel with exceptional abilities, experience, and professional credentials may justify a value significantly above normal.

        (iii) The following may justify a maximum value—

        (A) Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if performance or quality specifications are tight; or

        (B) A high degree of development or production concurrency.

        (3)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value in those cases where the technical risk is low. Indicators are—

        (A) Requirements are relatively simple;

        (B) Technology is not complex;

        (C) Efforts do not require highly skilled personnel;

        (D) Efforts are routine;

        (E) Programs are mature; or

        (F) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or a repetitive type acquisition.

        (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal for—

        (A) Routine services;

        (B) Production of simple items;

        (C) Rote entry or routine integration of Government-furnished information; or

        (D) Simple operations with Government-furnished property.

        (4)  (i) The contracting officer may assign values within the technology incentive range when contract performance includes the introduction of new, significant technological innovation. Use the technology incentive range only for the most innovative contract efforts. Innovation may be in the form of—

        (A) Development or application of new technology that fundamentally changes the characteristics of an existing product or system and that results in increased technical performance, improved reliability, or reduced costs; or

        (B) New products or systems that contain significant technological advances over the products or systems they are replacing.

        (ii) When selecting a value within the technology incentive range, the contracting officer should consider the relative value of the proposed innovation to the acquisition as a whole. When the innovation represents a minor benefit, the contracting officer should consider using values less than the norm. For innovative efforts that will have a major positive impact on the product or program, the contracting officer may use values above the norm.

        (e)  (1) The contracting officer should evaluate—

        (i) The contractor's management and internal control systems using contracting office data, information and reviews made by field contract administration offices or other DoD field offices;

        (ii) The management involvement expected on the prospective contract action;

        (iii) The degree of cost mix as an indication of the types of resources applied and value added by the contractor;

        (iv) The contractor's support of Federal socioeconomic programs;

        (v) The expected reliability of the contractor's cost estimates (including the contractor's cost estimating system);

        (vi) The adequacy of the contractor's management approach to controlling cost and schedule; and

        (vii) Any other factors that affect the contractor's ability to meet the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates).

        (2)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is a high degree of management effort. Indicators of this are—

        (A) The contractor's value added is both considerable and reasonably difficult;

        (B) The effort involves a high degree of integration or coordination;

        (C) The contractor has a good record of past performance;

        (D) The contractor has a substantial record of active participation in Federal socioeconomic programs;

        (E) The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost estimates;

        (F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy decisions; or

        (G) The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and control.

        (ii) The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the effort—

        (A) Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;

        (B) Involves major international activities with significant management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign vendors); or

        (C) Has critically important milestones.

        (iii) If the contractor demonstrates efficient management and cost control through the submittal of a timely, qualifying proposal (as defined in 217.7401) in furtherance of definitization of an undefinitized contract action, and the proposal demonstrates effective cost control from the time of award to the present, the contracting officer may add 1 percentage point to the value determined for management/cost control up to the maximum of 7 percent.

        (3)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the management effort is minimal. Indicators of this are—

        (A) The program is mature and many end item deliveries have been made;

        (B) The contractor adds minimal value to an item;

        (C) The efforts are routine and require minimal supervision;

        (D) The contractor provides poor quality, untimely proposals;

        (E) The contractor fails to provide an adequate analysis of subcontractor costs;

        (F) The contractor does not cooperate in the evaluation and negotiation of the proposal;

        (G) The contractor's cost estimating system is marginal;

        (H) The contractor has made minimal effort to initiate cost reduction programs;

        (I) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;

        (J) The contractor has a record of cost overruns or another indication of unreliable cost estimates and lack of cost control; or

        (K) The contractor has a poor record of past performance.

        (ii) The following may justify a value significantly below normal—

        (A) Reviews performed by the field contract administration offices disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control systems (e.g., quality assurance, property control, safety, security); or

        (B) The effort requires an unusually low degree of management involvement.

        215.404-71-3   Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.

#### § 215.404-71-3

        (a)  The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.

        (b)  The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.

        (1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) of this section using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (2)(i) Insert the amount of costs incurred as of the date the contractor submits a qualifying proposal, such as under an undefinitized contract action, (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24a column titled Base.

        (ii) Insert the amount of Government estimated cost to complete (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24b column titled Base.

        (3) Multiply (1) by (2)(i) and (2)(ii), respectively for Blocks 24a and 24b. Add Blocks 24a and 24b and insert the totals in Block 24c.

        (4) Only complete this block when the prospective contract is a fixed-price contract containing provisions for progress payments.

        (5) Insert the amount computed per paragraph (e) of this subsection.

        (6) Insert the appropriate figure from paragraph (f) of this subsection.

        (7) Use the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury (see ). Do not use any other interest rate.

        (8) Multiply (5) by (6) by (7). This is the working capital adjustment. It shall not exceed 4 percent of the contract costs in Block 20.

        (c)

        (1) “No financing” means either that the contract does not provide progress payments or performance-based payments, or that the contract provides them only on a limited basis, such as financing of first articles. Do not compute a working capital adjustment.

        (2) When the contract contains provisions for progress payments, compute a working capital adjustment (Block 25).

        (3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price contract with redetermination provisions as if it were a fixed-price incentive contract with below normal conditions.

        (4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital adjustment.

        (5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values. They shall not receive the working capital adjustment in Block 25. However, they may receive higher than normal values within the designated range to the extent that portions of cost are fixed.

        (6) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments, do not compute a working capital adjustment.

        (d) —(1)  The contracting officer should consider elements that affect contract type risk such as—

        (i) Length of contract;

        (ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;

        (iii) Economic environment;

        (iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;

        (v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions (e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);

        (vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions;

        (vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales (FMS) that are not funded by U.S. appropriations; and

        (viii) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments—

        (A) The frequency of payments;

        (B) The total amount of payments compared to the maximum allowable amount specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); and

        (C) The risk of the payment schedule to the contractor.

        (2)  (i) The contracting officer shall assess the extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the contract action (also see 217.7404-6(a) and 243.204-70-6). When considering the reduced cost risks associated with allowable incurred costs on an undefinitized contract action, it is appropriate to apply separate contract risk factors for allowable incurred costs and estimated costs to complete when completing the contract risk sections of DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines. When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the costs has been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contract action and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal as defined in 217.7401, the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal.

        (ii) Contracting officers shall document in the price negotiation memorandum the reason for assigning a specific contract type risk value, to include the extent to which any reduced cost risk during the undefinitized period of performance was considered, in determining the negotiation objective.

        (3)  The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is substantial contract type risk. Indicators of this are—

        (i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;

        (ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the contractor, particularly when there is considerable economic uncertainty;

        (iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) that place a high degree of risk on the contractor;

        (iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics support arrangements or those made from U.S. Government inventories or stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate that there are substantial risks above those normally present in DoD contracts for similar items; or

        (v) An aggressive performance-based payment schedule that increases risk.

        (4)  The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the contract type risk is low. Indicators of this are—

        (i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;

        (ii) Relative short-term contracts;

        (iii) Contractual provisions that substantially reduce the contractor's risk;

        (iv) Incentive provisions that place a low degree of risk on the contractor;

        (v) Performance-based payments totaling the maximum allowable amount(s) specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); or

        (vi) A performance-based payment schedule that is routine with minimal risk.

        (e)  (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the contractor.

        (2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs excluding facilities capital cost of money), reduced as appropriate when—

        (i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor progress payments liquidated late in period of performance);

        (ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as advance payments; or

        (iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding arrangements.

        (3) The portion that the contractor finances is generally the portion not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100 percent minus the customary progress payment rate (see FAR 32.501). For example, if a contractor receives progress payments at 80 percent, the portion that the contractor finances is 20 percent. On contracts that provide progress payments to small businesses, use the customary progress payment rate for large businesses.

        (f)  (1) This is the period of time that the contractor has a working capital investment in the contract. It—

        (i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete the substantive portion of the work;

        (ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of minimal effort should be excluded;

        (iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option provisions; and

        (iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of performance beyond that required to complete the initial program year's requirements.

        (2) The contracting officer—

        (i) Should use the following table to select the contract length factor;

        (ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the contract has multiple deliveries; and

        (iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a representative result.

        (3) Example: A prospective contract has a performance period of 40 months with end items being delivered in the 34th, 36th, 38th, and 40th months of the contract. The average period is 37 months and the contract length factor is 1.15.

        215.404-71-4   Facilities capital employed.

#### § 215.404-71-4

        (a)  This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It recognizes both the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract performance and the contractor's commitment to improving productivity.

        (b)  The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed using—

        (1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and

        (2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.

        (c)  See PGI 215.404-71-4(c) for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.

        (1)  The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application. It—

        (i) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.

        (ii) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.

        (2)  Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:

        (i) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three displays.

        (ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.

        (iii) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.

        (iv) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly amounts.

        (v) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.

        (d)  To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed as follows:

        (1)  (i)  Use the imputed facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of contract performance.

        (ii)  When measuring the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.

        (2)  Assess and weight the profit objective for risk associated with facilities capital employed in accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71-4.

        (e)  The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has been annotated to explain the process.

        (1) Select a value from the list in paragraph (f) of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (g) of this subsection.

        (2) Use the allocated facilities capital attributable to land, buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.

        (i) In addition to the net book value of facilities capital employed, consider facilities capital that is part of a formal investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable evidence that—

        (A) Achievable benefits to DoD will result from the investment; and

        (B) The benefits of the investment are included in the forward pricing structure.

        (ii) If the value of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at cost (i.e., excluding general and administrative (G&A) expenses and profit), add to the contractor's allocated facilities capital, the allocated facilities capital attributable to the buildings and equipment of those corporate divisions supplying the intracompany transfers. Do not make this addition if the value of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at price (i.e., including G&A expenses and profit).

        (3) Multiply (1) by (2).

        (f)

        (g)  (1) In evaluating facilities capital employed, the contracting officer—

        (i) Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the goods or services being acquired under the prospective contract;

        (ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements and other anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from the facilities capital investment, including—

        (A) The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected contribution to future defense needs; and

        (B) The contractor's level of investment in defense related facilities as compared with the portion of the contractor's total business that is derived from DoD; and

        (iii) Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as termination protection clauses and capital investment indemnification.

        (2)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are—

        (A) New investments in state-of-the-art technology that reduce acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits such as improved product quality or accelerated deliveries; or

        (B) Investments in new equipment for research and development applications.

        (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above normal when there are direct and measurable benefits in efficiency and significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced. Maximum values apply only to those cases where the benefits of the facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.

        (3)  (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has little benefit to DoD. Indicators are—

        (A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial product lines;

        (B) Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home or group level administrative offices, corporate aircraft and hangars, gymnasiums; or

        (C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.

        (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal when a significant portion of defense manufacturing is done in an environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive capital equipment.

        (a) This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).

        (b) To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:

        (1) The contractor's participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;

        (2) Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;

        (3) Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;

        (4) The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology). Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor's cost reduction initiatives over time;

        (5) The contractor's adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;

        (6) Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;

        (7) The contractor's effective incorporation of commercial products or commercial services and commercial processes; or

        (8) The contractor's investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved productivity.

        (c) When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract. However, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.

        215.404-72   Modified weighted guidelines method for nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.

#### § 215.404-72

        (a)  As used in this subpart, a nonprofit organization is a business entity—

        (1) That operates exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes;

        (2) Whose earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or individual;

        (3) Whose activities do not involve influencing legislation or political campaigning for any candidate for public office; and

        (4) That is exempted from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        (b) For nonprofit organizations that are entities that have been identified by the Secretary of Defense or a Secretary of a Department as receiving sustaining support on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis from a particular DoD department or agency, compute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71, with the following modifications:

        (1)  (i) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the standard designated range (see 215.404-71-2(c)), reduce the fee objective by an amount equal to 1 percent of the costs in Block 20 of the DD Form 1547. Show the net (reduced) amount on the DD Form 1547.

        (ii) Do not assign a value from the technology incentive designated range.

        (2)  Use a designated range of −1 percent to 0 percent instead of the values in 215.404-71-3. There is no normal value.

        (c) For all other nonprofit organizations except FFRDCs, compute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71, modified as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection.

        215.404-73   Alternate structured approaches.

#### § 215.404-73

        (a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach under 215.404-4(c).

        (b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the alternate, but it shall include—

        (1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit—performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.

        (2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.

        (i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective by the amount of facilities capital cost of money under Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital (48 CFR 9904.414). Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective. The profit amount in the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.

        (ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk. In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.

#### § 215.404-74

        In developing a fee objective for cost-plus-award-fee contracts, the contracting officer shall—

        (a) Follow the guidance in FAR 16.405-2 and 216.405-2;

        (b) Not use the weighted guidelines method or alternate structured approach;

        (c) Apply the offset policy in 215.404-73(b)(2) for facilities capital cost of money, i.e., reduce the base fee by the amount of facilities capital cost of money; and

        (d) Not complete a DD Form 1547.

#### § 215.404-75

        For nonprofit organizations that are FFRDCs, the contracting officer—

        (a) Should consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations shall include the FFRDC's—

        (1) Proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that relates to DoD contracted effort;

        (2) Facilities capital acquisition plans;

        (3) Working capital funding as assessed on operating cycle cash needs; and

        (4) Provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary to the FFRDC.

        (b) Shall, when a fee is considered appropriate, establish the fee objective in accordance with FFRDC fee policies in the DoD Instruction 5000.77, DoD Federally Funded Research and Development Center Program.

        (c) Shall not use the weighted guidelines method or an alternate structured approach.

#### § 215.407-1

        (c)(i) When a contractor voluntarily discloses defective pricing after contract award, the contracting officer shall discuss the disclosure with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). This discussion will assist in the contracting officer determining the involvement of DCAA, which could be a limited-scope audit ( limited to the affected cost elements of the defective pricing disclosure), a full-scope audit, or technical assistance as appropriate for the circumstances ( nature or dollar amount of the defective pricing disclosure). At a minimum, the contracting officer shall discuss with DCAA the following:

        (A) Completeness of the contractor's voluntary disclosure on the affected contract.

        (B) Accuracy of the contractor's cost impact calculation for the affected contract.

        (C) Potential impact on existing contracts, task or deliver orders, or other proposals the contractor has submitted to the Government.

        (ii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing is not a voluntary refund as defined in 242.7100 and does not waive the Government entitlement to the recovery of any overpayment plus interest on the overpayments in accordance with FAR 15.407-1(b)(7).

        (iii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing does not waive the Government's rights to pursue defective pricing claims on the affected contract or any other Government contract.

        215.407-4   Should-cost review.

#### § 215.407-4

        (a)  See PGI 215.407-4 for guidance on determining whether to perform a program or overhead should-cost review.

        (b)  Major weapon system should-cost program reviews shall be conducted in a manner that is transparent, objective, and provides for the efficiency of the DoD systems acquisition process (section 837 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91)).

        (i) Major weapon system should-cost reviews may include the following features:

        (A) A thorough review of each contributing element of the program cost and the justification for each cost.

        (B) An analysis of non-value added overhead and unnecessary reporting requirements.

        (C) Benchmarking against similar DoD programs, similar commercial programs (where appropriate), and other programs by the same contractor at the same facility.

        (D) An analysis of supply chain management to encourage competition and incentive cost performance at lower tiers.

        (E) A review of how to restructure the program (Government and contractor) team in a streamlined manner, if necessary.

        (F) Identification of opportunities to break out Government-furnished equipment versus prime contractor-furnished materials.

        (G) Identification of items or services contracted through third parties that result in unnecessary pass-through costs.

        (H) Evaluation of ability to use integrated developmental and operational testing and modeling and simulation to reduce overall costs.

        (I) Identification of alternative technology and materials to reduce developmental or lifecycle costs for a program.

        (J) Identification and prioritization of cost savings opportunities.

        (K) Establishment of measurable targets and ongoing tracking systems.

        (ii) The should-cost review shall provide for sufficient analysis while minimizing the impact on program schedule by engaging stakeholders early, relying on information already available before requesting additional data, and establishing a team with the relevant expertise early.

        (iii) The should-cost review team shall be comprised of members, including third-party experts if necessary, with the training, skills, and experience in analysis of cost elements, production or sustainment processes, and technologies relevant to the program under review. The review team may include members from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the department or agency's cost analysis center, and appropriate functional organizations, as necessary.

        (iv) The should-cost review team shall establish a process for communicating and collaborating with the contractor throughout the should-cost review, including notification to the contractor regarding which elements of the contractor's operations will be reviewed and what information will be necessary to perform the review, as soon as practicable, both prior to and during the review.

        (v) The should-cost review team report shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, review of current, accurate, and complete data, and shall identify cost savings opportunities associated with specific engineering or business changes that can be quantified and tracked.

        (1)  The award-fee pool is the total available award fee for each evaluation period for the life of the contract. The contracting officer shall perform an analysis of appropriate fee distribution to ensure at least 40 percent of the award fee is available for the final evaluation so that the award fee is appropriately distributed over all evaluation periods to incentivize the contractor throughout performance of the contract. The percentage of award fee available for the final evaluation may be set below 40 percent if the contracting officer determines that a lower percentage is appropriate, and this determination is approved by the head of the contracting activity (HCA). The HCA may not delegate this approval authority.

        (2)  Award-fee payments other than payments resulting from the evaluation at the end of an award-fee period are prohibited. (This prohibition does not apply to base-fee payments.) The fee-determining official's rating for award-fee evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. The final award-fee payment will be consistent with the fee-determining official's final evaluation of the contractor's overall performance against the cost, schedule, and performance outcomes specified in the award-fee plan.

        (3)

        (i) The cost-plus-award-fee contract shall not be used—

        (A) To avoid—

        () Establishing cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts when the criteria for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts apply; or

        () Developing objective targets so a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract can be used; or

        (B) For either engineering development or operational system development acquisitions that have specifications suitable for simultaneous research and development and production, except a cost-plus-award-fee contract may be used for individual engineering development or operational system development acquisitions ancillary to the development of a major weapon system or equipment, where—

        () It is more advantageous; and

        () The purpose of the acquisition is clearly to determine or solve specific problems associated with the major weapon system or equipment.

        (ii) Do not apply the weighted guidelines method to cost-plus-award-fee contracts for either the base (fixed) fee or the award fee.

        (iii) The base fee shall not exceed three percent of the estimated cost of the contract exclusive of the fee.

#### § 216.601

        (d)  (i)(A)

        ()

        () For contracts (_i_ncluding indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders in which the portion of the requirement performed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis exceeds $1 million, the approval authority for the determination and findings shall be the senior contracting official within the contracting activity. This authority may not be delegated.

        () For contracts (including indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders in which the portion of the requirement performed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis is less than or equal to $1 million, the determination and findings shall be approved one level above the contracting officer.

        ()  The authority of the head of the contracting activity to approve the determination and findings may not be delegated.

        ()  The approval requirements in paragraphs (d)(i)(A)() and () of this section do not apply to contracts that, as determined by the head of the contracting activity—

        () Address why a cost-plus-fixed-fee term or other cost-reimbursement, incentive, or fixed-price contract or order is not appropriate; for contracts (including indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders for other than commercial products or commercial services awarded to contractors with adequate accounting systems, a cost-plus-fixed-fee term contract type shall be preferred over a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract type;

        () Establish that the requirement has been structured to minimize the use of time-and-materials and labor-hour requirements ( limiting the value or length of the time-and-materials or labor-hour portion of the contract or order; establishing fixed prices for portions of the requirement); and

        () Describe the actions planned to minimize the use of time-and-materials and labor-hour contracts on future acquisitions for the same requirements.

        (C)  For indefinite-delivery contracts, the contracting officer shall structure contracts that authorize time-and-materials orders or labor-hour orders to also authorize orders on a cost-reimbursement, incentive, or fixed-price basis, to the maximum extent practicable.

        (e)  Use the provision at FAR 52.216-29, Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Other Than Commercial Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition, with 252.216-7002, Alternate A, in solicitations contemplating the use of a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract type for other than commercial products or commercial services if the price is expected to be based on adequate competition.

        217.170   General.

#### § 217.170

        (a) Before awarding a multiyear contract, the head of the agency must compare the cost of that contract to the cost of an annual procurement approach, using a present value analysis. Do not award the multiyear contract unless the analysis shows that the multiyear contract will result in the lower cost (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(7); section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).

        (b) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the congressional defense committees at least 30 days before termination of any multiyear contract (section 8010 of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).

        (c) Every multiyear contract must comply with FAR 17.104(c), unless an exception is approved through the budget process in coordination with the cognizant comptroller.

        (d)(1) DoD must provide notification to the congressional defense committees at least 30 days before entering into a multiyear contract for certain procurements, including those expected to—

        (i) Employ an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20 million (see 10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(1), 10 U.S.C. 3531(d)(1), and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts);

        (ii) Employ economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 million in any one year of the contract (see 10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(1) and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts);

        (iii) Involve a contract for advance procurement leading to a multiyear contract that employs economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 million in any one year (see  10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(1) and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts); or

L. 105-56).

        (3) If the advisability of using a multiyear contract becomes apparent too late to satisfy the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the request for authority to enter into a multiyear contract must be—

        (i) Formally submitted by the President as a budget amendment; or

        (ii) Made by the Secretary of Defense, in writing, to the congressional defense committees (see section 8008(b) of Pub. L. 105-56).

        (4) Agencies must establish reporting procedures to meet the congressional notification requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The head of the agency must submit a copy of each notice to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (DPCAP), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (OUSD(A&S)), and to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (Program/Budget) (OUSD(C)(P/B)).

        (5) If the budget for a contract that contains a cancellation ceiling in excess of $150 million does not include proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract—

        (i) The notification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall include—

        (A) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;

        (B) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and

        (C) A financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 3501(g) and 10 U.S.C. 3531(d)); and

        217.171   Multiyear contracts for services.

#### § 217.171

        (a) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following types of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 3531(a)). Covered services are—

        (1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;

        (2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;

        (3) Specialized training requiring high-quality instructor skills ( training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);

        (4) Base services ( ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and

        (5) Environmental remediation services for—

        (i) An active military installation;

        (ii) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or

        (iii) A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 3531(b)).

        (b) The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:

        (1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment. As used in this section, “useful commercial life” means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.

        (2) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.

        (3) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 3531(c)).

        (c) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that—

        (1) There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;

        (2) Furnishing the services will require—

        (i) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or

        (ii) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and

        (3) Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 3531(a)).

        (d) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds $750 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 3531(d)(2)).

#### § 217.172

        (a) This section applies to all multiyear contracts for supplies, including weapon systems and other multiyear acquisitions specifically authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 3501).

        (b) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for supplies if, in addition to the conditions listed in FAR 17.105-1(b), the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States (10 U.S.C. 3501(a)(6)).

        (c) Multiyear contracts in amounts exceeding $750 million must be specifically authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(1)).

        (d) The head of the agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for any system (or component thereof) if the value of the multiyear contract would exceed $750 million unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(3)).

        (e) The head of the agency shall not enter into a multiyear contract unless—

        (1) The Secretary of Defense has submitted to Congress a budget request for full funding of units to be procured through the contract;

        (2) In the case of a contract for procurement of aircraft, the budget request includes full funding of procurement funds for production beyond advance procurement activities of aircraft units to be produced in the fiscal year covered by the budget;

        (3) Cancellation provisions in the contract do not include consideration of recurring manufacturing costs of the contractor associated with the production of unfunded units to be delivered under the contract;

        (4) The contract provides that payments to the contractor under the contract shall not be made in advance of incurred costs on funded units; and

        (5) The contract does not provide for a price adjustment based on a failure to award a follow-on contract (section 8010 of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).

        (f)(1) The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear contract that exceeds $750 million (when entered into or extended) until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(5)).

        (2) In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $750 million, the head of the contracting activity must determine that the conditions required by paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance with the Secretary's certification and determination required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

        (g) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for—

        (2) Advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to manufacture a weapon system, including advance procurement to achieve economic lot purchases or more efficient production rates (see paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section regarding economic order quantity procurements) (10 U.S.C. 3501(h)(2)). Before initiating an advance procurement, the contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy ( the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation).

        (h) The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfied before awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:

        (1) The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency's budget estimate submission and the President's budget request.

        (2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than 30 days before entry into such contracts, that each of the conditions in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)).

        (i) The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in FAR 17.105-1, paragraphs (b)(1) through (5), will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(A)).

        (ii) The Secretary's determination under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by the Defense Cost and Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supports the findings (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(B)).

        (iii) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 4371(a)(3) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(C)).

        (iv) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(D)).

        (v) Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract is to be awarded to perform the contract, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(E)).

        (vi) The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(F)).

        (vii) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(G)). The head of the agency shall submit to OUSD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency's determination that this requirement has been met.

        (viii) The head of the agency shall submit information supporting this certification to OUSD(C)(P/B)& for transmission to Congress through the Secretary of Defense.

        (A) The head of the agency shall, as part of this certification, give written notification to the congressional defense committees of—

        () The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;

        () The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and

        () A financial risk assessment of not including the budgeting for costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. _3_501(g)); and

        (B) The head of the agency shall provide copies of the notification to the Office of Management and Budget at least 14 days before contract award.

        (3) The contract is for the procurement of a complete and usable end item (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(5)(A)).

        (4) Funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement are obligated only for the procurement of those long-lead items that are necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(5)(B)).

        (5) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(6)).

        (6) The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section to an official below the level of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(7)).

        (7) All other requirements of law are met and there are no other statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific system or component. One such restriction may be the achievement of specified cost savings. If the agency finds, after negotiations with the contractor(s), that the specified savings cannot be achieved, the head of the agency shall assess the savings that, nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract. If the savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from the law's specific savings requirement (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(4)). The request shall—

        (i) Quantify the savings that can be achieved;

        (ii) Explain any other benefits to the Government of using the multiyear contract;

        (iii) Include details regarding the negotiated contract terms and conditions; and

        (iv) Be submitted to OUSD(A&S)(DPCAP) for transmission to Congress via the Secretary of Defense and the President.

        (i) The Secretary of Defense may instruct the head of the agency proposing a multiyear contract to include in that contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the life of the contract (10 U.S.C. 3501(j)).

        (j) Any requests for increased funding or reprogramming for procurement of a major system under a multiyear contract shall be accompanied by an explanation of how the request for increased funding affects the determinations made by the Secretary of Defense under 217.172(h)(2) (10 U.S.C. 3501(m)).

        (2) For the new items with the exchange (trade-in allowance) for the exchange property listed.

        (b) The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange basis. If the lowest evaluated offer is an offer for the new items without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis and forgo the exchange.

        (c) Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror. When the successful offer includes an exchange, award one contract for both the acquisition of the new property and the trade-in of the exchange property. The only exception is when the items must be acquired against a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a separate contract for the exchange.

        217.7005   Solicitation provision.

#### § 217.7005

        Use the provision at 252.217-7002, Offering Property for Exchange, when offering nonexcess personal property for exchange. Allow a minimum of 14 calendar days for the inspection period in paragraph (b) of the clause if the exchange property is in the contiguous United States. Allow at least 21 calendar days outside the contiguous United States.

        217.7301   Policy.

#### § 217.7301

        Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.

        217.7302   Procedures.

#### § 217.7302

        (a) Whenever practicable, include a requirement for contractor identification of sources of supply in all contracts for the delivery of supplies. The identification shall include—

        (1) The item's actual manufacturer or producer, or all the contractor's sources for the item;

        (2) The item's national stock number (if there is one);

        (3) The item identification number used by—

        (i) The actual manufacturer or producer of the item; or

        (ii) Each of the contractor's sources for the item; and

        (4) The source of any technical data delivered under the contract.

        (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to contracts that are—

        (1) For commercial products; or

        (2) Valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

> [56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 64 FR 2597, Jan. 15, 1999; 88 FR 6583, Jan. 31, 2023]

        217.7303   Solicitation provision.

#### § 217.7303

        (a) Use the provision at 252.217-7026, Identification of Sources of Supply, or one substantially the same, in all solicitations for supplies when the acquisition is being conducted under other than full and open competition, except when—

        (1) Using FAR 6.302-5;

        (2) The contracting officer already has the information required by the provision (e.g., the information was obtained under other acquisitions);

        (3) The contract is for subsistence, clothing or textiles, fuels, or supplies purchased and used outside the United States;

        (4) The contracting officer determines that it would not be practicable to require offerors/contractors to provide the information, e.g., nonrepetitive local purchases; or

        (5) The contracting officer determines that the exception at 217.7302(b) applies to all items under the solicitation.

        (b) If appropriate, use the provision at 252.217-7026, Identification of Sources of Supply, or one substantially the same, in service contracts requiring the delivery of supplies.

        (2) It includes task orders and delivery orders.

        (3) It does not include change orders, administrative changes, funding modifications, or any other contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract,  engineering change proposals, value engineering change proposals, and over and above work requests as described in subpart 217.77. For policy relating to definitization of change orders, see 243.204-70.

        (1) Purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (2) Special access programs.

        (3) Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement contracts.

        (2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.

        (b) Be as complete and definite as practicable under the particular circumstances.

        217.7404   Limitations.

#### § 217.7404

        See PGI 217.7404 for additional guidance on obtaining approval to authorize use of an undefinitized contact action, documentation requirements, and other limitations on their use.

        (a)

        (1) A contracting officer may not enter into a UCA for a foreign military sale unless—

        (i) The UCA provides for agreement upon contractual terms, specifications, and price by the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submits a qualifying proposal; and

        (ii) The contracting officer obtains approval from the head of the contracting activity to enter into a UCA in accordance with 217.7404-1.

        (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a waiver is necessary in order to support any of the following operations:

        (i) A contingency operation.

        (ii) A humanitarian or peacekeeping operation.

#### § 217.7404-1

        The contracting officer shall obtain approval from the head of the contracting activity before—

        (a) Entering into a UCA. The request for approval must fully explain the need to begin performance before definitization, including the adverse impact on agency requirements resulting from delays in beginning performance.

        (b) Including requirements for non-urgent spare parts and support equipment in a UCA. The request should show that inclusion of the non-urgent items is consistent with good business practices and in the best interest of the United States.

        (c) Modifying the scope of a UCA when performance has already begun. The request should show that the modification is consistent with good business practices and in the best interests of the United States.

If the contractor does not submit a qualifying proposal in accordance with the contract definitization schedule, notwithstanding FAR 52.216-26, Payments of Allowable Costs Before Definitization, the contracting officer may withhold an amount necessary to protect the interests of the Government, not to exceed 5 percent of all subsequent financing requests, or take other appropriate actions (e.g., documenting the noncompliance in the contractor's past performance evaluation or terminating the contract for default).

        (2) Contracting officers shall document in the contract file the justification for withholding or not withholding payments if the qualifying proposal was not submitted in accordance with the contract definitization schedule.

        (a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred during contract performance before negotiation of the final price. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize a UCA, and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal, the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal;

#### § 217.7505

        This section provides implementing guidance for section 1215 of Public Law 98-94 (10 U.S.C. 2452 note).

        (a) The contracting officer shall not award, on a sole source basis, a contract for any centrally managed replenishment part when the price of the part has increased by 25 percent or more over the most recent 12-month period.

        (1) Before computing the percentage difference between the current price and the prior price, adjust for quantity, escalation, and other factors necessary to achieve comparability.

        (2) Departments and agencies may specify an alternate percentage or percentages for contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (b) The contracting officer may award a contract for a part, the price of which exceeds the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, if the contracting officer certifies in writing to the head of the contracting activity before award that—

        (1) The contracting officer has evaluated the price of the part and concluded that the price increase is fair and reasonable; or

        (2) The national security interests of the United States require purchase of the part despite the price increase.

        (c) The fact that a particular price has not exceeded the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section does not relieve the contracting officer of the responsibility for obtaining a fair and reasonable price.

        (d) Contracting officers may include a provision in sole source solicitations requiring that the offeror supply with its proposal, price and quantity data on any government orders for the replenishment part issued within the most recent 12 months.

        219.702-70   Statutory requirements for the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans.

#### § 219.702-70

        (a)  In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637 note, DoD has established a test program to determine whether comprehensive subcontracting plans on a corporate, division, or plant-wide basis will reduce administrative burdens while enhancing subcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. This program is referred to as the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (Test Program).

        (b)  To become and remain eligible to participate in the Test Program, a business concern is required to have furnished supplies or services (including construction) under at least three DoD contracts during the preceding fiscal year, having an aggregate value of at least $100 million.

        (c)  (1) The Defense Contract Management Agency will designate the contracting officer who shall negotiate and approve comprehensive subcontracting plans with eligible participants on an annual basis.

        (2) Test Program participants use their comprehensive subcontracting plans, in lieu of individual subcontracting plans, when performing any DoD contract or subcontract that requires a subcontracting plan.

        (d)  The contracting officer designated to manage the comprehensive subcontracting plan shall conduct a compliance review during the fiscal year after the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable. The contracting officer shall compare the approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the comprehensive subcontracting plan.

        (1) If the contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, permitting the contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period at the contracting officer's discretion) within which to respond. The contracting officer may take the contractor's failure to respond to the notice as an admission that no valid explanation exists.

        (2) The contracting officer shall review all available information to determine whether the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan.

        (3) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the contracting officer determines that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision. The contracting officer's final decision shall include the right of the contractor to appeal under the Disputes clause. The contracting officer shall distribute a copy of the final decision to all cognizant contracting officers for the contracts covered under the plan.

        (e)  The amount of liquidated damages shall be the amount of anticipated damages sustained by the Government, including but not limited to additional expenses of administration, reporting, and contract monitoring, and shall be identified in the comprehensive subcontracting plan. Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies the Government may have.

        (f)  The Test Program expires on December 31, 2017.

However, the SBA remains the prime contractor on all 8(a) contracts, continues to determine eligibility of concerns for contract award, and retains appeal rights under FAR 19.810. The SBA delegates only the authority to sign contracts on its behalf. Consistent with the provisions of the PA, this authority is hereby redelegated to DoD contracting officers.

        (a) When a contractor is unable to deliver urgent and critical items because of a work stoppage at its facility, the contracting officer, before removing any items from the facility, shall—

        (i) Before initiating any action, contact the labor advisor to obtain the opinion of the national office of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or other mediation agency regarding the effect movement of the items would have on labor negotiations.

      Subpart 222.4—Labor Standards for Contracts Involving Construction

        222.402   Applicability.

#### § 222.402

        222.402-70   Installation support contracts.

#### § 222.402-70

        (a) Apply both the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute to installation support contracts if—

        (1) The contract is principally for services but also requires a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repair work; and

        (2) The aggregate dollar value of such construction work exceeds or is expected to exceed $2,000.

        (b)  Contract installation support requirements, such as plant operation and installation services (i.e., custodial, snow removal, etc.) are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards. Apply Service Contract Labor Standards clauses and minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements to all contract service calls or orders for such maintenance and support work.

        (c)  Contract construction, alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. Apply Construction Wage Rate Requirements clauses and minimum wage requirements to all contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.

        (d)  Some contract work may be characterized as either Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs or Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance. For example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a wall could be covered by either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements or the Service Contract Labor Standards. In those instances where a contract service call or order requires construction trade skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear whether the work required is Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance or Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs, apply the following rules:

        (1) Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 32 or more work hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements.

        (2) Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 32 work hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards.

        (3) Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute regardless of the total work hours required.

        (e) The determination of labor standards application shall be made at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be made at the time the service call or order is placed against the contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work required.

        (f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.

#### § 223.7302

        223.7303   Prohibition.

#### § 223.7303

        (a) Except as provided in 223.7304 and 223.7305, no contract may include a specification or standard that results in a deliverable or construction material containing more than 0.1 percent hexavalent chromium by weight in any homogeneous material in the deliverable or construction material where proven substitutes are available that provide acceptable performance for the application.

        (b) This prohibition is in addition to any imposed by the Clean Air Act regardless of the place of performance.

        223.7304   Exceptions.

#### § 223.7304

        The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to—

        (a) Legacy systems and their related parts, subsystems, and components that already contain hexavalent chromium. However, alternatives to hexavalent chromium shall be considered by the appropriate official during system modifications, follow-on procurements of legacy systems, or maintenance procedure updates; and

        (b) Additional sustainment related contracts (e.g., parts, services) for a system in which use of hexavalent chromium was previously approved.

        223.7305   Authorization and approval.

#### § 223.7305

        (a) The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to critical defense applications if no substitute can meet performance requirements. The DoD policy of April 8, 2009, “Minimizing the Use of Hexavalent Chromium,” contains requirements for weighing hexavalent chromium versus substitutes. DoD Program Managers must consider the following factors—

        (1) Cost effectiveness of alternative materials or processes;

        (2) Technical feasibility of alternative materials or processes;

        (3) Environment, safety, and occupational health risks associated with the use of the hexavalent chromium or substitute materials in each specific application;

        (4) Achieving a DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level of at least eight for any qualified alternative;

        (5) Materiel availability of hexavalent chromium and the proposed alternatives over the projected life span of the system; and

        (6) Corrosion performance difference of alternative materials or processes as determined by agency corrosion subject matter experts.

        (b) However, unless an exception in 223.7304 applies, the incorporation of hexavalent chromium in items acquired by DoD shall be specifically authorized at a level no lower than a general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service from the Program Executive Office or equivalent level, in coordination with the component Corrosion Control and Prevention Executive. Follow the procedures in PGI 223.7305.

        225.101   General.

#### § 225.101

        (a) For DoD, the following two-part test determines whether a manufactured end product is a domestic end product:

        (i) The end product is manufactured in the United States; and

        (ii)(A) Except for an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components exceeds 60 percent of the cost of all its components, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar year 2029, but see paragraph (d) of this section. This test is applied to end products only and not to individual components.

        (B) For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country must constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product. The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, excluding commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) fasteners. The domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.

        (c) Additional exceptions that allow the purchase of foreign end products are listed at 225.103.

        (d)(1) In lieu of the threshold increases in FAR 25.101(a)(2)(i), use the domestic content threshold increases in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section. The senior procurement executive may approve application of an alternate domestic content test, under which the domestic content threshold in effect at the time of contract award will apply to the entire period of performance of the contract, following consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's Made in America Office. See PGI 225.101 for guidance on documentation requirements when the senior procurement executive approves application of an alternate domestic content test.

        (2) When the senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for the contract pursuant to FAR 25.101(d)(1) (but see paragraph (d)(1) of this section)—

        (A) See 225.1101(2)(iv) for use of alternate II of the clause at 252.225-7001, Buy American and Balance of Payments Program;

        (B) See 225.1101(2)(v) for use of alternate III of the clause at 252.225-7001, Buy American and Balance of Payments Program;

        (C) See 225.1101(9) for use of the basic or alternate provision at 252.225-7035, Buy American—Free Trade Agreements—Balance of Payments Program Certificate, or the basic or alternate clause at 252.225-7036, Buy American—Free Trade Agreements—Balance of Payments Program; and

        (D) See 225.1101(10)(i) for use of the basic or alternate clause at 252.225-7036, Buy American—Free Trade Agreements—Balance of Payments Program.

        225.103   Exceptions.

#### § 225.103

        (a)(i)(A) Public interest exceptions for certain countries are in 225.872.

        (B) For procurements covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) has determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American statute to end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.

        (ii)(A) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in subpart 225.5, but consider recommending a public interest exception if the purposes of the Buy American statute are not served, or in order to meet a need set forth in 10 U.S.C. 4861. For example, a public interest exception may be appropriate—

        () If accepting the low domestic offer will involve substantial foreign expenditures, or accepting the low foreign offer will involve substantial domestic expenditures;

        () To ensure access to advanced state-of-the-art commercial technology; or

        () To maintain the same source of supply for spare and replacement parts (also see paragraph (b)(iii)(B) of this section)—

        () For an end _i_tem that qualifies as a domestic end product; or

        () In order not to impair integration of the military and commercial industrial base.

        (B) Except as provided in PGI 225.872-4, process a determination for a public interest exception after consideration of the factors in 10 U.S.C. 4861—

        () At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;

        () By the head of the contracting activity for acquisitions with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than $1.5 million; or

        () By the agency head for acquisitions valued at $1.5 million or more.

        (b)(i) A determination that an article, material, or supply is not reasonably available is required when domestic offers are insufficient to meet the requirement and award is to be made on other than a qualifying country or eligible end product.

        (ii) A determination is not required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content. Except as provided in FAR 25.103(b)(3), the determination shall be approved—

        (A) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;

        (B) By the chief of the contracting office for acquisitions with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than $1.5 million; or

        (C) By the head of the contracting activity or immediate deputy for acquisitions valued at $1.5 million or more.

        (iii) A separate determination as to whether an article is reasonably available is not required for the following articles. DoD has already determined that these articles are not reasonably available from domestic sources:

        (A) Spare or replacement parts that must be acquired from the original foreign manufacturer or supplier.

        (B) Foreign drugs acquired by the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, when the Director, Pharmaceuticals Group, Directorate of Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug will fulfill the requirements.

        (iv) Under coordinated acquisition (see Subpart 208.70), the determination is the responsibility of the requiring department when the requiring department specifies acquisition of a foreign end product.

        (c) The cost of a domestic end product is unreasonable if it is not the low evaluated offer when evaluated under subpart 225.5.

#### § 225.401

        (a)(2)(A) If a department or agency considers an individual acquisition of a product to be indispensable for national security or national defense purposes and appropriate for exclusion from the provisions of FAR subpart 25.4, it may submit a request with supporting rationale to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (DPCAP), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (OUSD(A&S)DPCAP). Approval by OUSD(A&S)DPCAP is not required if—

        () Purchase from foreign sources is restricted by statute (see subpart 225.70);

        () Another exception in FAR _2_5.401 applies to the acquisition; or

If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.

        (A) Not received; or

        (B) Insufficient to fill the Government's requirements. In this case, accept all responsive, responsible offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, and eligible products before accepting any other offers;

        (A) The head of the contracting activity may approve a national interest waiver for a purchase by an overseas purchasing activity, if the waiver is supported by a written statement from the requiring activity that the products being acquired are critical for the support of U.S. forces stationed abroad.

        (B) The Commander or Director, Defense Energy Support Center, may approve national interest waivers for purchases of fuel for use by U.S. forces overseas; or

        (iii) The acquisition is in support of operations in Afghanistan (see 225.7704-1).

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 15620, Mar. 31, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

        225.502   Application.

#### § 225.502

        (a) Whenever the acquisition is in support of operations in Afghanistan, treat the offers of end products from South Caucasus or Central and South Asian states listed in 225.401-70 the same as qualifying country offers.

        (b) Use the following procedures instead of the procedures in FAR 25.502(b) for acquisitions subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement:

        (i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 225.7703-1.

        (ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.

        (c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) for acquisitions subject to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program:

        (i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end products are exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.

        (B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country are also exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, but see 225.106.

        (ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following procedures:

        (A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.

        (B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the low offer (see example in PGI 225.504(1)).

        (C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, award on that offer. If the low offer is a qualifying country offer from a country listed at 225.872-1(b), execute a determination in accordance with 225.872-4. A qualifying country offer is subject to the domestic content requirement for end products that are wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both.

        (D) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is not exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, and there is another foreign offer that is exempt and is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in PGI 225.504(2)).

        (E) Otherwise, apply the 50 percent evaluation factor to the low foreign offer.

        () If the price of the low domestic offer is less than the evaluated price of the low foreign offer, award on the low domestic offer (see example in PGI 225.504(3)).

        () If the evaluated price of the low foreign offer remains less than the low domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in PGI _2_25.504(4)).

        (iii) If price is not the determining factor, use the following procedures:

        (A) If there are domestic offers, apply the 50 percent Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor to all foreign offers unless an exemption applies.

        (B) Evaluate in accordance with the criteria of the solicitation.

        (C) If these procedures will not result in award on a domestic offer, reevaluate offers without the 50 percent factor. If this will result in award on an offer to which the Buy American statute or Balance of Payments Program applies, but evaluation in accordance with paragraph (c)(ii) of this section would result in award on a domestic offer, proceed with award only after execution of a determination in accordance with 225.103(a)(ii)(B), that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.

        (iv) If the solicitation includes the provision at 252.225-7023, Preference for Products or Services from Afghanistan, use the evaluation procedures at 225.7703-3.

In accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a)(1)(ii), the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data from the offeror, to the extent necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price.

        (i) No further approval is required to request data other than certified cost or pricing data from the Canadian Commercial Corporation in the following circumstances:

        (ii) In any circumstances other than those specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the contracting officer shall only require data other than certified cost or pricing data from the Canadian Commercial Corporation if the head of the contracting activity, or designee no lower than two levels above the contracting officer, determines that data other than certified cost or pricing data are needed (or in the case of modifications that it is reasonably certain that data other than certified cost or pricing data will be needed) in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable) (see FAR 15.403-3(a).

        (5) As specified in FAR 15.403-3(a)(4), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data that the contracting officer has deemed necessary to determine price reasonableness or cost realism is ineligible for award, unless the head of the contracting activity determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:

        (i) The effort made to obtain the data.

        (ii) The need for the item or service.

        (iii) Increased cost or significant harm to the Government if award is not made.

        (a) Except for items developed under the U.S./Canadian Development Sharing Program, use the criteria for soliciting and awarding contracts to small business concerns under FAR Part 19 without regard to whether there are potential qualifying country sources for the end product. Do not consider an offer of a qualifying country end product if the solicitation is identified for the exclusive participation of small business concerns.

        (b) Send solicitations directly to qualifying country sources. Solicit Canadian sources through the Canadian Commercial Corporation in accordance with 225.870.

        (c) Use international air mail if solicitation destinations are outside the United States and security classification permits such use.

        (d) If unusual technical or security requirements preclude the acquisition of otherwise acceptable defense equipment from qualifying country sources, review the need for such requirements. Do not impose unusual technical or security requirements solely for the purpose of precluding the acquisition of defense equipment from qualifying countries.

        (e) Do not automatically exclude qualifying country sources from submitting offers because their supplies have not been tested and evaluated by the department or agency.

        (1) Consider the adequacy of qualifying country service testing on a case-by-case basis. Departments or agencies that must limit solicitations to sources whose items have been tested and evaluated by the department or agency shall consider supplies from qualifying country sources that have been tested and accepted by the qualifying country for service use.

        (2) The department or agency may perform a confirmatory test, if necessary.

        (3) Apply U.S. test and evaluation standards, policies, and procedures when the department or agency decides that confirmatory tests of qualifying country end products are necessary.

        (4) If it appears that these provisions might adversely delay service programs, obtain the concurrence of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment), before excluding the qualifying country source from consideration.

        (f) Permit industry representatives from a qualifying country to attend symposia, program briefings, prebid conferences (see FAR 14.207 and 15.201(c)), and similar meetings that address U.S. defense equipment needs and requirements. When practical, structure these meetings to allow attendance by representatives of qualifying country concerns.

        (b) Follow the contract administration procedures at PGI 225.872-5(b).

        (6) End items containing a minimal amount of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals ( specialty metals not melted or produced in the United States that are not covered by another exception listed in this paragraph (b)), if the total weight of noncompliant specialty metal does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty metal in the end item. This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing specialty metals. See PGI 225.7003-3(b)(6) for a table of applicability of specialty metals restrictions to magnets.

        (c)  The restrictions at 225.7003-2(a) do not apply to an item acquired under a prime contract if—

        (1) The offeror has certified, and subsequently demonstrates, that the offeror and its subcontractor(s) will individually or collectively enter into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase a sufficient quantity of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in accordance with the provision at 252.225-7010; and

        (2) The USD(A&S), or the Secretary of the military department concerned, determines that the item is a commercial derivative military article (defense agencies see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(c)). The contracting officer shall submit the offeror's certification and a request for a determination to the appropriate official, through agency channels, and shall notify the offeror when a decision has been made.

        (d)  The USD(A&S) may waive the restrictions at 225.7003-2 if the USD(A&S) determines in writing that acceptance of the item is necessary to the national security interests of the United States ( procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(d). This authority may not be delegated.

        (1) The written determination of the USD(A&S)—

        (i) Shall specify the quantity of end items to which the national security waiver applies;

        (ii) Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and

        (iii) Shall be provided to the congressional defense committees before the determination is executed, except that in the case of an urgent national security requirement, the determination may be provided to the congressional defense committees up to 7 days after it is executed.

        (2) After making such a determination, the USD(A&S) will—

        (i) Ensure that the contractor or subcontractor responsible for the noncompliant specialty metal develops and implements an effective plan to ensure future compliance; and

        (ii) Determine whether or not the noncompliance was knowing and willful. If the USD(A&S) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.

        (3) Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.

        (b)  The waiver criteria at paragraph (c) of this section apply, except that the USD(A&S) may delegate the authority to waive a restriction for a star tracker for a particular foreign country to the service acquisition executive, without power of redelegation (section 1603, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Pub. L. 116-283)).

        (c)  The restrictions on certain foreign purchases at 225.7004-2 may be waived, except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as follows:

        (1)(i) USD(A&S), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination that—

        (A) U.S. producers of the item would not be jeopardized by competition from a foreign country, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country; or

        (B) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items under 225.872, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country.

        (ii) A notice of the determination to exercise the waiver authority shall be published in the  and submitted to the congressional defense committees at least 15 days before the effective date of the waiver.

        (iii) The effective period of the waiver shall not exceed 1 year.

        (B) Options for the procurement of items that are exercised after the effective date of the waiver, if the option prices are adjusted for any reason other than the application of the waiver.

        (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of the following applies:

        (i) The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.

        (ii) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the national technology and industrial base are not available.

        (iii) Application of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source for the item in the national technology and industrial base.

        (iv) Application of the restriction is not in the national security interests of the United States.

        (v) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.

        (3) A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs. The cost of an item of national technology and industrial base origin is unreasonable if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of items that are not of national technology and industrial base origin.

        (i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer's purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. ().

        (ii) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.

        (iii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.

        (iv) Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition. FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.

        (4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).

        (b) Costs not allowable under FAR part 31 are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section.

        (c) The limitations for all contractors described in 231.205-18(c)(iii) and (iv) do not apply to FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5. The allowability of independent research and development (IR&D) costs and bid and proposal (B&P) costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable share of the contractor's total IR&D expenditures and total B&P expenditures. In pricing contracts for such FMS—

        (1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and

        (2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.

        (d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export Control Act.

        (e) The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to FMS contracts.

        225.7303-3   Government-to-government agreements.

#### § 225.7303-3

        If a government-to-government agreement between the United States and a foreign government for the sale, coproduction, or cooperative logistic support of a specifically defined weapon system, major end item, or support item, contains language in conflict with the provisions of this section, the language of the government-to-government agreement prevails.

        225.7303-4   Contingent fees.

#### § 225.7303-4

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, contingent fees are generally allowable under DoD contracts, provided—

        (1) The fees are paid to a bona fide employee or a bona fide established commercial or selling agency maintained by the prospective contractor for the purpose of securing business (see FAR Part 31 and FAR Subpart 3.4); and

        (2) The contracting officer determines that the fees are fair and reasonable.

        (b)(1) Under DoD 5105.38-M, LOAs for requirements for the governments of Australia, Taiwan, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand, or Venezuela (Air Force) shall provide that all U.S. Government contracts resulting from the LOAs prohibit the reimbursement of contingent fees as an allowable cost under the contract, unless the contractor identifies the payments and the foreign customer approves the payments in writing before contract award (see 225.7307(a)).

        (2) For FMS to countries not listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection, contingent fees exceeding $50,000 per FMS case are unallowable under DoD contracts, unless the contractor identifies the payment and the foreign customer approves the payment in writing before contract award.

#### § 225.7303-5

        (a) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2762(d), price FMS wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis on the same costing basis with regard to profit, overhead, IR&D/B&P, and other costing elements as is applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.

        (b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign customer's additional or unique requirements are allowable under such contracts. Indirect burden rates applicable to such direct costs are permitted at the same rates applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.

        (c) A U.S. defense contractor may not recover costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed with funds made available on a nonrepayable basis.

        225.7304   FMS customer involvement.

#### § 225.7304

        (a) FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such cases, FAR 6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full and open competition. The FMS customer may also request that a subcontract be placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such requests from the FMS customer only if the LOA or other written direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3.

        (b) FMS customers should be encouraged to participate with U.S. Government acquisition personnel in discussions with industry to—

        (1) Develop technical specifications;

        (2) Establish delivery schedules;

        (3) Identify any special warranty provisions or other requirements unique to the FMS customer; and

        (4) Review prices of varying alternatives, quantities, and options needed to make price-performance tradeoffs.

        (c) Do not disclose to the FMS customer any data, including certified cost or pricing data, that is contractor proprietary unless the contractor authorizes its release.

        (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the degree of FMS customer participation in contract negotiations is left to the discretion of the contracting officer after consultation with the contractor. The contracting officer shall provide an explanation to the FMS customer if its participation in negotiations will be limited. Factors that may limit FMS customer participation include situations where—

        (1) The contract includes requirements for more than one FMS customer;

        (2) The contract includes unique U.S. requirements; or

        (3) Contractor proprietary data is a subject of negotiations.

        (e) Do not allow representatives of the FMS customer to—

        (1) Direct the exclusion of certain firms from the solicitation process (they may suggest the inclusion of certain firms);

        (2) Interfere with a contractor's placement of subcontracts; or

        (3) Observe or participate in negotiations between the U.S. Government and the contractor involving certified cost or pricing data, unless a deviation is granted in accordance with subpart 201.4.

        (f) Do not accept directions from the FMS customer on source selection decisions or contract terms (except that, upon timely notice, the contracting officer may attempt to obtain any special contract provisions, warranties, or other unique requirements requested by the FMS customer).

        (g) Do not honor any requests by the FMS customer to reject any bid or proposal.

        (h) If an FMS customer requests additional data concerning FMS contract prices, the contracting officer shall, after consultation with the contractor, provide sufficient data to demonstrate the reasonableness of the price and reasonable responses to relevant questions concerning contract price. This data—

        (1) May include tailored responses, top-level pricing summaries, historical prices, or an explanation of any significant differences between the actual contract price and the estimated contract price included in the initial LOA; and

        (2) May be provided orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.

#### § 225.7305

        Advise the contractor when the foreign customer will assume the risk for loss or damage under the appropriate limitation of liability clause(s) (see FAR Subpart 46.8). Consider the costs of necessary insurance, if any, obtained by the contractor to cover the risk of loss or damage in establishing the FMS contract price.

#### § 225.7306

        In accordance with the Presidential policy statement of April 16, 1990, DoD does not encourage, enter into, or commit U.S. firms to FMS offset arrangements.

A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that—

      () Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or

      () It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American statute; or

      (B) The end product is a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item; or

      (2) For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, an end product manufactured in the United States, if the cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product (produced in the United States or a qualifying country means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States or a qualifying country, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives). The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, excluding COTS fasteners. Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the end product contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such end product is calculated in accordance with the explanation of cost of components in paragraph (1)(ii)(A) of this definition.

      means, instead of the definition in FAR 25.003—

      (1) A foreign end product that—

      (i) Is in a category listed in 225.401-70; and

      (ii) Is not subject to discriminatory treatment, due to the applicability of a trade agreement to a particular acquisition;

      (2) A foreign construction material that is not subject to discriminatory treatment, due to the applicability of a trade agreement to a particular acquisition; or

      (3) A foreign service that is not subject to discriminatory treatment, due to the applicability of a trade agreement to a particular acquisition.

      means any concern other than a domestic concern.

      does not include Oman.

      means a country other than the United States or a qualifying country.

      means a component mined, produced, or manufactured in a nonqualifying country.

      means a country with a reciprocal defense procurement memorandum of understanding or international agreement with the United States in which both countries agree to remove barriers to purchases of supplies produced in the other country or services performed by sources of the other country, and the memorandum or agreement complies, where applicable, with the requirements of section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776) and with 10 U.S.C. 2457. Accordingly, the following are qualifying countries:

      means a component mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.

      means—

      (1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in a qualifying country; or

      (2) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if— :

      (i) The cost of the following types of components exceeds 60 percent of the cost of all its components, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar year 2029, unless an alternate percentage is established for a contract:

      (A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.

      (B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

      (C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Components of unknown origin are treated as foreign; or

      (ii) The end product is a COTS item.  is also defined in the clause at 252.225-7021, Trade Agreements.

      means an offer of a qualifying country end product, including the price of transportation to destination.

      when restricted by words such as foreign, domestic, or qualifying country, means the actual manufacturer or producer of the end product or component.

      means Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, or Uzbekistan.

      means construction material that—

      (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an SC/CASA state; or

      (2) In the case of a construction material that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in an SC/CASA state into a new and different construction material distinct from the material from which it was transformed.

      means an article that—

      (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an SC/CASA state; or

      (2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in an SC/CASA state into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the value of the end product, includes services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply, provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed the value of the product itself.

      means the munitions list of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation in 22 CFR part 121.

#### § 226.7202

        (a)(1) Contracting officers may use this Demonstration Project to award one or more contracts to an eligible contractor for the purpose of providing defense contracting opportunities for entities that employ severely disabled individuals. To determine if there are eligible contractors capable of fulfilling the agency's requirement, conduct market research as described in 210.002 and FAR 10.002. For services, see also PGI 210.070.

        (2) If the contracting officer elects to use this Demonstration Project, FAR 6.302-5 requires a written justification and approval to limit competition to eligible contractors. In the justification, identify the statutory authority for the Demonstration Project (10 U.S.C. 3901 note prec.).

        (b) When using this Demonstration Project, one of the evaluation factors shall be the percentage of the offeror's total workforce that consists of severely disabled individuals employed by the offeror. Contracting officers may use a rating method in which a higher percentage of the offeror's total workforce consisting of severely disabled individuals would result in a higher rating for this evaluation factor.

        (c)(1) Contracts awarded to eligible contractors under this Demonstration Project shall be counted toward DoD's small disadvantaged business goal. The contractor must be an eligible contractor when options under the contract are exercised, in order for DoD to continue to receive credit for the contract toward its small disadvantaged business goal.

        (2) Contracting officers shall verify the contractor's representation ( by checking the System for Award Management) prior to exercising an option on a contract awarded under the Demonstration Project. Contracting officers may exercise the option if the contractor has represented that it is not an eligible contractor; however, the contract shall no longer be counted toward DoD's small disadvantaged business goal.

      Subpart 227.6—Foreign License and Technical Assistance Agreements

        227.670   Scope.

#### § 227.670

        This subpart prescribes policy with respect to foreign license and technical assistance agreements.

        227.671   General.

#### § 227.671

        In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a “primary source,” agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein referred to as a “second source;” foreign patent rights; technical assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source, an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's “price” for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not patent rights are involved.

        227.672   Policy.

#### § 227.672

        It is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts made with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the United States Government, charges for use of patents in which it holds a royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and disclose to others, or which is in the public domain, or which the Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and disclosure to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in negotiating contract prices for foreign license technical assistance contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); and in commenting on such agreements when they are referred to the Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675).

        227.673   Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between the Government and domestic concerns.

#### § 227.673

        (a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide technical assistance or patent rights to a second source for the manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent practicable, specify the rights in patents and data and any other rights to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in connection with any separate agreement between the primary source and the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to the articles or services involved in the contract, that—

        (1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on account of any purchases by the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, any charge to the second source for royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or data which the Government has the right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and the primary source; and

        (2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source shall include a statement referring to the contract between the Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675-1).

        (b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under contracts within (a) of this section:

        (1) The actual cost of providing data, personnel, manufacturing aids, samples, spare parts, and the like;

        (2) The extent to which the Government has contributed to the development of the supplies or services, and to the methods of manufacture or performance, through past contracts for research and development or for manufacture of the supplies or performance of the services; and

        (3) The Government's patent rights and rights in data relating to the supplies or services and to the methods of manufacture or of performance.

        227.674   Supply contracts between the Government and a foreign government or concern.

#### § 227.674

        In negotiating contract prices with a second source, including the redetermination of contract prices, or in determining the allowability of costs under a cost-reimbursement contract with a second source, the contracting officer:

        (a) Shall obtain from the second source a detailed statement (see FAR 27.204-1(a)(2)) of royalties, license fees, and other compensation paid or to be paid to a primary source (or any of his subcontractors) for patent rights, rights in data, and other technical assistance provided to the second source, including identification and description of such patents, data, and technical assistance; and

        (b) Shall not accept or allow charges which in effect are—

        (1) For royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or

        (2) For data which the Government has a right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or

        (3) For any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and a primary source.

        227.675   Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between a domestic concern and a foreign government or concern.

#### § 227.675

        227.675-1   International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

#### § 227.675-1

        Pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), the Department of State controls the exportation of data relating to articles designated in the United States Munitions List as arms, ammunition, or munitions of war. (The Munitions List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR, ) Before authorizing such exportation, the Department of State generally requests comments from the Department of Defense. On request of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), each Department shall submit comments thereon as the basis for a Department of Defense reply to the Department of State.

        227.675-2   Review of agreements.

#### § 227.675-2

        (a) In reviewing foreign license and technical assistance agreements between primary and second sources, the Department concerned shall, insofar as its interests are involved, indicate whether the agreement meets the requirements of §§ 124.07-124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or in what respects it is deficient. Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this subsection provide general guidance.

        (b) When it is reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement, or that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the procurement of the supplies or services, the following guidance applies.

        (1) If the agreement specifies a reduction in charges thereunder, with respect to purchases by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in recognition of the Government's rights in patents and data, the Department concerned shall evaluate the amount of the reduction to determine whether it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, before indicating its approval.

        (2) If the agreement does not specify any reduction in charges or otherwise fails to give recognition to the Government's rights in the patents or data involved, approval shall be conditioned upon amendment of the agreement to reflect a reduction, evaluated by the Department concerned as acceptable to the Government, in any charge thereunder with respect to purchases made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in accordance with § 124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

        (3) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the extent of the Government's rights, the Department concerned shall evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval.

        (4) If time or circumstances do not permit the evaluation called for in (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the guidance in (c) of this subsection shall be followed.

        (c) When it is not reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement nor that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the purchase of the supplies or services, then the following guidance applies.

        (1) If the agreement provides for charges to the second source for data or patent rights, it may suffice to fulfill the requirements of § 124.10 insofar as the Department of Defense is concerned if:

        (i) The agreement requires the second source to advise the primary source when he has knowledge of any purchase made or to be made from him by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government;

        (ii) The primary source separately agrees with the Government that upon such advice to him from the second source or from the Government or otherwise as to any such a purchase or prospective purchase, he will negotiate with the Department concerned an appropriate reduction in his charges to the second source in recognition of any Government rights in patents or data; and

        (iii) The agreement between the primary and second sources further provides that in the event of any such purchase and resulting reduction in charges, the second source shall pass on this reduction to the Government by giving the Government a corresponding reduction in the purchase price of the article or service.

        (2) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the extent to which the Government has rights, the Department concerned shall:

        (i) Evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval; or

        (ii) Explicitly condition its approval on the right to evaluate the acceptability of the provision at a later time.

        (d) When there is a technical assistance agreement between the primary source and the Government related to the agreement between the primary and second sources that is under review, the latter agreement shall reflect the arrangements contemplated with respect thereto by the Government's technical assistance agreement with the primary source.

        (e) Every agreement shall provide that any license rights transferred under the agreement are subject to existing rights of the Government.

        (f) In connection with every agreement referred to in (b) of this section, a request shall be made to the primary source—

        (1) To identify the patents, data, and other technical assistance to be provided to the second source by the primary source or any of his subcontractors,

        (2) To identify any such patents and data in which, to the knowledge of the primary source, the Government may have rights, and

        (3) To segregate the charges made to the second source for each such category or item of patents, data, and other technical assistance.

        (g) The Department concerned shall make it clear that its approval of any agreement does not necessarily recognize the propriety of the charges or the amounts thereof, or constitute approval of any of the business arrangements in the agreement, unless the Department expressly intends by its approval to commit itself to the fairness and reasonableness of a particular charge or charges. In any event, a disclaimer should be made to charges or business terms not affecting any purchase made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government.

        227.7005   Indirect notice of patent infringement claims.

#### § 227.7005

        (a) A communication by a patent owner to a Department of Defense contractor alleging that the contractor has committed acts of infringement in performance of a Government contract shall not be considered a claim within the meaning of 227.7004 until it meets the requirements specified therein.

        Settlement of claims involving payment for past infringement shall not be made without the consent of, and equitable contribution by, each indemnifying contractor involved, unless such settlement is determined to be in the best interests of the Government and is coordinated with the Department of Justice with a view to preserving any rights of the Government against the contractors involved. If consent of and equitable contribution by the contractors are obtained, the settlement need not be coordinated with the Department of Justice.

        227.7009-2   Clauses to be used when applicable.

#### § 227.7009-2

        (a)  The clause at 252.227-7001, Release of Past Infringement, is an example which may be modified or omitted as appropriate for particular circumstances, but only upon the advice of cognizant patent or legal counsel. (See footnotes at end of clause.)

        (b)  The clause at 252.227-7002, Readjustment of Payments, shall be inserted in contracts providing for payment of a running royalty.

        (c)  The clause at 252.227-7003, Termination, is an example for use in contracts providing for the payment of a running royalty.

#### § 227.7009-4

        The clauses set forth below are examples which may be used in patent release and settlement agreements, and license agreements, when it is desired to cover the subject matter thereof and the contract provides for payment of a running royalty.

        (a)  No Department shall be obligated to pay royalties unless the contract is signed on behalf of such Department. Accordingly, the License Grant clause at 252.227-7006 should be limited to the practice of the invention by or for the signatory Department or Departments.

        (b)  The clause at 252.227-7007 is a sample form for expressing the license term.

        (c)  The clause at 252.227-7008 providing for the computation of royalties, may be of varying scope depending upon the nature of the royalty bearing article, the volume of procurement, and the type of contract pursuant to which the procurement is to be accomplished.

        (d)  (1) The contract should contain a provision specifying the office designated within the specific Department involved to make any necessary reports to the contractor of the extent of use of the licensed subject matter by the entire Department, and such office shall be charged with the responsibility of obtaining from all procuring offices of that Department the information necessary to make the required reports and corresponding vouchers necessary to make the required payments. The clause at 252.227-7009 is a sample for expressing reporting and payment of royalties requirements.

        (2) Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period, the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.

        (e)  When it is intended that a license on the same terms and conditions be available to other departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010 is an example which may be used.

        227.7010   Assignments.

#### § 227.7010

        (a) The clause at 252.227-7011 is an example which may be used in contracts of assignment of patent rights to the Government.

        (b) To facilitate proof of contracts of assignments, the acknowledgement of the contractor should be executed before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths (35 U.S.C. 261).

        227.7011   Procurement of rights in inventions, patents, and copyrights.

#### § 227.7011

        Even though no infringement has occurred or been alleged, it is the policy of the Department of Defense to procure rights under patents, patent applications, and copyrights whenever it is in the Government's interest to do so and the desired rights can be obtained at a fair price. The required and suggested clauses at 252.227-7004 and 252.227-7010 shall be required and suggested clauses, respectively, for license agreements and assignments made under this paragraph. The instructions at 227.7009-3 and 227.7010 concerning the applicability and use of those clauses shall be followed insofar as they are pertinent.

        227.7012   Contract format.

#### § 227.7012

        The format at 252.227-7012 appropriately modified where necessary, may be used for contracts of release, license, or assignment.

The clause at 252.227-7013 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense.

        (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services that include the clause at 252.227-7015 or the clause at 252.227-7013.

#### § 227.7103

        227.7103-1   Policy.

#### § 227.7103-1

        (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data, and the rights in that data, necessary to satisfy agency needs.

        (b) Solicitations and contracts shall—

        (1) Specify the technical data to be delivered under a contract and delivery schedules for the data;

        (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data;

        (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent practicable, for the technical data to be delivered under a contract and require offerors and contractors to price separately each deliverable data item; and

        (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, technical data to be furnished with restrictions on the Government's rights and require contractors to identify technical data to be delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.

        (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components or processes developed at private expense except for the data identified at 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9).

        (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes developed at private expense solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose technical data pertaining to those items may be restricted.

        (e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 3208, solicitations for major systems development contracts shall not require offerors to submit proposals that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items identical to items developed at private expense unless a determination is made at a level above the contracting officer that—

        (1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or

        (2) The offeror's proposal to meet mobilization requirements does not satisfy mobilization needs.

        (f) For acquisitions involving major weapon systems or subsystems of major weapon systems, the acquisition plan shall address acquisition strategies that provide for technical data and the associated license rights in accordance with 207.106(S-70).

        (g) The Government's rights in a vessel design, and in any useful article embodying a vessel design, must be consistent with the Government's rights in technical data pertaining to the design (10 U.S.C. 8687; 17 U.S.C. 1301(a)(3)).

> [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 72 FR 51189, Sept. 6, 2007; 74 FR 61044, Nov. 23, 2009; 87 FR 15818, Mar. 18, 2022; 87 FR 76994, Dec. 16, 2022]

        227.7103-2   Acquisition of technical data.

#### § 227.7103-2

        (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103-1.

        (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's life-cycle needs for technical data. Technical data needs must be established giving consideration to the offeror's economic interests in technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense (including the economic interests of small businesses and nontraditional contractors); the Government's costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the technical data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance, and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components, or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be identified as deliverable technical data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, form, fit, and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources that can reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.

        (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer.

        (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—

        (1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data will be delivered;

        (2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an exhibit to the contract);

        (3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item under a fixed-price type contract;

        (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and

        (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data.

        227.7103-3   Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction, or disclosure.

#### § 227.7103-3

        (a) 10 U.S.C. 3772(a) requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use.

        (b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertions to the offer.

        (c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use of that clause and its alternate is at 227.7103-6 (a) and (b).

        227.7103-4   License rights.

#### § 227.7103-4

        (a)  The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under and irrevocable license granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to create the data.

        (1)  Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for government purposes (government purpose rights).

        (2)  Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created exclusively at private expense.

        (b)  The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or subcomponent level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items.

        227.7103-5   Government rights.

#### § 227.7103-5

        The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services. In unusual situations, the standards rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

        (a)  The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are—

        (1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;

        (2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;

        (3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;

        (4) Form, fit, and function data;

        (5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);

        (6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;

        (7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;

        (8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or

        (9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—

        (i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or

        (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.

        (b)  (1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data—

        (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or

        (ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.

        (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.

        (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development. Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.

        (4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless—

        (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or

        (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

        (5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and nondisclosure agreement.

        (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and nondisclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the System for Award Management or other publications must provide notice of the use and nondisclosure requirements. Class use and nondisclosure agreements ( agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.

        (c)  (1) The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—

        (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or

        (ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.

        (2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—

        (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or

        (ii) To a covered Government support contractor; or

        (iii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.

        (3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.

        (4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the intended recipient must complete the use and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103-7, or receive the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.

        (d)  (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the government or when the government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.

        (2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—

        (i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;

        (ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or

        (iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.

        227.7103-6   Contract clauses.

#### § 227.7103-6

        (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver to the Government technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services, or pertaining to commercial products or commercial services for which the Government will have paid for any portion of the development costs (in which case the clause at 252.227-7013 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed exclusively at private expense). Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer software or computer software documentation (see 227.72), commercial products or commercial services developed exclusively at private expense (see 227.7102-4), existing works (see 227.7105), or special works (see 227.7106). When contracting under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program, see 227.7104-4(a).

        (b)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate I in research solicitations and contracts, including research solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—

        (i) In the interest of the government; and

        (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.

        (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate II in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, that are for the development or delivery of a vessel design or any useful article embodying a vessel design.

        (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014), for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).

        (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data specified in the solicitations as deliverable data items that are the same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.

        (e) Use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7013:

        (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;

        (2) 252.227-7030, Technical Data—Withholding of Payment; and

        (3) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included in a challenge).

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure may not be provided to third parties, unless the intended recipient completes and signs the use and nondisclosure agreement at paragraph (c) of this section prior to release or disclosure of the data.

        (1) The specific conditions under which an intended recipient will be authorized to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data subject to limited rights or SBIR/STTR data rights, or computer software subject to restricted rights or SBIR/STTR data rights must be stipulated in an attachment to the use and nondisclosure agreement.

        (2) For an intended release, disclosure, or authorized use of technical data or computer software subject to special license rights, modify paragraph (1)(d) of the use and nondisclosure agreement in paragraph (c) of this section to enter the conditions, consistent with the license requirements, governing the recipient's obligations regarding use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the data or software.

        (b) The requirement for use and nondisclosure agreements does not apply to Government contractors which require access to a third party's data or software for the performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

        227.7103-8   Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of technical data.

#### § 227.7103-8

        (a)  Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of technical data identified as “deferred delivery” data at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery.

        (b)  Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

        227.7103-9   Copyright.

#### § 227.7103-9

        (a)  (1) The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, require a contractor to grant or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clauses. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.

        (2) The clauses at 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7018 do not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third-party copyrighted data in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third-party material or when the use of the third-party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.

        (b)  See 227.7105 or 227.7106 for copyright considerations when acquiring existing or special works that are not SBIR/STTR data.

        227.7103-10   Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.

#### § 227.7103-10

        (a)  (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.

        (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13.

        (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, permit the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.

        (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7103-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.

        (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, contracting officers shall not—

        (i) Prohibit offerors from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to provide the technical data with restrictions; or

        (ii) Require offerors, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish rights in technical data except for the standard rights specified in the applicable clauses.

        (b)  The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program—

        (1) Require a contractor that desires to restrict the Government's rights in technical data to place restrictive markings on the data, provide instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorize the use of certain restrictive markings; and

        (2) Require a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's preexisting rights in that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.

        (c)  (1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.

        (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:

        (i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;

        (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the clauses at 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7018; and

        (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.

        (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.

        227.7103-11   Contractor procedures and records.

#### § 227.7103-11

        (a) The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, require a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.

        (b) The clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, requires contractors and their subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.

> [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 88 FR 6585, Jan. 31, 2023; 89 FR 103344, Dec. 18, 2024]

        227.7103-12   Government right to establish conformity of markings.

#### § 227.7103-12

        (a)  (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clauses at 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7018 is also a nonconforming marking.

        (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.

        (b)  (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.

        (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—

        (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or

        (ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.

> [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 88 FR 6585, Jan. 31, 2023; 89 FR 103344, Dec. 18, 2024]

        227.7103-13   Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.

#### § 227.7103-13

        (a)  An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 3782, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.

        (b)  The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 3782 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.

        (c) —(1)  Contracting officers shall have reasonable grounds to challenge the validity of an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the assertion.

        (2)  10 U.S.C. 3772(a)(1) and 3784 establish a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for technical data related to commercial products or commercial services on the basis of development exclusively at private expense. Contracting officers shall presume that a commercial product or commercial service was developed exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. The contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial product or commercial service was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can specifically state the reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion. The challenge notice shall include sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense. In order to sustain the challenge, the contracting officer shall provide information demonstrating that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense. The challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information. A contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.

        (d)  All challenges shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.

        (1)  Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data—

        (i) Are publicly available without restrictions;

        (ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or

        (iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party.

        (2)  (i) After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.

        (ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.

        (3)  The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—

        (i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;

        (ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or suppliers right to assert restrictions; or

        (iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.

        (4)  The contracting officer shall not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. For commercial products or commercial services, also see paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The contracting officer may challenge an assertion whether or not supporting documentation was requested under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Challenge notices shall be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice shall include the information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037.

        (5)  The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.

        (6)  Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has been justified.

        (i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued a soon as practicable following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.

        (ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction to the contract attachment.

        (iii) A contracting officer who determine that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-7037. As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.

        (7)  When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

        (8)  Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the asserted restriction.

        227.7103-14   Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data.

#### § 227.7103-14

        (a)  10 U.S.C. 3772—

        (1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and

        (2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.

        (b)  (1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.

        (2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data—Withholding of Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of the data. For example—

        (i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or

        (ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.

        (3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), correction or replacement of nonconforming data or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—

        (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or

        (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.

        (4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings.

        (c)  (1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process. For example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends to repair or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data would impair the Government's effective use of the item or result in increased costs to the Government.

        (2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.

        227.7103-15   Subcontractor rights in technical data.

#### § 227.7103-15

        (a) 10 U.S.C. 3771 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime contractors. The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, implement the statutory requirements.

        (b) 10 U.S.C. 3782 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation of its asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains a contractor's agreement that the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercise its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-13(c)(3).

        (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will be furnishing technical data for other than commercial products or commercial services in response to a Government requirement:

        (1) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services;

        (2) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;

        (3) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government; and

        (4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.

        (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services clause contained in the contractor's contract with the Government.

        227.7103-16   Providing technical data to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

#### § 227.7103-16

        Technical data may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—

        (a) May release or disclose technical data in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and

        (b) Shall not release or disclose technical data for which restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to foreign entities, or authorize the use of technical data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same provisions as included in the use and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7103, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, governing use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data have been satisfied.

        227.7103-17   Overseas contracts with foreign sources.

#### § 227.7103-17

        (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose all technical data to be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special works.

        (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights in the technical data that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

        (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate data rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

        227.7104-1   Policy.

#### § 227.7104-1

        (a) Do not require an offeror, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components, or processes developed under a SBIR/STTR contract or any rights in computer software generated under a SBIR/STTR contract except for the standard rights identified at 227.7104-2.

        (b) Do not prohibit contractors and offerors from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes developed under a SBIR/STTR contract or computer software generated under a SBIR/STTR contract solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose such computer software or technical data pertaining to those items, components, or processes may be restricted.

        (c) Consistent with the guidance in this section, 227.7103-10(a)(5), 227.7203-10(a)(5), and other acquisition guidance applicable to SBIR/STTR solicitations, the Government may use information provided by offerors in response to a solicitation in the source selection process to evaluate the impact of proposed restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data or computer software.

        (d) SBIR/STTR data rights apply to SBIR/STTR data that are delivered, developed, or generated in the performance of a contract or agreement that is covered by SBIR/STTR policies, including contracts and subcontracts that include phase III work. Phase III work refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR/STTR contracts or agreements, and is funded by sources other than SBIR/STTR programs (see PGI 227.7104-1).

        (e) For SBIR/STTR data that is other than commercial technical data, and other than commercial computer software and computer software documentation, see—

        (1) 227.7103-9 and 227.7203-9 for guidance on copyright licenses;

        (2) 227.7103-10 and 227.7203-10 for guidance on contractor identification and marking of technical data and computer software to be furnished with restrictive markings;

        (3) 227.7103-11 and 227.7203-11 for guidance on maintenance of contractor records; and

        (4) 227.7103-12 and 227.7203-12 for guidance on nonconforming and unjustified markings.

        227.7104-2   Rights in SBIR or STTR data.

#### § 227.7104-2

        (a) Under the clause at 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software-Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, the Government obtains the following standard license rights:

        (1) Unlimited rights in the technical data and computer software listed in paragraph (c)(1) of the clause.

        (2) SBIR/STTR data rights in all other technical data and computer software developed or generated under the phase I, II, or III SBIR/STTR contract or subcontract and marked with the SBIR/STTR data rights marking. SBIR/STTR data rights provide the Government limited rights in such technical data and restricted rights in such computer software during the SBIR/STTR data protection period commencing on the date of contract award and ending 20 years after that date unless, after award, the agency and the contractor negotiate for some other protection period for the SBIR/STTR data. Upon expiration of the SBIR/STTR data protection period, the Government has government purpose rights in the SBIR/STTR data. These government purpose rights do not expire. See 252.227-7018 for the definition of the SBIR/STTR data protection period and PGI 227.7104-2 for additional guidance on the SBIR/STTR data protection period.

        (b) During the SBIR/STTR data protection period, the Government may not release or disclose technical data or computer software that is subject to SBIR/STTR data rights to any person except as authorized for limited rights technical data or restricted rights computer software, respectively.

        (c) The Government and contractor or subcontractor may negotiate special license rights only after contract award. The Government shall not make contract award conditional on the contractor or subcontractor negotiating or consenting to negotiate special license rights. Negotiation of special license rights is authorized only after contract award by mutual agreement of the parties.

        (d) The Small Business Administration's SBIR and STTR Program Policy Directive (effective May 3, 2023) provides for special consideration regarding the handling ( disclosure, reverse engineering) of prototypes generated under SBIR and STTR awards, to avoid effects that may appear to be inconsistent with the SBIR and STTR program objectives and to allow the SBIR/STTR awardee to retain rights in SBIR/STTR data during the SBIR/STTR data protection period.

        (e) The clause at 252.227-7018 governs the Government's license rights in SBIR/STTR data. However, the following clauses or guidance governs the Government's license rights in any data that are not SBIR/STTR data:

        (1) For technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, governs such technical data in accordance with 227.7102-4(b).

        (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—

        (1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple users at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software or documentation will be delivered;

        (2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);

        (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation under a fixed-price type contract;

        (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item;

        (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item; and

        (6) Specify in the negotiated terms that any required other than commercial computer software, related recorded information, and associated license rights identified in the assessment of life-cycle needs in paragraph (b) of this section shall to the extent appropriate—

        (i) Include computer software delivered in a digital format compatible with applicable computer programs on relevant system hardware;

        (ii) Not rely on additional internal or external other than commercial or commercial technical data and software, unless such technical data or software is—

        (A) Included in the items to be delivered with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs; or

        (B) Commercially available with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs; and

        (iii) Include sufficient information, with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs, to support maintenance and understanding of interfaces and software version history when the negotiated terms do not allow for the inclusion of the external or additional other than commercial or commercial technical data and software.

        227.7203-3   Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction, or disclosure.

#### § 227.7203-3

        (a) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitation that include the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertion to the offer.

        (b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its alternates are at 227.7203-6(a).

        227.7203-4   License rights.

#### § 227.7203-4

        (a)  The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203-5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.

        (b)  The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation.

        227.7203-5   Government rights.

#### § 227.7203-5

        The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

        (a)  The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—

        (1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;

        (2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;

        (3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;

        (4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or it assets to another party;

        (5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or

        (6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with—

        (i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive conditions have expired; or

        (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has expired.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software developed with mixed funding.

        (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the software.

        (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software. Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the right to authorize others to use data for commercial purposes.

        (4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to any person unless—

        (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or

        (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

        (5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and nondisclosure agreement.

        (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and nondisclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the System for Award Management or other publications must provide notice of the use and nondisclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements ( agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.

        (c)  (1) The Government obtains restricted rights in other than commercial computer software, required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Government under a contract, that was developed exclusively at private expense.

        (2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.

        (d)  Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.

        (e)  The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.

        227.7203-6   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 227.7203-6

        (a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation, commercial products, commercial services (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104). Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.

        (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—

        (i) In the interest of the Government; and

        (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.

        (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014.

        (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software.

        (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014), for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).

        (e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.

        (f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver other than commercial computer software documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786. Paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge.

        227.7203-8   Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.

#### § 227.7203-8

        (a)  Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as “deferred delivery” data or computer software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.

        (b)  Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for computer software or computer software documentation. Under this clause the contracting officer may order any computer software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

        227.7203-9   Copyright.

#### § 227.7203-9

        (a)  (1) The clauses at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, require a contractor to grant, or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or documentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in technical data license.

        (2) The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, do not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third-party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third-party material or when the use of the third-party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.

        (b)  See 227.7205 for copyright considerations when acquiring special works that are not SBIR/STTR data.

        227.7203-10   Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings.

#### § 227.7203-10

        (a)  (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. Subsequent to contract award, the clauses at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, permit a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306(a). An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.

        (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13.

        (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.

        (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7203-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.

        (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer software or computer software documentation. However, contracting officers shall not—

        (i) Prohibit offerors from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to provide the computer software with restrictions; or

        (ii) Require offerors, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish rights in computer software except for the standard rights specified in the applicable clauses.

        (b)  The clauses at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program—

        (1) Require a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provide instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorize the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license notice; and

        (2) Require a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any computer software or computer software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's preexisting rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, produce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.

        (c)  (1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of the request.

        (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must—

        (i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked;

        (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the clauses at 252.227-7014 and 252.227-7018; and

        (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.

        (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the software or documentation were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.

        227.7203-11   Contractor procedures and records.

#### § 227.7203-11

        (a) The clauses at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, require a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of restrictive markings.

        (b) The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, requires contractors and their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions on the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of computer software.

> [60 FR 33482, June 28, 1995, as amended at 88 FR 6587, Jan. 31, 2023; 89 FR 103347, Dec. 18, 2024]

        227.7203-12   Government right to establish conformity of markings.

#### § 227.7203-12

        (a)  (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clauses at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clauses at 252.227-7014 and 252.227-7018 is also a nonconforming marking.

        (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.

        (b)  (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.

        (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—

        (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or

        (ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.

> [60 FR 33482, June 28, 1995, as amended at 88 FR 6587, Jan. 31, 2023; 89 FR 103347, Dec. 18, 2024]

        227.7203-13   Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.

#### § 227.7203-13

        (a)  An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.

        (b)  Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5(d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.

        (c)  The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—

        (1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor.

        (2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or

        (3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.

        (d) —(1)  The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.

        (2)  Computer software documentation is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13. The procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements contained in 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7103-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.

        (3)  (i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions.

        (ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.

        (iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to the person asserting the restriction.

        (4)  The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.

        (e)  (1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227-7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.

        (2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.

        (f)  When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

        227.7203-14   Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of computer software and computer software documentation.

#### § 227.7203-14

        (a)  Computer software documentation is technical data. See 227.7103-14 for appropriate guidance and statutory requirements.

        (b) —(1)  Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify the requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms to the contractual requirements. Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (follow the procedures at 227.7203-12(a) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements), do not accept software that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements. Correction or replacement of nonconforming software, or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—

        (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or

        (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.

        (2) —(i)  Computer software that is a component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be warranted as part of the weapon system warranty. Follow the procedures at 246.7.

        (ii)  Approval of the chief of the contracting office must be obtained to use a computer software warranty other than a weapon system warranty. Consider the factors at FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to obtain a computer software warranty. When approval for a warranty has been obtained, the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, and its alternates, may be appropriately modified for use with computer software or a procurement specific clause may be developed.

        227.7203-15   Subcontractor rights in computer software or computer software documentation.

#### § 227.7203-15

        (a) Subcontractors and suppliers at all tiers should be provided the same protection for their rights in computer software or computer software documentation as are provided to prime contractors.

        (b) The clauses at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, obtain a contractor's agreement that the Government's transaction of validation or challenge matters directly with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7203-13(c) for computer software and 227.7103-13(c)(3) for computer software documentation (technical data).

        (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers who will be furnishing computer software in response to a Government requirement (see 227.7103-15(c) for clauses required when subcontractors or suppliers will be furnishing computer software documentation (technical data)):

        (1) 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation;

        (2) 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software;

        (3) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends; and

        (4) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government.

        (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the provisions of the Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in the contractor's contract with the Government.

        227.7203-16   Providing computer software or computer software documentation to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

#### § 227.7203-16

        Computer software or computer software documentation may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—

        (a) May release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and

        (b) Shall not release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, governing use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data have been satisfied.

#### § 227.7203-17

        (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection) in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose all computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for special works.

        (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights to the computer software or computer software documentation that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the software rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

        (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate software rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

        227.7205   Contracts for special works.

#### § 227.7205

        (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to control the distribution of computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such software or documentation. Use the clause—

        (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, when the Government must own or control copyright in all computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract; or

        (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7014 when the Government must own or control copyright in some of the computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.

        (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or computer software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that software or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.

        (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.

        (d) Examples of other works which may be procured under the clause at 252.227-7020 include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works, scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers and employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the individuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.

        (2) Items removed from a Government-furnished aircraft that are—

        (i) Intended for reinstallation on that particular aircraft, which retain their status as covered aircraft while awaiting installation; and

        (ii) Not intended for reinstallation on that particular aircraft, which lose their status as covered aircraft once removal is complete;

        (3) New production aircraft when wholly outside of buildings on the contractor's premises or other places described in the contract Schedule ( hush houses, run stations, and paint facilities); and

        (4) Commercial aircraft, to include commercially available off-the-shelf aircraft, become covered aircraft when the commercial aircraft arrives at the contractor's place of performance for modification under the terms of the contract.

        means, unless otherwise provided in the contract Schedule, personnel required in the flight manual, assigned for the purpose of conducting any flight on behalf of the contractor. It also includes any operator of an unmanned aerial vehicle.

        means any flight approved in writing by the Government flight representative, to include taxi test made in the performance of the contract, or flight for the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft. All aircraft off the contractor's premises shall be considered to be in flight when on the ground or water for reasonable periods of time following emergency landings, landings made in performance of the contract, or landings approved in writing by the contracting officer.

        means an aircraft that meets the definition in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(41) and the qualifications in 49 U.S.C. 40125. Specifically, a public aircraft means any of the following:

        (1) An aircraft used only for the Government, except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (7) of this definition.

        (2) An aircraft owned by the Government and operated by any person for purposes related to crew training, equipment development, or demonstration, except as provided in paragraph (7) of this definition.

        (3) An aircraft owned and operated by the government of a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States or a political subdivision of one of these governments, except as provided in paragraph (7) of this definition.

        (4) An aircraft exclusively leased for at least 90 continuous days by the government of a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States or a political subdivision of one of these governments, except as provided in paragraph (7) of this definition.

        (5) An aircraft owned or operated by the armed forces or chartered to provide transportation or other commercial air service to the armed forces under the conditions specified by 49 U.S.C. 40125(c). In the preceding sentence, the term “other commercial air service” means an aircraft operation that—

        (i) Is within the United States territorial airspace;

        (ii) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration determines is available for compensation or hire to the public; and

        (iii) Must comply with all applicable civil aircraft rules under title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122), except as provided in paragraph (7) of this definition.

        (7) As described in 49 U.S.C. 40125(b), an aircraft described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this definition does not qualify as a public aircraft in situations where the aircraft is used for commercial purposes or to carry an individual other than a crewmember or a qualified non-crewmember.

        means operation of an aircraft that meets the legal definition of public aircraft established in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(41) and the legal qualifications for public aircraft status outlined in 49 U.S.C. 40125.

        means an aircraft operated by the Government for sovereign, noncommercial purposes such as military, customs, and police services. Military aircraft are afforded status as state aircraft. In very rare circumstances, DoD-contracted aircraft may be designated, in writing, by a responsible Government official pursuant to DoD Directive 4500.54E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program, to be operated in state aircraft status, and States may choose to treat them as deemed state aircraft when they are operating under a Government contract.

        means damage to the aircraft that is the result of an incorrectly performed skill-based task, operation, or action that was originally planned or intended.

        228.370-2   General.

#### § 228.370-2

        (a)  See PGI 228.370-2(a) for procedures on assigning a Government flight representative (GFR) when using the clauses at 252.228-7001 and 252.228-7007.

        (b)  Before awarding any contract using the clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, the contracting officer should obtain a preaward survey of the offeror's proposed aircraft flight and ground operations facility. If the offeror proposed subcontracting any aircraft work, the preaward survey should include a review of the subcontractor's facility. For acquisitions falling under the exceptions at 228.371(b)(1)(iii), (iv), and (vi), the contracting officer shall review the documentation the offeror submitted with the proposal in response to the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, to ensure the offeror's commercial insurance provides the appropriate coverage required by the clause at 252.228-7001.

        (c)  The exception for foreign military sales (FMS) contracts at 228.371(b)(1)(iii) only applies to FMS cases where the FMS customer has explicitly refused assumption of risk of loss. If the FMS customer has accepted the standard Letter of Offer and Acceptance Standard Terms and Conditions, as described in DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual, they have assumed risk of loss.

        (d)  The exception at 228.371(b)(1)(iv) for commercial derivative aircraft only applies if the contractor is a licensed and certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) repair station for the specific model of aircraft under contract, when work is being performed pursuant to the FAA license under 14 CFR part 145. The FAA's repair station search tool is available at  All aircraft flying public aircraft operations operate under airworthiness certificates maintained by the military services. The FAA airworthiness certificate in the exception in this paragraph (d) underlies the military service certificate.

        (e)  The clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, is intended to reduce acquisition costs by eliminating the costs of commercial insurance premiums. This clause also is intended to encourage the contractor to perform safe and effective operations through inclusion of a contractor's share of loss ( a deductible). Additionally, the clause requires compliance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations” (Air Force Instruction 10-220, Army Regulation 95-20, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Instruction 3710.1 (Series), Coast Guard Instruction M13020.3 (Series), and Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210-1 (Series)), which provides procedures to mitigate the risk of loss to the Government. For this reason, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the clause at 252.228-7001 specifies that insurance premium costs are unallowable. In addition, paragraph (d)(4) of the clause provides that the Government's assumption of risk does not apply where the loss or damage is covered by available insurance.

        (f)  (1) Whenever damage to Government aircraft is reported, each incident should be evaluated on its own merits. When the cost of repair exceeds the contractor's share of loss provisions, the contracting officer shall make a liability determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

        (2) Contracting officers should consult with the requiring activity and the assigned contract administration office on replacement, repair, or beyond economic repair decisions.

        (3) See PGI 228.370-2(f) for an example of accident or mishap damage versus workmanship-error damage.

        (g)  (1) When making a liability determination, the contracting officer should seek input from the GFR and legal counsel, as needed.

        (2) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft that—

        (i) Is the result of willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the contractor's managerial personnel, including the contractor's oversight of subcontractors;

        (ii) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the crewmembers have not been approved in advance and in writing by the GFR, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations”;

        (iii) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways, unless the transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor's premises, and incidental to work performed under the contract as described in the Schedule;

        (iv) Is covered by insurance;

        (v) Occurs after the contracting officer has, in writing, revoked the Government's assumption of risk; or

        (vi) Is sustained due to workmanship errors.

        (h)  The liability provisions of the clause at FAR 52.245-1, Government Property, do not apply to the aircraft impacted by a notice of revocation.

        (1)  (i) When finding that contractor managerial personnel have failed to comply with the combined regulation/instruction, as required by paragraph (b) of the clause at 252.228-7001, including finding the covered aircraft are exposed to unreasonable conditions, the contracting officer shall issue a preliminary notice of revocation of the Government's assumption of risk to the contractor and shall require the contractor to comply with contract requirements. Factors for the contracting officer to consider in determining exposure to unreasonable conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:

        (A) Lack of adequate hangar fire suppression or firefighting vehicles;

        (B) Failure to provide adequate procedures to the GFR; or

        (C) Systemic failure to comply with approved procedures.

        (ii) The preliminary notice of revocation will state the timeframe for the contractor to correct the noncompliance or conditions.

        (2)  If the contractor fails to correct the cited noncompliance or conditions within the specified timeframe, the contracting officer shall issue to the contractor a notice of revocation of the Government's assumption of risk for any covered aircraft.

        (i) Thereafter the contractor assumes the entire risk for damage, loss, or destruction of the previously covered aircraft.

        (ii) Any costs incurred by the contractor, including the costs of the contractor's self-insurance, insurance premiums paid to insure the contractor's assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc., to mitigate its risk are unallowable costs.

        (iii) The notice of revocation does not relieve the contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of the clause at 252.228-7001, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations.”

        (iv) Within 3 days of receipt of the contractor's notice of correction, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor whether the Government will resume risk of loss. The contracting officer shall determine that the noncompliance or cited conditions have been corrected prior to resuming assumption of risk.

        (v) Any disputes regarding the contracting officer's notice of revocation shall be subject to FAR clause 52.233-1, Disputes.

        (i)  (1) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft, except in cases covered by paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall evaluate the contractor's statement of—

        (i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;

        (ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;

        (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are a part; and

        (iv) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled property.

        (2) If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed before it has become a covered aircraft, the Government bears no responsibility for risk of loss.

        (3) If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed after it has become a covered aircraft, the contracting officer shall provide written direction to the contractor to take action in accordance with the contracting officer's written direction that the aircraft shall be—

        (i) Replaced;

        (ii) Repaired to the condition immediately prior to the damage; or

        (iii) Considered beyond economic repair. The contracting officer shall decide whether further actions are required under the contract.

        (4) If a covered aircraft that has been furnished by the Government to the contractor is damaged, lost, or destroyed while covered, the contracting officer shall provide written direction to the contractor that the aircraft shall be—

        (i) Repaired; or

        (ii) Considered beyond economic repair. The contracting officer shall decide further actions required under the contract.

        (5) The contracting officer shall make an equitable adjustment for expenditures made in performing the obligations under paragraph (h) of the clause at 252.228-7001.

        (j)  (1) The contractor's share of loss or damage to covered aircraft, except for loss or damage caused by negligence of Government personnel, is the least of—

        (i) $200,000;

        (ii) 20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; or

        (iii) 20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or delivery order.

        (2) If the Government requires covered aircraft to be replaced or repaired by the contractor, any resulting equitable adjustment shall not include reimbursement of the contractor's share of loss.

        (3) In the event the Government does not decide to replace or repair the covered aircraft, the clause at 252.228-7001 requires the contractor to credit the contract price or pay the Government, as directed by the contracting officer, the least of—

        (i) $200,000;

        (ii) 20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; or

        (iii) 20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or delivery order.

        (4) The costs incurred by the contractor for its share of the loss and for insuring against that loss are unallowable costs, including but not limited to—

        (i) The contractor's share of loss under the Government's self-insurance;

        (ii) The costs of the contractor's self-insurance;

        (iii) The deductible for any contractor-purchased insurance;

        (iv) Insurance premiums paid for contractor-purchased insurance; and

        (v) Costs associated with determining, litigating, and defending against the contractor's liability.

        (k)  If the contracting officer finds or has reason to believe that the contractor has been reimbursed or otherwise compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, then the contracting officer shall demand an equitable reimbursement. If the contracting officer requests that the contractor provide reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery, such effort shall be an allowable expense of the contractor.

        228.370-3   Aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government.

#### § 228.370-3

        (a) When a contract involves aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government, the contracting officer may use the clause at 252.228-7001 only if the contracting officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government.

        (b) Potential factors for the contracting officer to consider when deciding which course of action is in the best interest of the Government include, but are not limited to, whether—

        (1) The cost of hull insurance exceeds the replacement cost of the aircraft;

        (2) Insurance is not available ( high-risk experimental flights and operations of aircraft in a war zone); or

        (3) Ground or flight activities that involve contractor-owned and contractor-operated aircraft may pose risk to Government aircraft ( due to close proximity in flight).

        228.371   Additional clauses.

#### § 228.371

        (2) The head of the contracting activity decides not to allow the contractor to buy insurance for war-hazard losses.

        (b) Use the clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, in solicitations and contracts—

        (1) For the acquisition, development, production, modification, maintenance, repair, flight, or overhaul of aircraft owned by or to be delivered to the Government, except those solicitations and contracts—

        (i) That are strictly for activities incidental to the normal operations of the aircraft ( refueling operations, minor non-structural actions not requiring towing such as replacing aircraft tires due to wear and tear);

        (ii) That are awarded for purchase under FAR part 12 procedures;

        (iii) For which a non-DoD customer (including an FMS customer per 225.7305) has decided to allow the use of commercial insurance or other self-insurance;

        (iv) For commercial derivative aircraft with an FAA certificate of airworthiness maintained to FAA standards. Performance under the exception in this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) must be at a licensed and certified FAA repair station rated for the type of aircraft and work to be maintained. This exception does not apply to contracts requiring flights with contractor crewmembers;

        (v) Under which the aircraft are to be dismantled and removed from the inventory; or

        (vi) Under which the aircraft are classified as Group 1 or 2 unmanned aircraft systems per DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, and the purchase price of the air vehicle, including installed Government-furnished equipment, is below the cost threshold for a Class C mishap per DoDI 6055.07; or

        (2) Involving aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government, only if the contracting officer decides that it is in the best interest of the Government. See 228.370-3.

        (c) The clause at 252.228-7003, Capture and Detention, may be used when contractor employees are subject to capture and detention and may not be covered by the War Hazards Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 1701 ).

        231.205-18   Independent research and development and bid and proposal costs.

#### § 231.205-18

        (a)  As used in this section—

        means a DoD prime contract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price contract without cost incentives. The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.

        means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development (IR&D) costs and bid and proposal (B&P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&D costs and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.

        means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11 million in IR&D costs and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&D and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.

        (c)  (i) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any way that limits IR&D cost allowability and B&P cost allowability.

        (ii) See 225.7303-2(c) for allowability provisions affecting foreign military sale contracts.

        (iii)(A) For IR&D costs major contractors incurred on covered contracts to be allowable—

        () The contractor is required to report IR&D projects generating the IR&D costs to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using the DTIC's online input form and instructions at  and

        () The contractor is required to update its DTIC inputs at least annually, no later than 3 months after the end of the contractor's fiscal year, and when the project is completed.

        (B) The amount of IR&D costs allowable under DoD contracts shall not exceed the lesser of—

        () Such contracts' allocable share of total incurred IR&D costs; or

        () The total amount of incurred IR&D costs that the chief executive officer of the contractor has determined will advance the needs of DoD for future technology and advanced capability as DoD describes such needs in communications referenced at _2_42.771-3(c)(1)(i).

        (C) Contractors that are not major contractors are encouraged to use the DTIC online input form and instructions at  to report IR&D projects in order to provide DoD with visibility into the technical content of the contractors' IR&D projects.

        (iv) Contractors are required to report incurred IR&D costs separately from indirect costs.

        (v) Contractors are required to report incurred B&P costs separately from other indirect costs.

        231.205-70   External restructuring costs.

#### § 231.205-70

        (a)  This subsection—

        (1) Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD; and

        (2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 3761.

        (b)  As used in this section:

        (1)  means a transaction whereby assets or operations of two or more companies not previously under common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.

        (2)  means restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company. _External restructuring activities_ are a direct outgrowth of a business combination. They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the business combination.

        (3)  means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall costs. _Restructuring activities_ do not include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor's productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).

        (4)  means the costs, including both direct and indirect, of restructuring activities. _Restructuring costs_ that may be allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of plant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall not be subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for determining cost allowability in accordance with FAR part 31 shall apply.

        (5)  means cost reductions, including both direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not restructuring savings.

        (c)  Restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed unless—

        (1) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR part 31 and DFARS part 231;

        (2) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is performed;

        (3) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, and negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection; and

        (4)(i) The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection determines in writing that the audited projected savings, on a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either—

        (A) The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or

        (B) The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD.

        (ii)(A) If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million over a 5-year period, the designated official is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) or the Principal Deputy. This authority may not be delegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary of Defense.

        (B) For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Director may not delegate this authority.

        (d)  As soon as it is known that the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205-70(d).

        (e)  (1) The novation agreement (if one is required).

        (2) The contractor's restructuring proposal.

        (3) The proposed advance agreement.

        (4) The audit report.

        (5) Any other pertinent information.

        (6) The cognizant ACO's recommendation for a determination. This recommendation must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:

        (i) The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.

        (ii) The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.

        (f)  (1) The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts that are negotiated during the period between—

        (i) The time a business combination is announced; and

        (ii) The time the contractor's forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.

        (2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including—

        (i) When the restructuring will take place;

        (ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;

        (iii) The contract performance period;

        (iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and

        (v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.

        (3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.

L. 114-92).

        (b) The costs of counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts and the costs of rework or corrective action that may be required to remedy the use or inclusion of such parts are unallowable, unless—

        (1) The contractor has an operational system to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts that has been reviewed and approved by DoD pursuant to 244.303(b);

        (2) The counterfeit electronic parts or suspect counterfeit electronic parts are Government-furnished property as defined in FAR 45.101 or were obtained by the contractor in accordance with the clause at 252.246-7008, Sources of Electronic Parts; and

        (3) The contractor—

        (i) Becomes aware of the counterfeit electronic parts or suspect counterfeit electronic parts through inspection, testing, and authentication efforts of the contractor or its subcontractors; through a Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) alert; or by other means; and

        (ii) Provides timely ( within 60 days after the contractor becomes aware) written notice to—

        (A) The cognizant contracting officer(s); and

        (B) GIDEP (unless the contractor is a foreign corporation or partnership that does not have an office, place of business, or fiscal paying agent in the United States; or the counterfeit electronic part or suspect counterfeit electronic part is the subject of an on-going criminal investigation).

#### § 231.303

        (1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not applied to other organizations performing similar work.

        (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.

        (3) Under 10 U.S.C. 4652, the costs cited in 231.205-22(a) are unallowable.

        232.102   Description of contract financing methods.

#### § 232.102

        (e)(2) Progress payments based on percentage or stage of completion are authorized only for contracts for construction (as defined in FAR 36.102), shipbuilding, and ship conversion, alteration, or repair. However, percentage or state of completion methods of measuring contractor performance may be used for performance-based payments in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.10.

        232.102-70   Provisional delivery payments.

#### § 232.102-70

        (a) The contracting officer may establish provisional delivery payments to pay contractors for the costs of supplies and services delivered to and accepted by the Government under the following contract actions if undefinitized:

        (1) Letter contracts contemplating a fixed-price contract.

        (2) Orders under basic ordering agreements.

        (3) Spares provisioning documents annexed to contracts.

        (4) Unpriced equitable adjustments on fixed-price contracts.

        (5) Orders under indefinite-delivery contracts.

        (b) Provisional delivery payments shall be—

        (1) Used sparingly;

        (2) Priced conservatively; and

        (3) Reduced by liquidating previous progress payments in accordance with the Progress Payments clause.

        (c) Provisional delivery payments shall not—

        (1) Include profit;

        (2) Exceed funds obligated for the undefinitized contract action; or

        (3) Influence the definitized contract price.

        232.104   Providing contract financing.

#### § 232.104

        For fixed-price contracts with a period of performance in excess of a year that meet the dollar thresholds established in FAR 32.104(d), and for solicitations expected to result in such contracts, in lieu of the requirement at FAR 32.104(d)(1)(ii) for the contractor to demonstrate actual financial need or the unavailability of private financing, DoD has determined that—

        (1) The use of customary contract financing (see FAR 32.113), other than loan guarantees and advance payments, is in DoD's best interest; and

        (2) Further justification of its use in individual acquisitions is unnecessary.

        (a)(2) When determining whether an offeror's financial condition is adequate security, see 232.072-2 and 232.072-3 for guidance. It should be noted that an offeror's financial condition may be sufficient to make the contractor responsible for award purposes, but may not be adequate security for commercial contract financing.

        232.206   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 232.206

        (f)  The contracting officer shall incorporate the following standard prompt payment terms for commercial product and commercial service contract financing:

        (i)  The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 30 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.

        (ii)  The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later. The prompt payment standards for commercial delivery payments shall be the same as specified in FAR Subpart 32.9 for invoice payments for the item delivered.

        (g)  Installment payment financing shall not be used for DoD contracts, unless market research has established that this form of contract financing is both appropriate and customary in the commercial marketplace. When installment payment financing is used, the contracting officer shall use the ceiling percentage of contract price that is customary in the particular marketplace (not to exceed the maximum rate established in FAR 52.232-30).

        (1) Is a means of financing the performance of more than one contract held by a single contractor;

        (2) Is especially convenient for the financing of cost-type contracts with nonprofit educational or research institutions for experimental or research and development work when several contracts require financing by advance payments. When appropriate, pooled advance payments may also be used to finance other types of contracts held by a single contractor; and

        (3) May be established—

        (i) Without regard to the number of appropriations involved;

        (ii) To finance contracts for one or more department(s) or contracting activity(ies); or

        (iii) In addition to any other advance payment pool agreement at a single contractor location when it is more convenient or otherwise preferable to have more than one agreement.

      Subpart 232.9—Prompt Payment

        232.901   Applicability.

#### § 232.901

        (1) Except for FAR 32.908, FAR subpart 32.9, Prompt Payment, does not apply when—

        (i) There is—

        (A) An emergency, as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974;

        (B) A contingency operation ( FAR 2.101(b)); or

        (C) The release or threatened release of hazardous substances (as defined in 4 U.S.C. 9606, section 106); and

        (ii) The head of the contracting activity has made a determination, after consultation with the cognizant comptroller, that conditions exist that limit normal business operations; and

        (iii) Payments will be made in the operational area or made contingent upon receiving supporting documentation ( contract, invoice, and receiving report) from the operational area.

        (2) Criteria limiting normal business operations during emergencies and contingency operations that restrict the use of FAR 32.9 may include such conditions as—

        (i) Support infrastructure, hardware, communications capabilities, and bandwidth are not consistently available such that normal business operations can be carried out;

        (ii) Support resources, facilities, and banking needs are not consistently available for use as necessary in carrying out normal business operations;

        (iii) Military mission priorities override the availability of appropriately skilled personnel in support of back-office operations;

        (iv) Mobility impairments and security concerns restrict free movement of personnel and documents necessary for timely processing;

        (v) Foreign vendors are not familiar with or do not understand DoD contract requirements ( proper invoice, receiving documentation, and contracting terms); or

        (vi) Documents received in support of payment requests and shipments require language translations that cannot be performed and documented within normal business processing times.

        (3)  The head of the contracting activity shall make subsequent determinations, after consultation with the cognizant comptroller, as the operational area evolves into either a more stable or less stable environment.

        (i) If the head of the contracting activity determines that the operational area has evolved into a more stable environment, the contracting officer shall notify, by issuance of a contract modification, each contractor performing in the operational area under review. The modification deactivates clause 252.232-7011 and activates the applicable FAR Prompt Payment clause in the contract.

        (ii) If after deactivation of clause 252.232-7011, the head of the contracting activity subsequently determines that the operational area has evolved into a less stable environment, the head of the contracting activity will make a determination that conditions exist that limit normal business operations. The contracting officer will then reactivate clause 252.232-7011 by issuance of a contract modification.

#### § 232.904

        (d) In most cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur within the 7-day constructive acceptance period specified in the FAR Prompt Payment clauses. Government payment of construction progress payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14-day period allowed by the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period specified in the contract is not reasonable or practical, such change should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is not authorized.

        (ii) The restrictions of FAR 32.906 prohibiting early payment do not apply to invoice payments made to small business concerns. However, contractors shall not be entitled to interest penalties if the Government fails to make early payment.

        232.1001   Policy.

#### § 232.1001

        (a) As with all contract financing, the purpose of performance-based payments is to assist the contractor in the payment of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. See PGI 232.1001(a) for additional information on use of performance-based payments. However, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3802(a)(2), performance-based payments shall not be conditioned upon costs incurred in contract performance, but on the achievement of performance outcomes. Subject to the criteria in 232.1003-70, all companies, including nontraditional defense contractors, are eligible for performance-based payments, consistent with best commercial practices.

        (d) The contracting officer shall use the following standard payment terms for performance-based payments: The contractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.

#### § 232.1004

        (b)  (i) The contracting officer should include in a solicitation both the progress payments and performance-based payments provisions and clauses prescribed in this part, when considering both types of payment methods. Only one type of financing will be included in the resultant contract, except as may be authorized on separate orders subject to FAR 32.1003(c)).

        (ii) The contracting officer shall analyze the performance-based payment schedule using the performance-based payments (PBP) analysis tool. The PBP analysis tool is on the Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy website in the Price, Cost and Finance section. The PBP analysis tool and Performance Based Payments Guidebook are available at

        (A) When considering performance-based payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events, completion criteria and event values along with the projected monthly expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance events such that the performance-based payments are not expected to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor investment in the contract. If performance-based payments are deemed practical, the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the performance-based payments schedule.

        (B) For modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments financing, the basis for negotiation must include performance-based payments. The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help determine the price for the modification.

        (iii) The contracting officer shall document in the contract file that the performance-based payment schedule provides a mutually beneficial settlement position that reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved contractor cash flow.

        (c)  If the contract contains foreign military sales requirements, the contracting officer shall provide instructions for distribution of the contract financing payments to each country's account.

#### § 232.072-1

      The contracting officer shall perform a financial review when the contracting officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, the contracting officer shall consider performing a financial review—

      (a) Prior to award of a contract, when—

      (1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or other special clearance before award;

      (2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is otherwise known to be indebted to the Government;

      (4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or

      (5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.

      (b) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when—

      (1) Any of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this subsection are applicable; or

#### § 232.072-2

      (a) The contracting officer shall obtain the type and depth of financial and other information that is required to establish a contractor's financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial condition. While the contracting officer should not request information that is not necessary for protection for the Government's interests, the contracting officer must insist upon obtaining the information that is necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects for contract completion.

      (b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the contracting officer concludes that information not listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this subsection is required to comply with 232.072-1, that information should be requested. The information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the contracting officer shall obtain the required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner:

      (1) Balance sheet and income statement—

      (i) For the current fiscal year (interim);

      (ii) For the most recent fiscal year and, preferably, for the 2 preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an independent public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and

      (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.

      (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or personal, and describing its products or services.

      (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing—

      (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;

      (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;

      (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, directors, major stockholders; and

      (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-traded, publicly-held corporation.

      (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate—

      (i) Planned for the current year;

      (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and

      (iii) Deferred to future periods.

      (5) Business base and forecast that—

      (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and

      (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.

      (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract (see 232.072-3).

      (7) Financing arrangement information that discloses—

      (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;

      (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's demands;

      (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with Government title terms under contract financing;

      (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable qualifications;

      (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/repayment suspensions.

      (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, including special mandatory contributions, e.g., environmental superfund.

      (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues such as—

      (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty arrangements;

      (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;

      (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or contractor debt load;

      (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;

      (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, environmental, or product liabilities;

      (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, as assets; and

      (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.

      (10) Significant ratios such as—

      (i) Inventory to annual sales;

      (ii) Inventory to current assets;

      (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;

      (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;

      (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and

      (vi) Net worth to net debt.

> [63 FR 11535, Mar. 9, 1998]

      232.072-3   Cash flow forecasts.

#### § 232.072-3

      (a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract. When there is doubt regarding the sufficiency of a contractor's cash flow, the contracting officer should require the contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the contract.

      (b) A contractor's inability of refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.

      (c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward survey situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.

      (d) Cash flow forecasts must—

      (1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within the entire business unit responsible for contract performance, period by period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash crisis ends); and

      (2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to prepare it.

      (e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions on which they are based. Most important of these assumptions are—

      (1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and services;

      (2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments of purchase or production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;

      (3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;

      (4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, both direct and indirect;

      (5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production schedules;

      (6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including progress payments), and customer payments;

      (7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and

      (8) Estimated amount and timing of cash receipt from other sources.

      (f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the assumptions are reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with—

      (1) The contractor;

      (2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, production, cost, and price analysis; or

      (3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.

        (3) Provide the national stock number (NSN) for the comparable commercial product, if one is assigned, and the NSN for the subsystem, component, or spare part, if one is assigned; or

        (4) If the offeror does not sell a comparable commercial product to the general public or nongovernmental entities for other than governmental purposes, then the offeror is required to—

        (i) Notify the contracting officer in writing that it does not sell such a comparable product; and

        (ii) Provide the contracting officer a comparison between the physical characteristics and functionality of the most comparable commercial product in the commercial market and the subsystem, component, or spare part, if available.

        (e)  For products relying on paragraph (3)(ii) of the “commercial product” definition at FAR 2.101, see FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(C). See 212.209(a) for requirements of 10 U.S.C. 3453 with regard to market research.

        (1) Unless an exception at FAR 15.403-1(b)(1) or (2) applies—

        (i) To the extent necessary to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit to or provide the contracting officer access to a representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of prices paid for the same or similar commercial products under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers and the terms and conditions of such sales; or

        (ii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide or give access to sufficient information described in this paragraph (e)(1) to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit or provide the contracting officer access to a representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of the prices paid for the same or similar commercial products sold under different terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of such sales.

        (2) The contracting officer shall allow the offeror to redact only information provided pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section that identifies the customer, if the offeror certifies in writing for each sale that the customer is a—

        (i) Government customer (e.g., Federal, State, local, or foreign government);

        (ii) Commercial customer purchasing the product for governmental purposes; or

        (iii) Commercial customer purchasing the product for a commercial, mixed, or unknown purpose.

        (3) If the contracting officer determines that the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price because the comparable commercial product provided by the offeror is not a valid basis for price analysis or the proposed price is not reasonable after evaluating sales data, then the contracting officer shall obtain approval from an official one level above the contracting officer, without power of delegation, and require the offeror to submit other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

        (4) An offeror shall not be required to submit information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item. An offeror may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.

        (5) An offeror may submit information or analysis relating to the value of a commercial product to aid in the determination of the reasonableness of the price of such commercial product. A contracting officer may consider such information or analysis in addition to the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For additional guidance see PGI 234.7002(e)(5).

      235.015-70   Special use allowances for research facilities acquired by educational institutions.

#### § 235.015-70

      (a)  As used in this subsection—

      (1)  means—

      (i) Real property, other than land; and

      (ii) Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with departments and agencies of the DoD.

      (2)  means a negotiated direct or indirect allowance—

      (i) For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and real property, other than land; and

      (ii) Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the rate which normally would be allowed under FAR subpart 31.3.

      (b)  (1) Educational institutions are to furnish the facilities necessary to perform Defense contracts. FAR 31.3 governs how much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research programs. However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give special use allowances to an educational institution when the institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or expanded facilities needed for Defense contracts.

      (2) Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (c)  The head of a contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of the following conditions are met—

      (1) The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD contracts;

      (2) Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot meet program requirements practically or effectively;

      (3) The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound business arrangement;

      (4) The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is undesirable or impractical; and

      (5) The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct essential Government research which requires the new or expanded facilities.

      (d)  (1) In negotiating a special use allowance—

      (i) Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;

      (ii) Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special use allowance;

      (iii) Do not include or allow—

      (A) The costs of land; or

      (B) Interest charges on capital;

      (iv) Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational costs;

      (v) The period of allowance generally will be—

      (A) At least ten years; or

      (B) A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;

      (vi) Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;

      (vii) Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the Government has contracts in effect with the institution. However, if in any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to the Government research funding, a separate special use allowance may be negotiated for that year;

      (viii) Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used for Government research during that period.

      (2) A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.

      (i) When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor depreciation will apply—

      (A) During the special use allowance period; and

      (B) After the educational institution has recovered the total construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.

      (ii) When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and depreciation—

      (A) Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; and

      (B) Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for normal use allowance applied to the balance.

      (3) During the special use allowance period, the research facility—

      (i) Shall be available for Government research use on a priority basis over nongovernment use; and

      (ii) Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.

      (4) The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the research facility for parties other than the Government during the period when the special use allowance is in effect.

      (5) In no event shall the institution be paid more than the acquisition costs.

        (ii) Dual language forms and contracts.

        (3) Rates established by an independent regulatory body—

        (i) Are considered “prices set by law or regulation”;

        (ii) Are sufficient to set prices without obtaining certified cost or pricing data (see FAR subpart 15.4); and

        (iii) Are a valid basis on which prices can be determined fair and reasonable.

        241.202   Procedures.

#### § 241.202

        (1)  The Government may pay a connection charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary connecting facilities. A connection charge based on the estimated labor cost of installing and removing the facility shall not include salvage cost. A lump-sum connection charge shall be no more than the agreed cost of the connecting facilities less net salvage. The order of precedence for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is—

        (i) No connection charge.

        (ii) Termination liability. Use when an obligation is necessary to secure the required services. The obligation must be not more than the agreed connection charge, less any net salvage material costs. Use of a termination liability instead of a connection charge requires the approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.

        (iii) Connection charge, refundable. Use a refundable connection charge when the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up-front funding. The contract should provide for refund of the connection charge within five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.

        (iv) Connection and service charges, nonrefundable. The Government may pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership fees, and charges required by the supplier's rules and regulations to be paid by the customer. If possible, consider sharing with other than Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large nonrefundable charges are required.

        (2)  Follow the procedures at PGI 241.202(2) for construction and labor requirements associated with connection and service charges.

        (2) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at FAR 52.241-8, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Unregulated Services, when the utility services to be provided are not subject to a regulatory body or are subject to a nonindependent regulatory body.

        means a contract that is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards under 41 U.S.C. chapter 15, as implemented in regulations found at 48 CFR 9903.201-1 (10 U.S.C. 3841 note prec., as amended by section 816 of Pub. L. 112-81).

        (b)  If the contracting officer makes a final determination to disapprove a contractor's business system in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the contracting officer shall—

        (1) In accordance with agency procedures, identify one or more covered contracts containing the clause at 252.242-7005 from which payments will be withheld. When identifying the covered contracts from which to withhold payments, the contracting officer shall ensure that the total amount of payment withholding under 252.242-7005 does not exceed 10 percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts billed under each of the identified covered contracts. Similarly, the contracting officer shall ensure that the total amount of payment withholding under the clause at 252.242-7005 for each business system does not exceed 5 percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts billed under each of the identified covered contracts. The contracting officer has the sole discretion to identify the covered contracts from which to withhold payments.

        (2) Promptly notify the contractor, in writing, of the contracting officer's determination to implement payment withholding in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005. The notice of payment withholding shall be included in the contracting officer's written final determination for the contractor business system and shall inform the contractor that—

        (i) Payments shall be withheld from the contract or contracts identified in the written determination in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, until the contracting officer determines that there are no remaining material weaknesses; and

        (ii) The contracting officer reserves the right to take other actions within the terms and conditions of the contract.

        (3) Provide a copy of the determination to all contracting officers administering the selected contracts from which payments will be withheld. The contracting officer shall also provide a copy of the determination to the auditor; payment office; affected contracting officers at the buying activities; and cognizant contracting officers in contract administration activities.

        (c)  The contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, shall monitor the contractor's progress in correcting the weaknesses. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor of any decision to decrease or increase the amount of payment withholding in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005.

If, after receipt of verification, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all material weaknesses as directed by the contracting officer's final determination, the contracting officer shall discontinue the withholding of payments, release any payments previously withheld, and approve the system, unless other material weaknesses remain.

        (2) Prior to the receipt of verification, the contracting officer may discontinue withholding payments pending receipt of verification, and release any payments previously withheld, if the contractor submits evidence that the material weaknesses have been corrected, and the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the material weaknesses.

        (3) Within 90 days of receipt of the contractor notification that the contractor has corrected the material weaknesses, the contracting officer shall—

        (i) Make a determination that—

        (A) The contractor has corrected all material weaknesses as directed by the contracting officer's final determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

        (B) There is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or

        (C) The contractor has not corrected all material weaknesses as directed by the contracting officer's final determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or there is not a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or

        (ii) Reduce withholding directly related to the material weaknesses covered under the corrective action plan by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to reduce the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers by at least 50 percent, until the contracting officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

        (4) If, at any time, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has failed to correct the material weaknesses identified in the contractor's notification, the contracting officer will continue, reinstate, or increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to continue, reinstate, or increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all material weaknesses as directed by the contracting officer's final determination.

        (e)  For sample formats for written notifications of contracting officer determinations to initiate payment withholding, reduce payment withholding, and discontinue payment withholding in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, see PGI 242.7000.

        (1)

        (i)  A contractor may use Government property on work for foreign governments and international organizations only when approved in writing by the contracting officer having cognizance of the property. The contracting officer may grant approval, provided—

        (A) The use will not interfere with foreseeable requirements of the United States;

        (B) The work is undertaken as a DoD foreign military sale; or

        (C) For a direct commercial sale, the foreign country or international organization would be authorized to contract with the department concerned under the Arms Export Control Act.

        (ii)

        (A) The Use and Charges clause is applicable on direct commercial sales to foreign governments or international organizations.

        (3)

        (i) Rental charges for use of U.S. production and research property on commercial sales transactions to the Government of Canada are waived for all commercial contracts. This waiver is based on an understanding wherein the Government of Canada has agreed to waive its rental charges.

        (ii) Requests for waiver or reduction of charges for the use of Government property on work for foreign governments or international organizations shall be submitted to the contracting officer, who is authorized to approve the requests in consultation with the appropriate functional specialist.

      Subpart 247.5—Ocean Transportation by U.S.-Flag Vessels

        247.570   Scope.

#### § 247.570

        This subpart—

        (a) Implements—

        (1) The Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (“the 1904 Act”), 10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of cargo owned by, destined for use by, or otherwise transported by DoD;

        (2) Section 1017 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364) (10 U.S.C. 2631 note), which requires consideration, in solicitations requiring a covered vessel, of the extent to which offerors have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work performed in shipyards located in the United States or Guam;

        (3) Section 3504 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) (10 U.S.C. chapter 257 note), which addresses requirements that apply to riding gang members and DoD-exempted individuals (see 252.247-7027(c)) who perform work on U.S.-flag vessels under DoD contracts for transportation services documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121; and

        (4) Section 1024 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Pub. L. 116-283), which updates the listed circumstances where DoD may waive the requirement that DoD supplies be transported by sea in vessels belonging to the United States or vessels of the United States, and it modifies the requirement for reflagging or repair work in the United States for vessels used under time-charter contracts.

        (b) Does not specifically implement the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (“the 1954 Act”), 46 U.S.C. chapter 553.

        (e) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will continue administering contracts that the U.S. contracting officer terminates.

        (f) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will settle all Canadian subcontracts in accordance with the policies, practices, and procedures of the Canadian Government.

        (a)  As used in this clause—

        means an employee who has been granted access to classified information; or employees in other positions that the Contractor determines involve national security, health or safety, or functions other than the foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.

        means controlled substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) of title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is unlawful under chapter 13 of that title. The term “illegal drugs” does not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.

        (b) The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving the objective of a drug-free work force. While this clause defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph (c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.

        (c) Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate alternatives:

        (1) Employee assistance programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;

        (2) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by Contractor employees;

        (3) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues;

        (4) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis. Employee drug testing programs shall be established taking account of the following:

        (i) The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.

        (ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for employee drug testing—

        (A) When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses illegal drugs; or

        (B) When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe practice;

        (C) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use;

        (D) As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.

        (iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for employment for illegal drug use.

        (iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for illegal drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is prescribed by section 2.1 of subpart B of the “Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs” (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.

        (d) Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally. Contractors shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs until such times as the Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, determines that the employee may perform in such a position.

        (e) The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.

        (k)  (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when—

        (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or

        (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.

        (2) The limitation in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause—

        (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

        (l)  (1) The Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 3771-3775, 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786, 15 U.S.C. 638(j)(1)(B)(iii) and (v), and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (f) of this clause are recognized and protected.

        (2) Whenever any other than commercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use the following clause(s) in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties:

        (i) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this clause, use this clause to govern SBIR/STTR data.

        (ii) For data that are not SBIR/STTR data—

        (A) Use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7015, Technical Data—Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed exclusively at private expense;

        (B) Use the DFARS clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, to govern other than commercial computer software and computer software documentation; and

        (C) Use the license under which the data are customarily provided to the public, in accordance with DFARS 227.7202, for commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation.

        (iii) No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.

        (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

        (4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.

        (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
