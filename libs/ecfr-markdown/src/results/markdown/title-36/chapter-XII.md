In addition, NARA thereafter ensures that the credit reporting agency is promptly informed of any substantive change in the conditions or amount of the debt, and promptly verifies or corrects information relevant to the debt.

        (d) If a debtor disputes the validity of the debt, the credit reporting agency refers the matter to the appropriate NARA official. The credit reporting agency excludes the debt from its reports until NARA certifies in writing that the debt is valid.

        (e) NARA may disclose to a commercial credit bureau information concerning a commercial debt, including the following:

        (1) Information necessary to establish the name, address, and employer identification number of the commercial debtor;

        (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and

        (3) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.

        § 1201.13   How will NARA contract for collection services?

#### § § 1201.13

        NARA uses the services of a private collection contractor where it determines that such use is in NARA's best interest. When NARA determines that there is a need to contract for collection services, NARA:

        (a) Retains sole authority to:

        (1) Resolve any dispute with the debtor regarding the validity of the debt;

        (2) Compromise the debt;

        (3) Suspend or terminate collection action;

        (4) Refer the debt to the DOJ for litigation; and

        (5) Take any other action under this part;

        (b) Requires the contractor to comply with the:

        (1) Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m);

        (2) Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692-1692o); and

        (3) Other applicable Federal and State laws pertaining to debt collection practices and applicable regulations of NARA in this part;

        (c) Requires the contractor to account accurately and fully for all amounts collected; and

        (d) Requires the contractor to provide to NARA, upon request, all data and reports contained in its files related to its collection actions on a debt.

        § 1201.14   What should I expect to receive from NARA if I owe a debt to NARA?

#### § § 1201.14

        (a) NARA will send you a written notice when we determine that you owe a debt to NARA. The notice will be hand-delivered or sent to you at the most current address known to NARA. The notice will inform you of the following:

        (1) The amount, nature, and basis of the debt;

        (2) That a designated NARA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid;

        (3) That payment of the debt is due as of the date of the notice, and that the debt will be considered delinquent if you do not pay it within 30 days of the date of the notice;

        (4) NARA's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs ( § 1201.18), including a statement that such assessments must be made against you unless excused in accordance with the FCCS and this part;

        (5) That you have the right to inspect and copy disclosable NARA records pertaining to your debt, or to receive copies of those records if personal inspection is impractical;

        (6) That you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement, in writing and signed by both you and the designated NARA official, for voluntary repayment of the debt ( § 1201.19);

        (7) The address, telephone number, and name of the NARA official available to discuss the debt;

        (8) Possible collection actions that might be taken if the debt is not paid within 60 days of the notice, or arrangements to pay the debt are not made within 60 days of the notice ( § 1201.15 for a fuller description of possible actions);

        (9) That NARA may suspend or revoke any licenses, permits, or other privileges for failure to pay a debt; and

        (10) Information on your opportunity to obtain a review of the debt ( § 1201.16).

        (b) NARA will respond promptly to communications from you.

        (c) Exception to entitlement to notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions. With respect to the regulations covering internal salary offset collections ( § 1230.32), NARA excepts from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section—

        (1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over 4 pay periods or less;

        (2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the 4 pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or

        (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.

        § 1201.15   What will the notice tell me regarding collection actions that might be taken if the debt is not paid within 60 days of the notice, or arrangements to pay the debt are not made within 60 days of the notice?

#### § § 1201.15

        The notice provided under § 1201.14 will advise you that within 60 days of the date of the notice, your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) must be paid or you must enter into a voluntary repayment agreement. If you do not pay the debt or enter into the agreement within that deadline, NARA may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods:

        (a) By referral to a credit reporting agency ( § 1201.12), private collection contractor ( § 1201.13), or the DOJ ( § 1201.11).

        (b) By transferring any debt to the Treasury for collection, including under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury ( § 1201.10).

        (c) If you are a NARA employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full ( subpart C of this part). NARA will specify the amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the deduction. 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 govern such proceedings;

        (d) If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than NARA, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency ( subpart C of this part). 5 U.S.C. 5514 governs such proceedings;

        (e) By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax ( subpart D of this part);

        (f) By administrative offset ( subpart E of this part);

        (g) By administrative wage garnishment ( subpart F of this part); or

        (h) By liquidation of security or collateral. NARA has the right to hold security or collateral, liquidate it, and apply the proceeds to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a foreclosure. NARA will not follow the procedures in this paragraph (h) if the cost of disposing the collateral will be disproportionate to its value.

        § 1201.16   What will the notice tell me about my opportunity for review of my debt?

#### § § 1201.16

        The notice provided by NARA under §§ 1201.14 and 1201.15 will also advise you of the opportunity to obtain a review within NARA concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments. The notice will also advise you of the following:

        (a) The name, address, and telephone number of a NARA official whom you may contact concerning procedures for requesting a review;

        (b) The method and time period for requesting a review;

        (c) That the filing of a request for a review on or before the 60th day following the date of the notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

        (d) The name and address of the NARA official to whom you should send the request for a review;

        (e) That a final decision on the review (if one is requested) will be issued in writing at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings;

        (f) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject you to:

        (1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statute or regulations;

        (2) Penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) or any other applicable statutory authority; and

        (3) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or any other applicable statutory authority;

        (g) Any other rights available to you to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived, or remedies available to you under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

        (h) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt that are later waived or found not owed will be promptly refunded to you.

        § 1201.17   What must I do to obtain a review of my debt, and how will the review process work?

#### § § 1201.17

        (a)  (1) You have the right to request a review by NARA of the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. If you want a review, you must send a written request to the NARA official designated in the notice ( § 1201.16(d)).

        (2) You must sign your request for review and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.

        (3) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of NARA on or before the 60th calendar day following the date of the notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. NARA may consider requests filed after the 60-day period provided for in this section if you:

        (i) Can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control; or

        (ii) Did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline).

        (b)  (1) If you want to inspect or copy NARA records related to the debt ( § 1201.14(a)(5)), you must send a letter to the NARA official designated in the notice. Your letter must be received within 30 days of the date of the notice.

        (2) In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated NARA official will notify you of the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to the debt.

        (3) If personal inspection of NARA records related to the debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you copies of those records.

        (c)  (1) When required by Federal law or regulation, such as in a salary offset situation, NARA will request an administrative law judge, or hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision ( paragraph (f) of this section for content of the review decision).

        (2) When Federal law or regulation does not require NARA to have the review conducted by an administrative law judge, or by a hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, NARA has the right to appoint a hearing official to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision ( paragraph (f) of this section for the content of the review decision).

        (d)  If you request a review, the review official will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review official will determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the FCCS. Although you may request an oral hearing, such a hearing is required only when a review of the documentary evidence cannot determine the question of indebtedness, such as when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or truthfulness. In either case, the review official will conduct the review in accordance with the FCCS. If the review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing.

        (e)  (1) The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing. This decision will be issued as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date on which NARA received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.

        (2) If NARA is unable to issue a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for a hearing:

        (i) NARA may not issue a withholding order or take other action until the hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered; and

        (ii) If NARA previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, NARA must suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered.

        (f)  The review official will prepare a written decision that includes:

        (1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

        (2) The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and

        (3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.

        (g)  Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.

        § 1201.18   What interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will I have to pay on a debt owed to NARA?

#### § § 1201.18

        (a)  (1) NARA will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.

        (2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. NARA will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. NARA will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of NARA or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. NARA will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of NARA.

        (3) The Archivist may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of NARA. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review.

        (b)  NARA will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.

        (c)  NARA will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of NARA.

        (d)  A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.

        (e)  NARA may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.

        (f)  (1) The Archivist may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of NARA.

        (2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, and unless otherwise stated in these regulations, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Archivist's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.

        § 1201.19   How can I resolve my debt through voluntary repayment?

#### § § 1201.19

        (a) In response to a notice of debt, you may propose to NARA that you be allowed to repay the debt through a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of NARA taking other collection actions under this part.

        (b) Your request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement must:

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Admit the existence of the debt; and

        (3) Either propose payment of the debt (together with interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) in a lump sum, or set forth a proposed repayment schedule.

        (c) NARA will collect claims in one lump sum whenever feasible. However, if you are unable to pay your debt in one lump sum, NARA may accept payment in regular installments that bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and your ability to pay.

        (d) NARA will consider a request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement in accordance with the FCCS. The Archivist may request additional information from you, including financial statements if you request to make payments in installments, in order to determine whether to accept a voluntary repayment agreement. It is within the Archivist's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding with other collection actions under this part, and to set the necessary terms of any voluntary repayment agreement. No repayment agreement will be binding on NARA unless it is in writing and signed by both you and the Archivist. At NARA's option, you may be required to provide security as part of the agreement to make payments in installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 31 U.S.C. 3711 will govern any reduction or compromise of a claim.

        § 1201.20   What is the extent of the Archivist's authority to compromise debts owed to NARA, or to suspend or terminate collection action on such debts?

#### § § 1201.20

        (a) The Archivist may compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action on those debts owed to NARA that do not exceed $100,000 excluding interest, in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. NARA will follow the policies in § 902.2 of the FCCS.

        (b) The uncollected portion of a debt owed to NARA that is not recovered as the result of a compromise will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as income to the debtor in accordance with IRS procedures if the debt is at least $600.00.

        § 1201.21   May NARA's failure to comply with these regulations be used as a defense to a debt?

#### § § 1201.21

        No, the failure of NARA to comply with any standard in the FCCS or these regulations will not be available to any debtor as a defense.

      Subpart C—Salary Offset

        § 1201.30   What debts are included or excluded from coverage of these regulations on salary offset?

#### § § 1201.30

        (a) The regulations in this subpart provide NARA procedures for the collection by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain debts owed to NARA or to other Federal agencies.

        (b) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.

        (c) Nothing in the regulations in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, or the FCCS.

        (d) A levy imposed under the Internal Revenue Code takes precedence over a salary offset under this subpart, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).

        § 1201.31   May I ask NARA to waive an overpayment that otherwise would be collected by offsetting my salary as a Federal employee?

#### § § 1201.31

        Yes, the regulations in this subpart do not preclude you from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.

        § 1201.32   What are NARA's procedures for salary offset?

#### § § 1201.32

        (a) NARA will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.

        (b) If you are a NARA employee who owes a debt to NARA, NARA's payroll office will determine the amount of your disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.

        (c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by NARA's payroll office of certification of debt from the creditor agency.

        (d) The Notice provisions of these regulations do not apply to certain debts arising under this section ( § 1201.14(c)).

        (e) Types of collection. (1)  If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.

        (2)  Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and your ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless you have agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.

        (3)  A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.

        (4)  If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from NARA and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, NARA may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS.

        (f)  In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, NARA's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.

        § 1201.33   How will NARA coordinate salary offsets with other agencies?

#### § § 1201.33

        (a)  Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716, NARA must submit a claim to a paying agency or disbursing official.

        (1) In its claim, NARA must certify, in writing, the following:

        (i) That the employee owes the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) The date NARA's right to collect the debt first accrued;

        (iv) That NARA's regulations in this subpart have been approved by OPM under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; and

        (v) That NARA has met the certification requirements of the paying agency.

        (2) If the collection must be made in installments, NARA's claim will also advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. NARA may also advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected and the date of the first installment, if that date is other than the next officially established pay period.

        (3) NARA will also include in its claim:

        (i) The employee's written consent to the salary offset;

        (ii) The employee's signed statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514; or

        (iii) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the actions taken and the dates of those actions.

        (4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, NARA must submit its claim to the paying agency or disbursing official for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency will (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and NARA. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal government sources, then (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, NARA must submit a properly certified claim under this paragraph (a)(4) to the agency responsible for making the other payments before the collection can be made.

        (5) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, NARA may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be administratively offset to collect the debt.

        (6)  When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, NARA will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. NARA will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

        (b)  (1) Complete claim. When NARA receives a certified claim from a creditor agency (under the creditor agency's regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, NARA sends the employee a written notice containing:

        (i) A statement that NARA has received a certified claim from the creditor agency;

        (ii) The amount of the claim;

        (iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin; and

        (iv) The amount of such deductions.

        (2) Incomplete claim. When NARA receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, NARA will return the claim with a notice that the creditor agency must:

        (i) Comply with the procedures required under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and

        (ii) Properly certify a claim to NARA before NARA will take action to collect from the employee's current pay account.

        (3) NARA is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.

        (4) Employees who transfer from NARA to another paying agency. If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim to NARA, the employee transfers from NARA to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, NARA will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.

        § 1201.34   Under what conditions will NARA make a refund of amounts collected by salary offset?

#### § § 1201.34

        (a) If NARA is the creditor agency, it will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:

        (1) The debt is waived or all or part of the funds deducted are otherwise found not to be owed (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or

#### § § 1201.40

        (a) The regulations in this subpart implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the Treasury to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency.

      Subpart E—Administrative Offset

        § 1201.50   Under what circumstances will NARA collect amounts that I owe to NARA (or some other Federal agency) by offsetting the debt against payments that NARA (or some other Federal agency) owes me?

#### § § 1201.50

        (a) The regulations in this subpart apply to the collection of any debts you owe to NARA, or to any request from another Federal agency that NARA collect a debt you owe by offsetting your debt against a payment NARA owes you. Administrative offset is authorized under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3716). NARA will carry out administrative offset in accordance with the provisions of the FCCS. The regulations in this subpart are intended only to supplement the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

        (b) The Archivist, after attempting to collect a debt you owe to NARA under Section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset only after giving you:

        (1) Written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor;

        (2) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;

        (3) An opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and

        (4) An opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.

        (c) No collection by administrative offset will be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years, unless facts material to NARA or a Federal agency's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting the debt.

        (d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to:

        (1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly prohibited by statute; or

        (2) Debts owed to NARA by Federal agencies.

        § 1201.51   How will NARA request that my debt to NARA be collected by offset against some payment that another Federal agency owes me?

#### § § 1201.51

        The Archivist may request that funds due and payable to you by another Federal agency instead be paid to NARA to satisfy a debt you owe to NARA. NARA will refer debts to the Treasury for centralized administrative offset in accordance with the FCCS and the procedures established by the Treasury. Where centralized offset is not available or appropriate, NARA may request offset directly from the Federal agency that is holding funds for you. In requesting administrative offset, NARA will certify in writing to the Federal agency that is holding funds for you:

        (a) That you owe the debt;

        (b) The amount and basis of the debt; and

        (c) That NARA has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations in this subpart, the applicable administrative offset regulations of the agency holding the funds, and the applicable provisions of the FCCS with respect to providing you with due process.

        § 1201.52   What procedures will NARA use to collect amounts I owe to a Federal agency by offsetting a payment that NARA would otherwise make to me?

#### § § 1201.52

        (a) Any Federal agency may request that NARA administratively offset funds due and payable to you in order to collect a debt you owe to that agency. NARA will initiate the requested offset only upon:

        (1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:

        (i) That you owe the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and

        (iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of the FCCS, including providing you with any required hearing or review; and

        (2) A determination by the Archivist that offsetting funds payable to you by NARA in order to collect a debt owed by you would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.

        (b)  In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking administrative offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, NARA may, in its discretion, allocate the amount it owes to you to the creditor agencies in accordance with the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

        § 1201.53   When may NARA make an offset in an expedited manner?

#### § § 1201.53

        NARA may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to you before completion of the procedures required by §§ 1201.51 and 1201.52 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize NARA's ability to collect the debt and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. An expedited offset will be followed promptly by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset, but later found not to be owed to the United States, will be promptly refunded.

        § 1201.54   Can a judgment I have obtained against the United States be used to satisfy a debt that I owe to NARA?

#### § § 1201.54

        Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States will be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728 and 31 U.S.C. 3716.

      Subpart F—Administrative Wage Garnishment

        § 1201.55   How will NARA collect debts through Administrative Wage Garnishment?

#### § § 1201.55

        NARA will collect debts through Administrative Wage Garnishment in accordance with the Administrative Wage Garnishment regulations issued by the Treasury. NARA adopts, for the purposes of this subpart, the Treasury's Administrative Wage Garnishment regulations in 31 CFR 285.11.

#### § § 1202.66

        (a) Except for disclosures made to NARA employees in the course of the performance of their duties or when required by the Freedom of Information Act (see § 1202.60(a) and (b)), NARA keeps an accurate accounting of each disclosure and retains it for 5 years after the disclosure or for the life of the record, whichever is longer. The accounting includes the:

Procedures for requesting access to the accounting of disclosures are in subpart C.

      Subpart E—Request To Amend Records

        § 1202.70   Whom should I contact at NARA to amend records about myself?

#### § § 1202.70

        If you believe that a record that NARA maintains about you is not accurate, timely, relevant or complete, you may request that the record be amended. Write to the NARA Privacy Act Officer, Room 3110, 8601 Adelphi Rd, College Park, MD 20470-6001. Employees of NARA who desire to amend their personnel records should write to the Director, Human Resources Services Division. You should include as much information, documentation, or other evidence as needed to support your request to amend the pertinent record. Mark both the envelop and the letter with the phrase “Privacy Act—Request To Amend Record.”

        § 1202.72   How does NARA handle requests to amend records?

#### § § 1202.72

        (a) NARA will acknowledge receipt of a request to amend a record within 10 workdays. If possible, the acknowledgment will include the system manager's determination either to amend the record or to deny your request to amend as provided in § 1202.76.

        (b) When reviewing a record in response to your request to amend, the system manager will assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of the existing record in light of your proposed amendment to determine if your request to amend is justified. If you request the deletion of information, the system manager also will review your request and the existing record to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish NARA's purpose, as required by law or Executive order.

        § 1202.74   How will I know if NARA approved my amendment request?

#### § § 1202.74

        If NARA approves your amendment request, the system manager will promptly make the necessary amendment to the record and will send a copy of the amended record to you. NARA will also advise all previous recipients of the record, using the accounting of disclosures, that an amendment has been made and give the substance of the amendment. Where practicable, NARA will also send a copy of the amended record to previous recipients.

        § 1202.76   Can NARA deny my request for amendment?

#### § § 1202.76

        If the system manager denies your request to amend or determines that the record should be amended in a manner other than that requested by you, NARA will advise you in writing of the decision. The denial letter will state:

        (a) The reasons for the denial of your amendment request;

        (b) Proposed alternative amendments, if appropriate;

        (c) Your right to appeal the denial; and

        (d) The procedures for appealing the denial.

        § 1202.78   How do I accept an alternative amendment?

#### § § 1202.78

        If your request to amend a record is denied and NARA suggested alternative amendments, and you agree to those alternative amendments, you must notify the Privacy Act Officer who will then make the necessary amendments in accordance with § 1202.74.

        § 1202.80   How do I appeal the denial of a request to amend a record?

#### § § 1202.80

        (a) If you disagree with a denial of your request to amend a record, you can file an appeal of that denial.

        (1) Address your appeal of the denial to amend records signed by a system manager other than the Inspector General, to the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official (ND), Room 3110, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740-6001.

        (2) Address the appeal of the denial to amend records signed by the Inspector General to the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official (N), Room 3110, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740-6001.

        (3) For current NARA employees if the denial to amend concerns a record maintained in the employee's Official Personnel Folder or in another Government-wide system maintained by NARA on behalf of another agency, NARA will provide the employee with name and address of the appropriate appeal official in that agency.

        (b) Appeals to NARA must be in writing and must be postmarked no later than 35 calendar days from the date of the NARA denial of a request to amend. Your appeal letter and envelope must be marked “Privacy Act—Appeal”.

        (c) Upon receipt of an appeal, the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official will consult with the system manager, legal counsel, and such other officials as may be appropriate. If the appeal official determines that the record should be amended, he or she will instruct the system manager to amend the record in accordance with § 1202.74 and will notify you of that action.

        (d) If, after consulting with officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official determines that your appeal should be rejected, the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official will notify you in writing of that determination.

In extraordinary circumstances, the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official may extend this time limit by notifying you in writing before the expiration of the 30 workdays. The notification will include a justification for the extension of time.

        § 1202.82   How do I file a Statement of Disagreement?

#### § § 1202.82

        If you receive a NARA final determination denying your request to amend a record, you may file a Statement of Disagreement with the appropriate system manager. The Statement of Disagreement must include an explanation of why you believe the record to be inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The system manager will maintain your Statement of Disagreement in conjunction with the pertinent record. The System Manager will send a copy of the Statement of Disagreement to any person or agency to whom the record has been disclosed, only if the disclosure was subject to the accounting requirements of § 1202.60.

        § 1202.84   Can I seek judicial review?

#### § § 1202.84

        Yes, within 2 years of receipt of a NARA final determination as provided in § 1202.54 or § 1202.80, you may seek judicial review of that determination. You may file a civil action in the Federal District Court:

      Subpart F—Exemptions

        § 1202.90   What NARA systems of records are exempt from release under the National Security Exemption of the Privacy Act?

#### § § 1202.90

        (a) The Investigative Case Files of the Inspector General (NARA-23) and the Personnel Security Case Files (NARA-24) systems of records are eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) because the records in these systems:

        (1) Contain information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and

        (2) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.

        (b) The systems described in paragraph (a) are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), and (e)(4)(G) and (H). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

        (1) From subsection (c)(3) because accounting for each disclosure could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.

        (2) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) because access to the records in these systems of records could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of either of these series of records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement or national security activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

        (3) From subsection (e)(1) because verification of the accuracy of all information to the records could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.

        (4) From subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d), pursuant to subsection (k)(1) of the Privacy Act.

        § 1202.92   What NARA systems of records are exempt from release under the Law Enforcement Exemption of the Privacy Act?

#### § § 1202.92

        (a) The Investigative Files of the Inspector General (NARA-23) and the Insider Threat Program Records (NARA-45) systems of records are eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) because these record systems contain investigatory material of actual, potential, or alleged criminal, civil, or administrative violations, compiled for law enforcement purposes other than within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. If you are denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which you would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which you would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the record, NARA will make the record available to you, except for any information in the record that would disclose the identity of a confidential source as described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

        (b) The systems described in paragraph (a) of this section are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (e)(4), (G) and (H), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

        (1) From subsection (c)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because releasing disclosure accounting could alert the subject of an investigation about the alleged violations, about the existence of the investigation, and about the fact that they are being investigated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Insider Threat Office, or another agency. Releasing these records could provide significant information concerning the nature of the investigation and result in tampering with or destroying evidence, influencing witnesses, endangering individuals involved, and other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation.

        (2) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because access to the information contained in these systems of records could inform the subject of an investigation about an actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violation; about the existence of that investigation; about the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained on the person's activities; about the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and about information that may enable the person to avoid being detected or apprehended. These factors present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement when they prevent investigators from successfully completing the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, or lead to improperly influencing witnesses, destroying evidence, or fabricating testimony. In addition, granting access to such records could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Amending these records could allow the subject to avoid being detected or apprehended and interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities.

        (3) From subsection (e)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because applying this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of the OIG, the Insider Threat Office, or another agency for the following reasons:

        (i) It is not possible to detect relevance or need for specific information in the early stages of an investigation, case, or matter. After the investigators evaluate the information, they may establish its relevance and need.

        (ii) During an investigation, the investigating office may obtain information about other actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violations, including those outside the scope of its jurisdiction. The office should retain this information, as it may help establish patterns of inappropriate activity, and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.

        (iii) When interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, the investigator may receive information that relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may also relate to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another office or agency. The investigator cannot readily segregate such information.

        (4) From subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d), pursuant to subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.

        (5) From subsection (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.

> [81 FR 36802, June 8, 2016]

        § 1202.94   What NARA systems of records are exempt from release under the Investigatory Information Material exemption of the Privacy Act?

#### § § 1202.94

        (a) The Personnel Security Case Files (NARA-24) system of records is eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) because it contains investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal employment or access to classified information. The only information exempt under this provision is that which would disclose the identity of a confidential source described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

        (b) The system of records described in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1). Exemption from the particular subsection is justified as access to records in the system would reveal the identity(ies) of the source(s) of information collected in the course of a background investigation.

#### § § 1208.149

      Except as otherwise provided in § 1208.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

      § 1208.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1208.150

      (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;

      (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

      (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1208.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1208.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1208.150(a)(2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

      (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

      (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

      (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

      (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

      (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

#### § § 1208.151

      Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

      (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

      (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

      (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.

      (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

      (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.

      (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

      (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

      (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1208.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 1211.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

        (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.

        (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

        (c)  (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).

        (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.

#### § § 1211.120

        If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 1211.205 through 1211.235(a).

        § 1211.125   Effect of other requirements.

#### § § 1211.125

        (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

        (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

        § 1211.130   Effect of employment opportunities.

#### § § 1211.130

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 1211.300 through 1211.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 1211.135, or to the designated agency official.

        (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

        (ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every student and employee of such recipient.

        (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by these Title IX regulations.

        (c)  Each recipient shall distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall apprise each of its admission and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall require such representatives to adhere to such policy.

        (d)(1) Nothing in these Title IX regulations shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.

        (b)  (1) In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 1211.300 through 1211.310 apply shall not:

        (i) Give preference to one person over another on the basis of sex, by ranking applicants separately on such basis, or otherwise;

        (ii) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of persons of either sex who may be admitted; or

        (iii) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the basis of sex.

        (2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission that has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria that do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.

        (c)  In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 1211.300 through 1211.310 apply:

        (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;

        (2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice that so discriminates or excludes;

        (3) Subject to § 1211.235(d), shall treat disabilities related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or physical condition; and

        § 1211.305   Preference in admission.

#### § § 1211.305

        A recipient to which §§ 1211.300 through 1211.310 apply shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1211.300 through 1211.310.

        § 1211.310   Recruitment.

#### § § 1211.310

        (4) Subject any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment;

        (5) Apply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a student or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition;

        (6) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students or employees;

        (7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.

Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.

        (d)  (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.

        (2) Such recipient:

        (i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such recipient from taking; and

        (ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such participation if such action occurs.

        § 1211.405   Housing.

#### § § 1211.405

        (A) Proportionate in quantity; and

        (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.

#### § § 1211.415

        (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.

        (b)(1) With respect to classes and activities in physical education at the elementary school level, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. With respect to physical education classes and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

        (2) This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex.

        (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

        (4) Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such effect.

        (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.

        (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.

        (b) Any other school or educational unit operated by such recipient, unless such recipient otherwise makes available to such person, pursuant to the same policies and criteria of admission, courses, services, and facilities comparable to each course, service, and facility offered in or through such schools.

        § 1211.425   Counseling and use of appraisal and counseling materials.

#### § § 1211.425

        (a)  A recipient shall not discriminate against any person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or applicants for admission.

        (b)  A recipient that uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

        (c)  Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.

        (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex; or

        (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.

        (b)  (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein;  that the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.

        (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:

        (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;

        (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

        (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

        (c)  (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.

        (2) A recipient may provide separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of each sex as part of separate athletic teams for members of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph (c) and § 1211.450.

        (a)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to any of its students:

        (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and

        (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.

        (b)  A recipient that employs any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates §§ 1211.500 through 1211.550.

        § 1211.440   Health and insurance benefits and services.

#### § § 1211.440

        Subject to § 1211.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would violate §§ 1211.500 through 1211.550 if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient that provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.

        § 1211.445   Marital or parental status.

#### § § 1211.445

        (a)  A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.

        (b)  (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.

        (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

        (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

        (4) Subject to § 1211.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

        (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

        § 1211.450   Athletics.

#### § § 1211.450

        (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

        (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

        (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

        (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

        (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

        (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;

        (iv) Travel and per diem allowance;

        (v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;

        (vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;

        (vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;

        (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

        (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

        (x) Publicity.

        (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

        (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

#### § § 1211.525

        (a)  For purposes of these Title IX regulations,  means: Any medical, hospital, accident, life insurance, or retirement benefit, service, policy or plan, any profit-sharing or bonus plan, leave, and any other benefit or service of employment not subject to the provision of § 1211.515.

        (c)  (1) No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:

        (i) The designated agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;

        (ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations; and

        (iii) The expiration of 30 days after the Archivist has filed with the committee of the House, and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.

        (2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

        (d)  (1) No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:

        (i) The designated agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;

        (ii) The recipient has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and

        (iii) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient.

        (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1211.615(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:

        (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or

        (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 20 U.S.C. 1682 and § 1211.615(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.

        (b)  Hearings shall be held at the offices of the agency in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the designated agency official unless the official determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the agency requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556(b).

        (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the agency shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

Both the agency and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.

        (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

        (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with these Title IX regulations and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1211.625.

        § 1211.625   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 1211.625

        (a)  After a hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing officer, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the agency may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.

        (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1211.620, the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing officer for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

        (d)  Each decision of a hearing officer or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

        (e)  If the Archivist has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for the agency may request the Archivist to review a decision of the reviewing authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Archivist determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Archivist may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The Archivist may also review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the National Archives and Records Administration. In the absence of a review under this paragraph (e), a final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall become the final decision of the agency when the Archivist transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under 20 U.S.C. 1682. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the reviewing authority or to request review under this paragraph (e) shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.

        (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which these Title IX regulations apply, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title IX and these Title IX regulations, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which these Title IX regulations apply will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to these Title IX regulations, or to have otherwise failed to comply with these Title IX regulations unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the designated agency official that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations.

        (g)  (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with these Title IX regulations and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. An elementary or secondary school or school system that is unable to file an assurance of compliance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation that meets the applicable requirements and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan.

        (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the designated agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the official shall restore such eligibility.

        (3) If the designated agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph (g) are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this section shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the designated official of this agency.

    PART 1212—GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

### Part 1212

**Authority:** Authority: 41 U.S.C. 701,  44 U.S.C. 2104(a).

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66544, 66617, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

        § 1212.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 1212.100

        This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

        § 1212.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1212.105

        (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

        (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the NARA; or

        (2) A(n) NARA awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 1212.605 and 1212.660, respectively.)

        (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

        § 1212.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 1212.110

        This part does not apply to any award that the Archivist of the United States or designee determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

        § 1212.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 1212.115

        It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 1212.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

      Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

        § 1212.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 1212.200

        There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

        (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

        (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 1212.205 through 1212.220); and

        (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 1212.225).

        (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 1212.230).

        § 1212.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1212.205

        You must publish a statement that—

        (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

        (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

        (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

        (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

        (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

        § 1212.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1212.210

        You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 1212.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

        § 1212.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 1212.215

        You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

        (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

        (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

        (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

        (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

        § 1212.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 1212.220

        If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 1212.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 1212.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

        § 1212.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 1212.225

        There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

        (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1212.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Include the employee's position title;

        (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

        (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

        (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

        (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either—

        (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

        (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

        § 1212.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 1212.230

        (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each NARA award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

        (1) To the NARA official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

        (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by NARA officials or their designated representatives.

        (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

        (c) If you identified workplaces to the NARA awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the NARA awarding official.

      Subpart C—Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

        § 1212.300   What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

#### § § 1212.300

        As a condition of receiving a(n) NARA award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that—

        (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and

        (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

        (1) In writing.

        (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

        (3) To the NARA awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 1212.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

        § 1212.301   [Reserved]

#### § § 1212.301

      Subpart D—Responsibilities of NARA Awarding Officials

        § 1212.400   What are my responsibilities as a(n) NARA awarding official?

#### § § 1212.400

        As a(n) NARA awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in—

        (a) Subpart B of this part, if the recipient is not an individual; or

        (b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

      Subpart E—Violations of this Part and Consequences

        § 1212.500   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 1212.500

        A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Archivist of the United States or designee determines, in writing, that—

        (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

        (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

        § 1212.505   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 1212.505

        An individual recipient is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Archivist of the United States or designee determines, in writing, that—

        (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart C of this part; or

        (b) The recipient is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity.

        § 1212.510   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 1212.510

        If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 1212.500 or § 1212.505, the NARA may take one or more of the following actions—

        (a) Suspension of payments under the award;

        (b) Suspension or termination of the award; and

        (c) Suspension or debarment of the recipient under 36 CFR part 1209, for a period not to exceed five years.

> [68 FR 66544, 66617, Nov. 26, 2003, as amended at 68 FR 66617, Nov. 26, 2003]

        § 1212.515   Are there any exceptions to those actions?

#### § § 1212.515

        The Archivist of the United States or designee may waive with respect to a particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the Archivist of the United States or designee determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.

      (a) This part prescribes general procedures that apply to guidance documents NARA and its components issue after April 30, 2020, and to all NARA employees and contractors involved in all phases of developing and issuing policy and guidance.

      (b) This part does not apply to:

      (1) Regulations; although some regulations are subject to rulemaking requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(a), they do not constitute guidance, so are not covered by this rule. In addition, this rule does not apply to regulations exempt from rulemaking requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(a) and regulations of agency organization, procedure, or practice;

      (2) Decisions of agency adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 or similar statutory provisions;

      (3) Internal executive branch legal advice or legal advisory opinions addressed to executive branch officials;

      (6) Agency statements that do not set forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue or an interpretation of a statute or regulation, including speeches and individual presentations, editorials, media interviews, press materials, or congressional testimony that do not set forth for the first time a new regulatory policy or guidance;

      § 1213.4   Requirements for review and clearance.

#### § § 1213.4

      (a) NARA's regulatory office must review and clear, according to this subpart, all NARA guidance documents before we issue them.

      (b) The regulatory office ensures that each guidance document satisfies the following requirements:

      (1) It complies with relevant statutes and regulations, and other applicable authorities;

      (2) It identifies or includes:

      (i) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;

      (ii) The issuing office's name;

      (iii) A unique agency identifier, according to naming conventions we establish, and a z-RIN, if applicable;

      (iv) A concise title;

      (iv) The issuing or effective date;

      (v) An indicator of whether the guidance revises or replaces any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and

      (vi) Appropriate citations to applicable statutes, regulations, and other authorities; and

      (3) It is consistent with NARA policies, guidance, strategic initiatives, and other authorities, is written in plain and understandable English, and meets other guidance and policy analysis factors .

      (c) The guidance document must also either contain or be accompanied by an appropriate topic keyword and a short summary of the subject matter covered in the guidance document, for use on the guidance portal.

      (d) The regulatory office also assesses whether the guidance document constitutes significant guidance and works with the submitting office to make a good faith cost estimate, as applicable, in accordance with § 1213.8(a). If we determine that a guidance document might be significant, the regulatory office coordinates with OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), as outlined in § 1213.8(d).

      (e) We also assess whether the guidance document might be otherwise important to the agency's interests, if we reasonably anticipate that it might: Relate to a major program, policy, or activity, or a high-profile issue involving the agency or its interests; involve one of NARA's top policy priorities; garner significant press, congressional, or other attention; or raise significant questions or concerns from constituencies such as committees of Congress, states or Indian tribes, the White House or other departments of the executive branch, courts, public interest groups, or leading representatives of industry. When appropriate, we may determine that a particular guidance document that is otherwise of importance to the agency's interests be subject to the informal notice-and-comment procedures described in § 1213.8(f).

      (f) The regulatory office submits guidance documents we determine may be significant to OIRA for significance determinations, before clearing the submitting office to issue them.

      (f) When we issue a guidance document, we post it on our centralized guidance portal (see § 1213.6(a)).

      § 1213.6   Public access to guidance documents.

#### § § 1213.6

      We post the cleared document on our centralized guidance portal at  The portal contains a searchable, indexed database of our various kinds of guidance along with links to each document and an agency-unique identifier, title, date issued, z-RIN, if applicable, topic keywords, brief summary, date added to the portal, and any status information (for example, that it supersedes a previous guidance document).

      § 1213.8   Significant guidance.

#### § § 1213.8

      (a)  Even though not legally binding on the public, some agency guidance may result in a substantial economic impact on the public. For example, the guidance's existence may induce private parties to alter their conduct to conform to recommended standards or practices, thereby incurring costs beyond the costs of complying with existing statutes, regulations, and other authorities. While it may be difficult to predict with precision the economic impact of voluntary guidance on the public, we, to the extent practicable, make a good faith effort to estimate the likely economic cost impact on the public, to determine whether the document might be significant.

      (b)  When we, or OIRA, determine that a guidance document will have an economically significant impact on the public, we conduct and publish a regulatory impact analysis of the sort that would accompany an economically significant rulemaking, to the extent reasonably possible.

      (c)  Significant guidance documents do not include the categories of documents excluded by § 1213.1(b) or any other category of guidance documents the regulatory office exempts in writing in consultation with OIRA.

      (d)  If OIRA designates a guidance document as significant or economically significant, we submit it to OIRA for review under E.O. 12866 before we issue it, as with regulations; and we process significant guidance in compliance with the applicable requirements for regulations or rules, including significant regulatory actions.

      (e)  The Archivist of the United States or a senior executive designee signs or approves significant guidance.

      (f)  Except as outlined in paragraph (g) of this section, we subject all proposed guidance documents OIRA determines to be significant to the following informal notice-and-comment procedures. We publish a notice in the  announcing that a draft of the proposed guidance document is publicly available and where, either post the draft guidance document on our guidance portal or on  in a docket with the notice (depending on the nature, size, and scope of the guidance), invite public comment on the draft document for a minimum of 30 days, and prepare and post a public response to major concerns raised in the comments, as appropriate, on our guidance portal or in the docket on  (whichever location we used to post the draft guidance), either before or when we issue the guidance document.

      (g)  The requirements of paragraph (f) of this section do not apply to any significant guidance document or categories of significant guidance documents for which we find, in consultation with OIRA, good cause that notice and public comments are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and we will incorporate the finding of good cause and a brief statement of reasons in the guidance).

      § 1213.10   Petitions for guidance.

#### § § 1213.10

      (a) Any person may petition that we issue, reconsider, modify, or rescind a particular guidance document by using the procedures described here and on our guidance portal at

      (b) Submit your petition using the contact information and method noted on the guidance portal, which includes an email address or web portal for submitting electronic petitions, a mailing address for submitting hard copy petitions, and the office responsible for coordinating the request. You must submit your petition through one of these means, and the petition must:

      (c) We will review your request and make a decision whether to grant the request or deny it in whole or in part. We will provide you with a response to your request and a status update or our decision within 90 days after we receive the petition, if you provide email or mail contact information.

      § 1213.16   Exigent circumstances.

#### § § 1213.16

      In emergency situations or when we are required by statutory deadline, court order, or other exigent circumstances to act more quickly than normal review procedures allow, we notify OIRA as soon as possible and, to the extent practicable, comply with the requirements of this subpart at the earliest opportunity. Whenever practicable, we permit sufficient time to comply with the procedures in this subpart.

      § 1213.18   No judicial review or enforceable rights.

#### § § 1213.18

      We intend this part to improve our internal management. As a result, it is for the use of NARA personnel only and we do not intend it to, nor does it, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its agencies or other entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

        (4)  means the acceptance or collection of documentary materials by or on behalf of an agency or agency personnel in the course of their official duties regardless of their origin (for example, other units of their agency, private citizens, public officials, other agencies, contractors, Government grantees) and regardless of how transmitted (in person or by messenger, mail, electronic means, or by any other method). In this context, the term does not refer to misdirected materials. It may or may not refer to loaned or seized materials depending on the conditions under which such materials came into agency custody or were used by the agency. Advice of legal counsel should be sought regarding the “record” status of loaned or seized materials.

        (5)  means the filing, storing, or any other method of systematically maintaining documentary materials in any medium by the agency. This term covers materials not only actually filed or otherwise systematically maintained but also those temporarily removed from existing filing systems.

        (6)  means documentary materials made or received which, in the judgment of the agency, should be filed, stored, or otherwise systematically maintained by an agency because of the evidence of agency activities or information they contain, even if the materials are not covered by its current filing or maintenance procedures.

        § 1222.12   What types of documentary materials are Federal records?

#### § § 1222.12

        (a)  To ensure that complete and accurate records are made and retained in the Federal Government, agencies must distinguish between records and nonrecord materials by applying the definition of records (see 44 U.S.C. 3301 and 36 CFR 1220.18 and 1222.10 of this subchapter) to agency documentary materials in all formats and media.

        (b)  Documentary materials are records when they meet the conditions specified in § 1222.10(b).

        (c)  Working files, such as preliminary drafts and rough notes, and other similar materials, are records that must be maintained to ensure adequate and proper documentation if:

        (1) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, for official purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to communicate with agency staff about agency business; and

        (2) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments that adds to a proper understanding of the agency's formulation and execution of basic policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities.

        (d)  The determination as to whether a particular document is a record does not depend upon whether it contains unique information. Multiple copies of the same document and documents containing duplicative information may each have record status depending on how they are used in conducting agency business.

        § 1222.14   What are nonrecord materials?

#### § § 1222.14

        Nonrecord materials are U.S. Government-owned documentary materials that do not meet the conditions of records status (see § 1222.12(b)) or that are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of records (see 44 U.S.C. 3301). An agency's records management program also needs to include managing nonrecord materials. There are three specific categories of materials excluded from the statutory definition of records:

        (a) Library and museum material (but only if such material is made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes), including physical exhibits, artifacts, and other material objects lacking evidential value.

        (b) Extra copies of documents (but only if the sole reason such copies are preserved is for convenience of reference).

        (c) Stocks of publications and of processed documents. Catalogs, trade journals, and other publications that are received from other Government agencies, commercial firms, or private institutions and that require no action and are not part of a case on which action is taken. (Stocks do not include serial or record sets of agency publications and processed documents, including annual reports, brochures, pamphlets, books, handbooks, posters and maps.)

        § 1222.16   How are nonrecord materials managed?

#### § § 1222.16

        (a) Agencies must develop recordkeeping requirements to distinguish records from nonrecord materials.

        (b) The following guidelines should be used in managing nonrecord materials:

        (1) If a clear determination cannot be made, the materials should be treated as records. Agencies may consult with NARA for guidance.

        (2) Nonrecord materials must be physically segregated from records or, for electronic non-record materials, readily identified and segregable from records;

        (3) Nonrecord materials should be purged when no longer needed for reference. NARA's approval is not required to destroy such materials.

        § 1222.18   Under what conditions may nonrecord materials be removed from Government agencies?

#### § § 1222.18

        (a) Nonrecord materials, including extra copies of unclassified or formally declassified agency records kept only for convenience of reference, may be removed by departing employees from Government agency custody only with the approval of the head of the agency or the individual(s) authorized to act for the agency on records issues.

        (b) National security classified information may not be removed from Government custody, except for a removal of custody taken in accordance with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program established under Executive Order 12829, as amended, or a successor Order.

        (c) Information which is restricted from release under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, or other statutes may not be removed from Government custody except as permitted under those statutes.

        (d) This section does not apply to use of records and nonrecord materials in the course of conducting official agency business, including telework and authorized dissemination of information.

        § 1222.20   How are personal files defined and managed?

#### § § 1222.20

        (a) Personal files are defined in § 1220.18 of this subchapter. This section does not apply to agencies and positions that are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (44 U.S.C. 2201-2207) (see 36 CFR part 1270 of this chapter).

        (b) Personal files must be clearly designated as such and must be maintained separately from the office's official records.

        (1) Information about private (non-agency) matters and agency business must not be mixed in outgoing agency documents, such as correspondence and messages.

        (2) If information about private matters and agency business appears in a received document, the document is a Federal record. Agencies may make a copy of the document with the personal information deleted or redacted, and treat the copy as the Federal record.

        (3) Materials labeled “personal,” “confidential,” or “private,” or similarly designated, and used in the transaction of public business, are Federal records. The use of a label such as “personal” does not affect the status of documentary materials in a Federal agency.

      Subpart B—Agency Recordkeeping Requirements

        § 1222.22   What records are required to provide for adequate documentation of agency business?

#### § § 1222.22

        To meet their obligation for adequate and proper documentation, agencies must prescribe the creation and maintenance of records that:

        (a) Document the persons, places, things, or matters dealt with by the agency.

        (b) Facilitate action by agency officials and their successors in office.

        (c) Make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress or other duly authorized agencies of the Government.

        (d) Protect the financial, legal, and other rights of the Government and of persons directly affected by the Government's actions.

        (e) Document the formulation and execution of basic policies and decisions and the taking of necessary actions, including all substantive decisions and commitments reached orally (person-to-person, by telecommunications, or in conference) or electronically.

        (f) Document important board, committee, or staff meetings.

        § 1222.24   How do agencies establish recordkeeping requirements?

#### § § 1222.24

        (a) Agencies must ensure that procedures, directives and other issuances; systems planning and development documentation; and other relevant records include recordkeeping requirements for records in all media, including those records created or received on electronic mail systems. Recordkeeping requirements must:

        (1) Identify and prescribe specific categories of records to be systematically created or received and maintained by agency personnel in the course of their official duties;

        (2) Specify the use of materials and recording techniques that ensure the preservation of records as long as they are needed by the Government;

        (3) Specify the manner in which these materials must be maintained wherever held;

        (4) Propose how long records must be maintained for agency business through the scheduling process in part 1225 of this subchapter;

        (5) Distinguish records from nonrecord materials and comply with the provisions in Subchapter B concerning records scheduling and disposition;

        (6) Include procedures to ensure that departing officials and employees do not remove Federal records from agency custody and remove nonrecord materials only in accordance with § 1222.18;

        (7) Define the special recordkeeping responsibilities of program managers, information technology staff, systems administrators, and the general recordkeeping responsibilities of all agency employees.

        (b) Agencies must provide the training described in § 1220.34(f) of this subchapter and inform all employees that they are responsible and accountable for keeping accurate and complete records of their activities.

        § 1222.26   What are the general recordkeeping requirements for agencies?

#### § § 1222.26

        (a) To ensure the adequate and proper documentation of agency programs, each program must develop recordkeeping requirements that identify:

        (1) The record series and systems that must be created and maintained to document program policies, procedures, functions, activities, and transactions;

        (2) The office responsible for maintaining the record copies of those series and systems, and the applicable system administrator responsible for ensuring authenticity, protection, and ready retrieval of electronic records;

        (3) Related records series and systems;

        (4) The relationship between paper and electronic files in the same series; and

        (5) Policies, procedures, and strategies for ensuring that records are retained long enough to meet programmatic, administrative, fiscal, legal, and historical needs as authorized in a NARA-approved disposition schedule.

        (b) Agencies must capture, manage, and preserve electronic records with appropriate metadata and must be able to access and retrieve electronic records, including electronic messages, through electronic searches.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 87 FR 75931, Dec. 12, 2022]

        § 1222.28   What are the series level recordkeeping requirements?

#### § § 1222.28

        To ensure that record series and systems adequately document agency policies, transactions, and activities, each program must develop recordkeeping requirements for records series and systems that include:

        (a) Identification of information and documentation that must be included in the series and/or system;

        (b) Arrangement of each series and the records within the series and/or system;

        (c) Identification of the location of the records and the staff responsible for maintaining the records;

        (d) Policies and procedures for maintaining the documentation of phone calls, meetings, instant messages, and electronic mail exchanges that include substantive information about agency policies and activities;

        (e) Policies and procedures for identifying working files and for determining the record status of working files in paper and electronic form; and

        (f) Policies and procedures for maintaining series consisting of different media.

        § 1222.30   When must agencies comply with the recordkeeping requirements of other agencies?

#### § § 1222.30

        Agencies must comply with recordkeeping requirements that are imposed government-wide by another agency with jurisdiction over the program or activity being conducted, e.g., requirements for records concerning hazardous waste. Affected agencies must include these requirements in appropriate directives or other official issuances prescribing the agency's organization, functions, or activities.

        § 1222.32   How do agencies manage records created or received by contractors?

#### § § 1222.32

        (a) Agency officials responsible for administering contracts must safeguard records created, processed, or in the possession of a contractor or a non-Federal entity by taking the following steps:

        (1) Agencies must ensure that contractors performing Federal government agency functions create and maintain records that document these activities. Agencies must specify in the contract Government ownership and the delivery to the Government of all records necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of contractor-operated agency activities and programs in accordance with requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-400), as amended by Pub. L. 96-83 41 U.S.C.), and, where applicable, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (48 CFR parts 200-299).

        (2) Records management oversight of contract records is necessary to ensure that all recordkeeping needs are met. All records created for Government use and delivered to, or under the legal control of, the Government must be managed in accordance with Federal law. In addition, electronic records and background electronic data specified for delivery to the contracting agency must be accompanied by sufficient technical documentation to permit understanding and use of the records and data.

        (3) Contracts that require the creation of data for the Government's use must specify, in addition to the final product, delivery of background supporting data or other records that may have reuse value to the Government. To determine what background supporting data or other records that contractors must deliver, program and contracting officials must consult with agency records and information managers and historians and, when appropriate, with other Government agencies to ensure that all Government needs are met, especially when the data deliverables support a new agency mission or a new Government program.

        (4) Deferred ordering and delivery-of-data clauses and rights-in-data clauses must be included in contracts whenever necessary to ensure adequate and proper documentation or because the data have reuse value to the Government.

        (b) All data created for Government use and delivered to, or falling under the legal control of, the Government are Federal records subject to the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapters 21, 29, 31, and 33, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended, and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, and must be managed and scheduled for disposition only as provided in Subchapter B.

        (c) Agencies must ensure that appropriate authority for retention of classified materials has been granted to contractors or non-Government entities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), established under Executive order 12829, as amended, or a successor Order.

        § 1222.34   How must agencies maintain records?

#### § § 1222.34

        Agencies must implement a records maintenance program so that complete records are filed or otherwise identified and preserved, records can be readily found when needed, and permanent and temporary records are physically segregated from each other or, for electronic records, segregable. Agency records maintenance programs must:

        (a) Institute procedures for organizing and storing records;

        (b) Maintain electronic, audiovisual and cartographic, and microform records in accordance with 36 CFR parts 1236, 1237, and 1238 of this subchapter, respectively;

        (c) Assign responsibilities for maintenance of records in all formats within each agency component, including designation of the officials that are responsible for maintenance and disposition of electronic records and management of automated systems used for recordkeeping;

        (d) Institute reference and retrieval procedures and controls that:

        (1) Facilitate the finding, charging out, and refiling of records, including safeguards against loss during transit; and

        (2) Ensure that access to electronic records minimizes the risk of unauthorized additions, deletions, or alterations;

        (e) Issue appropriate instructions to all agency employees on handling and protecting records;

        (f) Maintain records and nonrecord materials separately, in accordance with § 1222.16;

        (g) Maintain personal files separately from records in accordance with § 1222.20; and

        (h) Comply with 36 CFR parts 1232 and 1234 of this subchapter when storing records in a records facility.

These authorities require the head of each agency to make and preserve records that contain adequate and proper documentation of the organization and to perform national security emergency preparedness functions.

      (b) These regulations are in conformance with guidance provided in Federal Continuity Directive (FCD) 1, Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program and Requirements, and FCD 2, Federal Executive Branch Mission Essential Function and Primary Mission Essential Function Identification and Submission Process.

      § 1223.2   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 1223.2

      (a) See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1223.

      (b) As used in part 1223—

      means the periodic removal of obsolete copies of vital records and their replacement with copies of current vital records. This may occur daily, weekly, quarterly, annually or at other designated intervals.

      means an unexpected occurrence inflicting widespread destruction and distress and having long-term adverse effects on agency operations. Each agency defines what a long-term adverse effect is in relation to its most critical program activities.

      means a situation or an occurrence of a serious nature, developing suddenly and unexpectedly, and demanding immediate action. This is generally of short duration, for example, an interruption of normal agency operations for a week or less. It may involve electrical failure or minor flooding caused by broken pipes.

      are those types of vital records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of an organization during and after an emergency. Included are emergency plans and directive(s), orders of succession, delegations of authority, staffing assignments, selected program records needed to continue the most critical agency operations, as well as related policy or procedural records that assist agency staff in conducting operations under emergency conditions and for resuming normal operations after an emergency.

      are that type of vital records essential to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of the individuals directly affected by its activities. Examples include accounts receivable records, social security records, payroll records, retirement records, and insurance records. These records were formerly defined as “rights-and-interests” records.

      means any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States, as defined in Executive Order 12656.

      means a facility other than an agency's normal place of business where records are kept until eligible for final disposition. Vital records may be kept at off-site storage to ensure that they are not damaged or destroyed should an emergency occur in an agency's normal place of business.

      means essential agency records that are needed to meet operational responsibilities under national security emergencies or other emergency conditions (emergency operating records) or to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and those affected by Government activities (legal and financial rights records).

      means the policies, plans, and procedures developed and implemented and the resources needed to identify, use, and protect the essential records needed to meet operational responsibilities under national security emergencies or other emergency conditions or to protect the Government's rights or those of its citizens. This is a program element of an agency's emergency management function.

      § 1223.3   What standards are used as guidance for Part 1223?

> [83 FR 13653, Mar. 30, 2018]

      § 1223.10   What is the purpose of Part 1223?

#### § § 1223.10

      Part 1223 specifies policies and procedures needed to establish a program to identify, protect, and manage vital records as part of an agency's continuity of operation plan designed to meet emergency management responsibilities.

      § 1223.12   What are the objectives of a vital records program?

#### § § 1223.12

      A vital records program has two objectives:

      (a) It provides an agency with the information it needs to conduct its business under other than normal operating conditions and to resume normal business afterward; and

      (b) It enables agency officials to identify and protect the most important records dealing with the legal and financial rights of the agency and of persons directly affected by the agency's actions.

      § 1223.14   What elements must a vital records program include?

#### § § 1223.14

      To achieve compliance with this section, an agency's vital records program must contain all elements listed in FCD 1, Annex I (incorporated by reference, see § 1223.4). In carrying out a vital records program, agencies must:

      (a) Specify agency staff responsibilities;

      (b) Appropriately inform all staff about vital records;

      (c) Ensure that the designation of vital records is current and complete; and

      (d) Ensure that vital records are adequately protected, accessible, and immediately usable.

      § 1223.16   How are vital records identified?

#### § § 1223.16

      Agencies identify vital records in the context of the emergency management function. Vital records are those that are needed to perform the most critical functions of the agency and those needed to protect legal and financial rights of the Government and of the persons affected by its actions. Vital records also include emergency plans and related records that specify how an agency will respond to an emergency. The informational content of records series and electronic records systems determines which are vital records. Only the most recent and complete sources of the information are vital records.

      § 1223.18   Must vital records be in a particular form or format?

#### § § 1223.18

      (a) Vital records can be original records or copies of records. Consult NARA records management guidance on vital records at  for further information.

      (b) Records may be maintained on a variety of media including paper, magnetic tape, optical disk, photographic film, and microform. In selecting the media, agencies must ensure that equipment needed to read the specific media will be available following an emergency or disaster.

      § 1223.20   What are the requirements for accessing vital records during an emergency?

#### § § 1223.20

      Agencies must establish retrieval procedures for vital records that are easily implemented, especially since individuals unfamiliar with the records may need to use them in an emergency. For electronic records systems, agencies must also ensure that appropriate hardware, software, and system documentation adequate to operate the system and access the records will be available in case of an emergency.

      § 1223.22   How must agencies protect vital records?

#### § § 1223.22

      Agencies must take appropriate measures to ensure the survival of the vital records or copies of vital records in case of an emergency.

      (a)  Agencies may choose to duplicate vital records as the primary protection method. Duplication can be to the same medium as the original record or to a different medium. When agencies choose duplication as a protection method, the copy of the vital record stored off-site is normally a duplicate of the original record. The agency may store the original records off-site if their protection is necessary, or if it does not need to keep the original records at its normal place of business.

      (b)  Once records are duplicated, they must be dispersed to sites a sufficient distance away to avoid being subject to the same emergency. Dispersal sites may be other office locations of the same agency or some other site.

      (c)  Copies of emergency operating vital records must be accessible in a very short period of time for use in the event of an emergency. Copies of legal and financial rights records may not be needed as quickly. In deciding where to store vital record copies, agencies must treat records that have the properties of both categories, that is, emergency operating and legal and financial rights records, as emergency operating records.

      (1) The off-site copy of legal and financial rights vital records may be stored at an off-site agency location or, in accordance with § 1233.12 of this subchapter, at a records storage facility.

      (2) When using a NARA records storage facility for storing vital records that are duplicate copies of original records, the agency must specify on the SF 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, that they are vital records (duplicate copies) and the medium on which they are maintained. The agency must also periodically cycle (update) them by removing obsolete items and replacing them with the most recent version.

      § 1223.24   When can vital records be destroyed?

#### § § 1223.24

      The disposition of vital records that are original records is governed by records schedules approved by NARA (see part 1225, Scheduling Records, of this subchapter). Agencies must not destroy original records that are not scheduled. Duplicate copies created and maintained for vital records purposes only may be destroyed when superseded or obsolete during the routine vital records cycle process.

      (c) Regularly review agency-generated schedules, and, if necessary, update them. Every five years, agencies must review all records schedules that are ten years old and older, based on the date NARA approved the schedule, and in accordance with § 1225.22(a) of this subchapter.

      (d) Incorporate records retention and disposition functionality during the design, development, and implementation of new or revised recordkeeping systems (whether paper or electronic). See § 1236.6 of this subchapter.

      (e) Provide training and guidance to all employees on agency records disposition requirements and procedures and other significant aspects of the records disposition program. When a new or revised records schedule is issued, provide specific guidance to employees responsible for applying the schedule.

### Part 1225

**Authority:** Authority: 44 U.S.C. 2111, 2904, 2905, 3102, and Chapter 33.

**Source:** Source: 74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1225.1   What are the authorities for this part?

#### § § 1225.1

      The statutory authorities for this part are 44 U.S.C. 2111, 2904, 2905, 3102, and Chapter 33.

      § 1225.2   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 1225.2

      See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1225.

      § 1225.3   What standards are used as guidance for this part?

#### § § 1225.3

      These regulations conform with guidance provided in ISO 15489-1:2001, Information and documentation—Records management. Paragraphs 4 (Benefits of records management), 6.3 (Responsibilities), 7.1 (Principles of records management programmes), 8.3.7 (Retention and disposition), 9.2 (Determining how long to retain records), 9.10 (Documenting records management processes), 10 (Records management processes and controls), and 11 (Monitoring and auditing) apply to records scheduling.

      § 1225.10   What Federal records must be scheduled?

#### § § 1225.10

      All Federal records, including those created or maintained for the Government by a contractor, must be covered by a NARA-approved agency disposition authority, SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, or the NARA General Records Schedules.

      § 1225.12   How are records schedules developed?

#### § § 1225.12

      The principal steps in developing agency records schedules are listed below. Additional details that may be helpful are provided in the NARA records management handbook,  at

      (a) Conduct a functional or work process analysis to identify the functions or activities performed by each organization or unit. Identify the recordkeeping requirements for each.

      (b) Prepare an inventory for each function or activity to identify records series, systems, and nonrecord materials.

      (c) Determine the appropriate scope of the records schedule items, e.g., individual series/system component, work process, group of related work processes, or broad program area.

      (d) Evaluate the period of time the agency needs each records series or system based on use, value to agency operations and oversight agencies, and legal obligations. Determine whether a fixed or flexible retention period is more appropriate. For records proposed as temporary, specify a retention period that meets agency business needs and legal requirements. For records proposed as permanent records, identify how long the records are needed by the agency before they are transferred to NARA.

      (e) Determine whether the proposed disposition should be limited to records in a specific medium. Records schedules submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, are media neutral, , the disposition instructions apply to the described records in any medium, unless the schedule identifies a specific medium for a specific series.

      (f) Compile a schedule for records, including descriptions and disposition instructions for each item, using an SF 115.

      (g) Obtain internal clearances, as appropriate, from program offices and other stakeholders such as the legal counsel, chief information officer, electronic systems manager, and agency historian, as appropriate.

      (h) Obtain approval from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), when required (see § 1225.20(a) for the categories that require GAO approval).

      (i) Submit an SF 115 covering only new or revised record items to NARA for approval (see § 1225.18(d)).

      (j) The disposition instructions on SF 115s approved by the Archivist of the United States are mandatory (44 U.S.C. 3314).

      § 1225.14   How do agencies schedule permanent records?

#### § § 1225.14

      (a)  Identify potentially permanent records. Useful guidelines in the identification of permanent Federal records may be found in the NARA records management handbook,  (see § 1225.12 for the Web site address of this publication).

      (b)  Each item proposed for permanent retention on an SF 115 must include the following:

      (1) Descriptive title of the records series, component of an information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or information system components. The descriptive title must be meaningful to agency personnel;

      (2) Complete description of the records including:

      (i) Agency function;

      (ii) Physical type, if appropriate;

      (iii) Inclusive dates;

      (iv) Statement of how records are arranged;

      (v) Statement of restrictions on access under the FOIA if the records are proposed for immediate transfer;

      (3) Disposition instructions developed using the following guidelines:

      (i) If the records series or system is current and continuing, the SF 115 must specify the period of time after which the records will be transferred to the National Archives of the United States, and if appropriate, the time period for returning inactive records to an approved records storage facility.

      (ii) If the records series or system is nonrecurring, i.e., no additional records will be created or acquired, the agency must propose either that the records be transferred to the National Archives of the United States immediately or set transfer for a fixed date in the future.

      (c)  NARA will appraise the records to determine if they have sufficient value to warrant archival permanent preservation. If NARA determines either that records are not permanent or that the transfer instructions are not appropriate:

      (1) NARA will notify the agency and negotiate an appropriate disposition. The disposition instruction on the SF 115 will be modified prior to NARA approval; or

      (2) If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the disposition instruction for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a new schedule is approved.

      § 1225.16   How do agencies schedule temporary records?

#### § § 1225.16

      (a)  Federal agencies request authority to dispose of records, either immediately or on a recurring basis. Requests for immediate disposal are limited to existing records that no longer accumulate. For recurring records, approved schedules provide continuing authority to destroy the records. The retention periods approved by NARA are mandatory, and the agency must dispose of the records after expiration of the retention period, except as provided in §§ 1226.18 and 1226.20 of this subchapter.

      (b)  Each item on an SF 115 proposed for eventual destruction must include the following:

      (1) Descriptive title familiar to agency personnel;

      (2) Description of the records including agency function, physical type(s) and informational content;

      (3) Disposition instructions developed using the following guidelines:

      (i) If the record series, component of an electronic information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or automated system components is current and continuing, the SF 115 must include file breaks, retention period or event after which the records will be destroyed, and, if appropriate, transfer period for retiring inactive records to an approved records storage facility.

      (ii) If the records series, system, or other aggregation is nonrecurring,  no additional records will be created or acquired, the SF 115 must specify either immediate destruction or destruction on a future date.

      (c)  If NARA determines that the proposed disposition is not consistent with the value of the records, it will request that the agency make appropriate changes.

      (1) If NARA determines that records proposed as temporary merit permanent retention and transfer to the National Archives of the United States, the agency must change the disposition instruction prior to approval of the SF 115.

      (2) If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the retention period for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a new schedule is approved.

      § 1225.18   How do agencies request records disposition authority?

#### § § 1225.18

      (a) Federal agencies submit an SF 115 to NARA to request authority to schedule (establish the disposition for) permanent and temporary records, either on a recurring or one-time basis.

      (b) SF 115s include only records not covered by the General Records Schedules (GRS) (see part 1227 of this subchapter), deviations from the GRS (see § 1227.12 of this subchapter), or previously scheduled records requiring changes in retention periods or substantive changes in description.

      (c) SF 115s do not include nonrecord material. The disposition of nonrecord materials is determined by agencies and does not require NARA approval.

      (d) The following elements are required on a SF 115:

      (1) Title and description of the records covered by each item.

      (2) Disposition instructions that can be readily applied. Records schedules must provide for:

      (i) The destruction of records that no longer have sufficient value to justify further retention (see § 1224.10(b) of this subchapter); and

      (ii) The identification of potentially permanent records and provisions for their transfer to the legal custody of NARA.

      (3) Certification that the records proposed for disposition are not now needed for the business of the agency or will not be needed after the specified retention periods. The signature of the authorized agency representative on the SF 115 provides certification.

      (e) NARA will return SF 115s that are improperly prepared. The agency must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the form to NARA.

      § 1225.20   When do agencies have to get GAO approval for schedules?

#### § § 1225.20

      (a) If an agency requests a deviation from the GRS related to accountable officer records that would authorize a retention period shorter than the retention period provided in the GRS, the agency must obtain approval from the Comptroller General.

      (b) This approval must be obtained before NARA will approve the proposed agency records schedule.

> [89 FR 35008, May 1, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 47468, June 3, 2024]

      § 1225.22   When must agencies reschedule or review their records schedules?

#### § § 1225.22

      (a) Every five years, agencies must review all records schedules that are ten years old and older, based on the date that NARA approved the schedule. Agencies may also review their agency records schedules on a more frequent regular basis to determine if they remain accurate.

      (b) Agencies must submit a new records schedule to NARA in the following situations:

      (1) If an interagency reorganization reassigns functions to an existing department or agency, the gaining organization must submit a new records schedule to NARA within one year of the reorganization. Schedules approved for one department or independent agency do not apply to the records of other departments or agencies.

      (2) If a new department or agency assumes functions from an existing one, the new agency must schedule records documenting the acquired functions and all other records not covered by the GRS within two years.

      (3) If an agency needs to deviate from retention periods in the GRS.

      (4) If an agency needs to change retention periods for records previously appraised as temporary by NARA.

      (5) If an agency needs to change the approved disposition of records from permanent to temporary or vice versa.

      (6) If an agency needs to modify the description of records because the informational content of the records and/or the function documented by the records changes.

      (7) If an agency decides to change the scope of the records schedule items to include a greater or lesser aggregation of records (see § 1225.12(c)), unless § 1225.24 applies.

      (8) Agencies must submit a new schedule to NARA for electronic versions of previously scheduled records if:

      (i) The content and function of the records have changed significantly (e.g., the electronic records contain information that is substantially different from the information included in the hard copy series or are used for different purposes).

      (ii) The previously approved schedule explicitly excludes electronic records.

      (iii) The electronic records consist of program records maintained on an agency Web site.

      (iv) The electronic records consist of temporary program records maintained in a format other than scanned image AND the previously approved schedule is not media neutral.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 88 FR 28416, May 4, 2023]

      § 1225.24   When can an agency apply previously approved schedules to electronic records?

#### § § 1225.24

      If the conditions specified in § 1225.22(h) do not apply, the following conditions apply:

      (a)  (1) The agency may apply a previously approved schedule for hard copy records to electronic versions of the permanent records when the electronic records system replaces a single series of hard copy permanent records or the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple previously scheduled permanent series. Agencies must notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at , in writing of series of records that have been previously scheduled as permanent in hard copy form, including special media records as described in 36 CFR 1235.52 of this subchapter. An agency should send the notification to the NARA unit that processes its schedules. The notification must be submitted within 90 days of when the electronic recordkeeping system becomes operational and must contain the:

      (i) Name of agency;

      (ii) Name of the electronic system;

      (iii) Organizational unit(s) or agency program that records support;

      (iv) Current disposition authority reference; and

      (v) Format of the records (e.g., database, scanned images, digital photographs, ).

      (2) If the electronic records include information drawn from both temporary and permanent hard copy series, an agency either may apply a previously approved permanent disposition authority, after submitting the notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section or may submit a new schedule if the agency believes the electronic records do not warrant permanent retention.

      (b)  The agency must apply the previously approved schedule to digital versions. If changes in the approved schedule are required, follow § 1225.26.

      (c)  The agency must apply the previously approved schedule. If changes in the approved schedule are required, follow § 1225.26.

      (d)  (1) For temporary records that are covered by an item in a General Records Schedule (other than those General Records Schedule items that exclude electronic master files and databases) or an agency-specific schedule that pertains to administrative housekeeping activities, apply the previously approved schedule. If the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple hard copy series, apply the previously approved schedule item with the longest retention period.

      (2) For temporary program records covered by a NARA-approved media neutral schedule item (, the item appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval before December 17, 2007, that is explicitly stated to be media neutral, or it appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, that is not explicitly limited to a specific recordkeeping medium), apply the previously approved schedule.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13653, Mar. 30, 2018]

      § 1225.26   How do agencies change a disposition authority?

#### § § 1225.26

      Agencies must submit an SF 115 to permanently change the approved disposition of records. Disposition authorities are automatically superseded by approval of a later SF 115 for the same records unless the later SF 115 specifies an effective date. As provided in § 1226.20(c) of this subchapter, agencies are authorized to retain records eligible for destruction until the new schedule is approved.

      (a) SF 115s that revise previously approved disposition authorities must cite all of the following, if applicable:

      (1) The SF 115 and item numbers to be superseded;

      (2) The General Records Schedules and item numbers that cover the records, if any; and

      (3) The current published records disposition manual and item numbers; or the General Records Schedules and item numbers that cover the records.

      (b) Agencies must submit with the SF 115 an explanation and justification for the change.

      (c) For temporary retention of records beyond their normal retention period, see § 1226.18 of this subchapter.

      (d) Agencies must secure NARA approval of a change in the period of time that permanent records will remain in agency legal custody prior to transfer to the National Archives of the United States. To request approval, agencies send written requests to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  NARA approval is documented as an annotation to the schedule item. A new SF 115 is not required to extend the time period of agency legal custody.

#### § § 1226.1

      The statutory authorities are 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2904, 3102, 3301 and 3302.

      § 1226.2   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 1226.2

      See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1226.

      § 1226.3   What standards are used as guidance for this part?

#### § § 1226.3

      These regulations conform with guidance in ISO 15489-1:2001, Information and documentation—Records management, sections 8.3.7 (Retention and disposition), 8.5 (Discontinuing records systems), 9.2 (Determining how long to retain records), and 9.9 (Implementing disposition).

      § 1226.10   Must agencies apply approved schedules to their records?

#### § § 1226.10

      The application of approved schedules is mandatory except as provided in §§ 1226.16 and 1226.18. Federal records must be retained as specified in the schedule to conduct Government business, protect rights, avoid waste, and preserve permanent records for transfer to the National Archives of the United States.

      § 1226.12   How do agencies disseminate approved schedules?

#### § § 1226.12

      (a) Agencies must issue disposition authorities through their internal directives system within six months of approval of the SF 115 or GRS to ensure proper distribution and application of the schedule. The directive must cite the legal authority (GRS or SF 115 and item numbers) for each schedule item covering records.

      (b) Agencies must send, via link or file, an electronic copy of each published agency schedule, directive, and other policy issuance relating to records disposition to NARA at  when the directive, manual, or policy issuance is posted or distributed.

      (c) The submission must include the name, title, agency, address, and phone number of the submitter. If the comprehensive records schedule or other policy issuance is posted on a publicly available Web site, the agency must provide the full Internet address (URL).

      § 1226.14   What are the limitations in applying approved records schedules?

#### § § 1226.14

      Agencies must apply the approved records disposition schedules to their agency's records as follows

      (a) Records described by items marked “disposition not approved” or “withdrawn” may not be destroyed until a specific disposition has been approved by NARA.

      (b) Disposition authorities for items on approved SF 115s that specify an organizational component of the department or independent agency as the creator or custodian of the records may be applied to the same records after internal reorganization, but only if the nature, content, and functional importance of the records remain the same. Authority approved for items described in a functional format may be applied to any organizational component within the department or independent agency that is responsible for the relevant function.

      (c) Disposition authorities approved for one department or independent agency may not be applied to records of another department or agency. Departments or agencies that acquire records from another department or agency, and/or continue creating the same series of records previously created by another department or agency through interagency reorganization must promptly submit an SF 115 to NARA for disposition authorization. Until the new records schedule is approved, the records are unscheduled. See § 1225.22 of this subchapter.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, newly approved disposition authorities apply retroactively to all existing records as described in the schedule.

      (e) When required by court order (, order for expungement or destruction), an agency may destroy temporary records before their NARA-authorized disposition date. In accordance with § 1230.14 of this subchapter, an agency must notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  when permanent or unscheduled records are to be destroyed in response to a court order. If the records have significant historical value, NARA will promptly advise the agency of any concerns over their destruction.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13653, Mar. 30, 2018]

      § 1226.16   Does NARA ever withdraw disposition authority?

#### § § 1226.16

      (a) When required to ensure the preservation of Government records, or when required by an emergency, or to maintain efficiency of Government operations, NARA will withdraw disposal authorizations in approved schedules (44 U.S.C. 2909). This withdrawal may apply to particular items on agency schedules or may apply to all existing authorizations for a specified type of record in any or all agencies.

      (b) To both impose and rescind the withdrawal, NARA will notify the affected agency or agencies in writing, either by letter or NARA bulletin.

      § 1226.18   When may agencies temporarily extend retention periods?

#### § § 1226.18

      (a) Agencies may temporarily retain records approved for destruction beyond their NARA-approved retention period if special circumstances alter the normal administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records.

      (1) Agencies must not retain records whose disposal after a specified period is required by statute, unless retention is ordered by a Court.

      (2) In determining whether or not to temporarily extend the retention period of records, agencies must ensure that the extension of retention is consistent with the requirement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a (Privacy Act of 1974, as amended) that records concerning individuals are maintained only if relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency that is required by law or Executive order.

      (b) If the records that are to be temporarily retained beyond their approved destruction date have been transferred to records storage facilities, agencies must notify the facility.

      (c) Once the special circumstances that require extended retention of records have elapsed, agencies must destroy the records in accordance with the NARA-approved disposition instructions.

      (d) Agencies must submit an SF 115 to NARA to change schedule provisions on a continuing basis in accordance with § 1225.26 of this subchapter. Agencies may retain records eligible for destruction until the new schedule is approved.

      § 1226.20   How do agencies temporarily extend retention periods?

#### § § 1226.20

      (a) Agencies must secure NARA written approval to retain records series or systems that are eligible for destruction under NARA-approved schedules except when:

      (1) The agency has requested a change in the records schedule in accordance with § 1225.26 of this subchapter, in which case the agency is authorized to retain records eligible for destruction until the new SF 115 is approved;

      (2) The records will be needed for less than one year; or

      (3) A court order requires retention of the records.

      (b) To request an extension, agencies must send a letter to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  Along with a justification, the request must include:

      (1) A concise description of the records series for which the extension is requested.

      (2) A citation to the agency records schedule or the GRS currently governing disposition of the records;

      (3) A statement of the estimated period of time that the records will be required; and

      (4) For records in the agency's custody, a statement of the current and proposed physical location of the records.

      (c) Agencies must ensure that records in records storage facilities are retained for the duration of the extension.

      § 1226.22   When must agencies transfer permanent records?

#### § § 1226.22

      All records scheduled as permanent must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States after the period specified on the SF 115 in accordance with procedures specified under § 1235.12 of this subchapter.

      § 1226.24   How must agencies destroy temporary records?

#### § § 1226.24

      (a) —(1)  Paper records to be destroyed normally must be sold as wastepaper, or otherwise salvaged. All sales must follow the established procedures for the sale of surplus personal property. (See 41 CFR part 101—45, Sale, Abandonment, or Destruction of Personal Property.) The contract for sale must prohibit the resale of all records for use as records or documents.

      (2)  Records other than paper records (audio, visual, and electronic records on physical media data tapes, disks, and diskettes) may be salvaged and sold in the same manner and under the same conditions as paper records.

      (b)  Unrestricted records that agencies cannot sell or otherwise salvage must be destroyed by burning, pulping, shredding, macerating, or other suitable means authorized by implementing regulations issued under E.O. 12958, as amended or its successor.

      (c)  If the records are restricted because they are national security classified or exempted from disclosure by statute, including the Privacy Act, or regulation:

      (1)  For paper records, the agency or its wastepaper contractor must definitively destroy the information contained in the records by one of the means specified in paragraph (b) of this section and their destruction must be witnessed either by a Federal employee or, if authorized by the agency, by a contractor employee.

      (2)  Electronic records scheduled for destruction must be disposed of in a manner that ensures protection of any sensitive, proprietary, or national security information. Magnetic recording media previously used for electronic records containing sensitive, proprietary, or national security information must not be reused if the previously recorded information can be compromised in any way by reuse of the media.

      § 1226.26   How do agencies donate temporary records?

#### § § 1226.26

      (a) Agencies must obtain written approval from NARA before donating records eligible for disposal to an appropriate person, organization, institution, corporation, or government (including a foreign government) that has requested them. Records that are not eligible for disposal cannot be donated.

      (b) Agencies request the approval of such a donation by sending a letter to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  The request must include:

      (1) The name of the department or agency, and relevant subdivisions, having custody of the records;

      (2) The name and address of the proposed recipient of the records;

      (3) A list containing:

      (i) Description of the records to be transferred,

      (ii) The inclusive dates of the records,

      (4) A statement of the purpose and duration of the loan;

      (5) A statement specifying any restrictions on the use of the records and how these restrictions will be imposed by the recipient;

      (6) A certification that the records will be stored in areas with security and environmental controls equal to those specified in part 1234 of this subchapter; and

      (7) A signature block for the Archivist of the United States. The loan must not take place until the Archivist has signed the agreement.

      (b) On request, NARA may allow an agency to prepare an annual loan agreement covering multiple transfers from the same series of records to another single Federal agency.

      (c) The agency must send a written request to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  transmitting the proposed loan agreement, citing the rationale for not providing copies in place of the original records, and specifying the name, title, and phone number of an agency contact.

      (b) NARA will deny the request within 30 days if the records are due or past due to be transferred to the National Archives of the United States in accordance with part 1235 of this subchapter, if the loan would endanger the records, or if the loan would otherwise violate the regulations in 36 CFR chapter XII, subchapter B. NARA will notify the agency in writing if it disapproves the loan and the reasons for the disapproval of the loan.

      § 1228.16   When must agencies retrieve records that have been loaned?

#### § § 1228.16

      An agency must contact the recipient of loaned permanent or unscheduled records 30 days prior to the expiration of the loan period (as stated in the loan agreement) to arrange for the return of the records. If the agency extends the duration of the loan, it must notify NARA (see § 1228.12(b)) in writing, specifying the reason for the extension and providing the new expiration date of the loan.

      Subpart B—Facility Standards

        § 1234.10   What are the facility requirements for all records storage facilities?

#### § § 1234.10

        (a) The facility must be constructed with non-combustible materials and building elements, including walls, columns and floors. There are two exceptions to this requirement:

        (1) Roof elements may be constructed with combustible materials if installed in accordance with local building codes and if roof elements are protected by a properly installed, properly maintained wet-pipe automatic sprinkler system, as specified in NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (2) An agency may request a waiver of the requirement specified in paragraph (a) from NARA for an existing records storage facility with combustible building elements to continue to operate until October 1, 2009. In its request for a waiver, the agency must provide documentation that the facility has a fire suppression system specifically designed to mitigate this hazard and that the system meets the requirements of § 1234.12(s). Submit waiver requests to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.

        (b) A facility with two or more stories must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer and civil/structural engineer to avoid catastrophic failure of the structure due to an uncontrolled fire on one of the intermediate floor levels. For new buildings the seals on the construction drawings serve as proof of this review. For existing buildings, this requirement may be demonstrated by a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed fire protection engineer that the fire resistance of the separating floor(s) is/(are) at least four hours, and a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed civil/structural engineer that there are no obvious structural weaknesses that would indicate a high potential for structural catastrophic collapse under fire conditions.

        (c) The building must be sited a minimum of five feet above and 100 feet from any 100 year flood plain areas, or be protected by an appropriate flood wall that conforms to local or regional building codes.

        (d) The facility must be designed in accordance with the applicable national, regional, state, or local building codes (whichever is most stringent) to provide protection from building collapse or failure of essential equipment from earthquake hazards, tornadoes, hurricanes and other potential natural disasters.

        (e) Roads, fire lanes and parking areas must permit unrestricted access for emergency vehicles.

        (f) A floor load limit must be established for the records storage area by a licensed structural engineer. The limit must take into consideration the height and type of the shelving or storage equipment, the width of the aisles, the configuration of the space, etc. The allowable load limit must be posted in a conspicuous place and must not be exceeded.

        (g) The facility must ensure that the roof membrane does not permit water to penetrate the roof. NARA strongly recommends that this requirement be met by not mounting equipment on the roof and placing nothing else on the roof that may cause damage to the roof membrane. Alternatively, a facility may meet this requirement with stringent design specifications for roof-mounted equipment in conjunction with a periodic roof inspection program performed by appropriately certified professionals.

        (1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) beginning on September 28, 2005.

        (2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) no later than October 1, 2009.

        (h) Piping (with the exception of fire protection sprinkler piping and storm water roof drainage piping) must not be run through records storage areas unless supplemental measures such as gutters or shields are used to prevent water leaks and the piping assembly is inspected for potential leaks regularly. If drainage piping from roof drains must be run though records storage areas, the piping must be run to the nearest vertical riser and must include a continuous gutter sized and installed beneath the lateral runs to prevent leakage into the storage area. Vertical pipe risers required to be installed in records storage areas must be fully enclosed by shaft construction with appropriate maintenance access panels.

        (1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) beginning on September 28, 2005.

        (2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) no later than October 1, 2009.

        (i) The following standards apply to records storage shelving and racking systems:

        (1) All storage shelving and racking systems must be designed and installed to provide seismic bracing that meets the requirements of the applicable state, regional, and local building code (whichever is most stringent);

        (2) Racking systems, steel shelving, or other open-shelf records storage equipment must be braced to prevent collapse under full load. Each racking system or shelving unit must be industrial style shelving rated at least 50 pounds per cubic foot supported by the shelf;

        (3) Compact mobile shelving systems (if used) must be designed to permit proper air circulation and fire protection. Request detailed specifications that meet this requirement from NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.

        (j) The area occupied by the records storage facility must be equipped with an anti-intrusion alarm system, or equivalent, meeting the requirements of UL 1076 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), level AA, to protect against unlawful entry after hours and to monitor designated interior storage spaces. This intrusion alarm system must be monitored in accordance with UL 611, (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (k) The facility must comply with the requirements for a Level III facility as defined in the Department of Justice, U. S. Marshals Service report Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities dated June 28, 1995. These requirements are provided in Appendix A to this part 1234. Agencies may require compliance with Level IV or Level V facility security requirements if the facility is classified at the higher level.

        (l) Records contaminated by hazardous materials, such as radioactive isotopes or toxins, infiltrated by insects, or exhibiting active mold growth must be stored in separate areas having separate air handling systems from other records.

        (m) To eliminate damage to records and/or loss of information due to insects, rodents, mold and other pests that are attracted to organic materials under specific environmental conditions, the facility must have an Integrated Pest Management program as defined in the Food Protection Act of 1996 (Section 303, Pub. L. 104-170, 110 Stat. 1512). This states in part that Integrated Pest Management is a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks. The IPM program emphasizes three fundamental elements:

        (1)  IPM is a preventive maintenance process that seeks to identify and eliminate potential pest access, shelter, and nourishment. It also continually monitors for pests themselves, so that small infestations do not become large ones;

        (2)  IPM aims to minimize both pesticide use and risk through alternate control techniques and by favoring compounds, formulations, and application methods that present the lowest potential hazard to humans and the environment; and

        (3)  The IPM pest control contract must be effectively coordinated with all other relevant programs that operate in and around a building, including plans and procedures involving design and construction, repairs and alterations, cleaning, waste management, food service, and other activities.

        (n) For new records storage facilities only, the additional requirements in this paragraph (n) must be met:

        (1) Do not install mechanical equipment, excluding material handling and conveyance equipment that have operating thermal breakers on the motor, containing motors rated in excess of 1 HP within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).

        (2) Do not install high-voltage electrical distribution equipment ( 13.2kv or higher switchgear and transformers) within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).

        (3) A redundant source of primary electric service such as a second primary service feeder should be provided to ensure continuous, dependable service to the facility especially to the HVAC systems, fire alarm and fire protection systems. Manual switching between sources of service is acceptable.

        (4) A facility storing permanent records must be kept under positive air pressure, especially in the area of the loading dock. In addition, to prevent fumes from vehicle exhausts from entering the facility, air intake louvers must not be located in the area of the loading dock, adjacent to parking areas, or in any location where a vehicle engine may be running for any period of time. Loading docks must have an air supply and exhaust system that is separate from the remainder of the facility.

        § 1234.12   What are the fire safety requirements that apply to records storage facilities?

#### § § 1234.12

        (a) The fire detection and protection systems must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer. If the system was not designed by a licensed fire protection engineer, the review requirement is met by furnishing a report under the seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that describes the design intent of the fire detection and suppression system, detailing the characteristics of the system, and describing the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by code that have been incorporated to minimize loss. The report should make specific reference to appropriate industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.

        (b) All interior walls separating records storage areas from each other and from other storage areas in the building must be at least three-hour fire barrier walls. A records storage facility may not store more than 250,000 cubic feet total of Federal records in a single records storage area. When Federal records are combined with other records in a single records storage area, only the Federal records will apply toward this limitation.

        (c) Fire barrier walls that meet the following specifications must be provided:

        (1) For existing records storage facilities, at least one-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces.

        (2) For new records storage facilities, two-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces. One exterior wall of each stack area must be designed with a maximum fire resistive rating of one hour, or, if rated more than one hour, there must be at least one knock-out panel in one exterior wall of each stack area.

        (d) Penetrations in the walls must not reduce the specified fire resistance ratings. The fire resistance ratings of structural elements and construction assemblies must be in accordance with ASTM E 119-98 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (e) The fire resistive rating of the roof must be a minimum of   hour for all records storage facilities, or must be protected by an automatic sprinkler system designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (f) Openings in fire barrier walls separating records storage areas must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. If openings are necessary, they must be protected by self-closing or automatic Class A fire doors, or equivalent doors that maintain the same rating as the wall.

        (g) Roof support structures that cross or penetrate fire barrier walls must be cut and supported independently on each side of the fire barrier wall.

        (h) If fire barrier walls are erected with expansion joints, the joints must be protected to their full height.

        (i) Building columns in the records storage areas must be at least 1-hour fire resistant or protected in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (j) Automatic roof vents for routine ventilation purposes must not be designed into new records storage facilities. Automatic roof vents, designed solely to vent in the case of a fire, with a temperature rating at least twice that of the sprinkler heads are acceptable.

        (k) Where lightweight steel roof or floor supporting members (e.g., bar joists having top chords with angles 2 by 12 inches or smaller, 1/4-inch thick or smaller, and 13/16-inch or smaller Web diameters) are present, they must be protected either by applying a 10-minute fire resistive coating to the top chords of the joists, or by retrofitting the sprinkler system with large drop sprinkler heads. If a fire resistive coating is applied, it must be a product that will not release (off gas) harmful fumes into the facility. If fire resistive coating is subject to air erosion or flaking, it must be fully enclosed in a drywall containment constructed of metal studs with fire retardant drywall. Retrofitting may require modifications to the piping system to ensure that adequate water capacity and pressure are provided in the areas to be protected with these large drop sprinkler heads.

        (l) Open flame (oil or gas) unit heaters or equipment, if used in records storage areas, must be installed or used in the records storage area in accordance with NFPA 54 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and the IAPMO/ANSI UMC 1, Uniform Mechanical Code (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (m) For existing records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 2-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.

        (n) For new records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 4-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.

        (o) For new records storage facilities, fuel supply lines must not be installed in areas containing records and must be separated from such areas with 4-hour rated construction assemblies.

        (p) Equipment rows running perpendicular to the wall must comply with NFPA 101 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), with respect to egress requirements.

        (q) No oil-type electrical transformers, regardless of size, except thermally protected devices included in fluorescent light ballasts, may be installed in the records storage areas. All electrical wiring must be in metal conduit, except that armored cable may be used where flexible wiring connections to light fixtures are required. Battery charging areas for electric forklifts must be separated from records storage areas with at least a 2-hour rated fire barrier wall.

        (r) Hazardous materials, including records on cellulose nitrate film, must not be stored in records storage areas. Nitrate motion picture film and nitrate sheet film may be stored in separate areas that meet the requirements of the appropriate NFPA standards, NFPA 40-1997 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), or NFPA 42 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (s) All record storage and adjoining areas must be protected by a professionally-designed fire-safety detection and suppression system that is designed to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 ounces of accelerant to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of records destroyed by fire. Section 1234.32 specifies how to document compliance with this requirement.

        § 1234.14   What are the requirements for environmental controls for records storage facilities?

#### § § 1234.14

        (a)  Paper-based temporary records must be stored under environmental conditions that prevent the active growth of mold. Exposure to moisture through leaks or condensation, relative humidities in excess of 70%, extremes of heat combined with relative humidity in excess of 55%, and poor air circulation during periods of elevated heat and relative humidity are all factors that contribute to mold growth.

        (b)  Nontextual temporary records, including microforms and audiovisual and electronic records, must be stored in records storage space that is designed to preserve them for their full retention period. New records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) no later than October 1, 2009. At a minimum, nontextual temporary records must be stored in records storage space that meets the requirements for medium term storage set by the appropriate standard in this paragraph (b). In general, medium term conditions as defined by these standards are those that will ensure the preservation of the materials for at least 10 years with little information degradation or loss. Records may continue to be usable for longer than 10 years when stored under these conditions, but with an increasing risk of information loss or degradation with longer times. If temporary records require retention longer than 10 years, better storage conditions (cooler and drier) than those specified for medium term storage will be needed to maintain the usability of these records. The applicable standards are:

        (1) ANSI/PIMA IT9.11 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);

        (2) ANSI/NAPM IT9.23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);

        (3) ANSI/PIMA IT9.25 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);

        (4) ANSI/NAPM IT9.20 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3); and/or

        (5) ANSI/NAPM IT9.18 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).

        (c)  Paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and sample/select records must be stored in records storage space that provides 24 hour/365 days per year air conditioning (temperature, humidity, and air exchange) equivalent to that required for office space. See ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and ASHRAE Standard 62 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), for specific requirements. New records storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) no later than October 1, 2009.

        (d)  All records storage facilities that store microfilm, audiovisual, and/or electronic permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must comply with the storage standards for permanent and unscheduled records in parts 1238, 1237, and/or 1236 of this subchapter, respectively.

      Subpart C—Handling Deviations From NARA's Facility Standards

        § 1234.20   What rules apply if there is a conflict between NARA standards and other regulatory standards that a facility must follow?

#### § § 1234.20

        (a) If any provisions of this part conflict with local or regional building codes, the following rules of precedence apply:

        (1) Between differing levels of fire protection and life safety, the more stringent provision applies; and

        (2) Between mandatory provisions that cannot be reconciled with a requirement of this part, the local or regional code applies.

        (b) If any of the provisions of this part conflict with mandatory life safety or ventilation requirements imposed on underground storage facilities by 30 CFR chapter I, 30 CFR chapter I applies.

        (c) NARA reserves the right to require documentation of the mandatory nature of the conflicting code and the inability to reconcile that provision with NARA requirements.

        § 1234.22   How does an agency request a waiver from a requirement in this part?

#### § § 1234.22

        (a)  NARA may approve exceptions to one or more of the standards in this part for:

        (1) Systems, methods, or devices that are demonstrated to have equivalent or superior quality, strength, fire resistance, effectiveness, durability, and safety to those prescribed by this subpart;

        (2) Existing agency records centers that met the NARA standards in effect prior to January 3, 2000, but do not meet a new standard required to be in place on September 28, 2005; and

        (3) The application of roof requirements in §§ 1234.10 and 1234.12 to underground storage facilities.

        (b)  The agency submits a waiver request, containing the information specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and/or (e) of this section to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.

        (c)  The agency's waiver request must contain:

        (1) A statement of the specific provision(s) of this part for which a waiver is requested, a description of the proposed alternative, and an explanation how it is equivalent to or superior to the NARA requirement; and

        (2) Supporting documentation that the alternative does not provide less protection for Federal records than that which would be provided by compliance with the corresponding provisions contained in this subpart. Documentation may take the form of certifications from a licensed fire protection engineer or a structural or civil engineer, as appropriate; reports of independent testing; reports of computer modeling; and/or other supporting information.

        (d)  The agency's waiver request must identify which requirement(s) the agency records center cannot meet and provide a plan with milestones for bringing the center into compliance.

        (e)  The agency's waiver request must identify the location of the facility and whether the facility is a drift entrance facility or a vertical access facility.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13655, Mar. 30, 2018]

        § 1234.24   How does NARA process a waiver request?

#### § § 1234.24

        (a)  NARA will review the waiver request and supporting documentation.

        (1) If in NARA's judgment the supporting documentation clearly supports the claim that the alternative is equivalent or superior to the NARA requirement, NARA will grant the waiver and notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days.

        (2) If NARA questions whether supporting documentation demonstrates that the proposed alternative offers at least equal protection to Federal records, NARA will consult the appropriate industry standards body or other qualified expert before making a determination. NARA will notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request that consultation is necessary and will provide a final determination within 60 calendar days. If NARA does not grant the waiver, NARA will furnish a full explanation of the reasons for its decision.

        (b)  NARA will review the agency's waiver request and plan to bring the facility into compliance.

        (1) NARA will approve the request and plan within 30 calendar days if NARA judges the planned actions and time frames for bringing the facility into compliance are reasonable.

        (2) If NARA questions the feasibility or reasonableness of the plan, NARA will work with the agency to develop a revised plan that NARA can approve and the agency can implement. NARA may grant a short-term temporary waiver, not to exceed 180 calendar days, while the revised plan is under development.

        (c)  NARA will normally grant the waiver and notify the requesting agency within 10 work days if the agency has not also requested a waiver of a different requirement under § 1234.30. If the agency has another waiver request pending for the same facility, NARA will respond to all of the waiver requests at the same time and within the longest time limits.

      Subpart D—Facility Approval and Inspection Requirements

        § 1234.30   How does an agency request authority to establish or relocate records storage facilities?

#### § § 1234.30

        (a)  Agencies are responsible for ensuring that records in their legal custody are stored in appropriate space as outlined in this part. Under § 1232.18(a), agencies are responsible for initiating action to remove records from space that does not meet these standards if deficiencies are not corrected within 6 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies by NARA or the agency and to complete removal of the records within 18 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies.

        (1)  Agencies must obtain prior written approval from NARA before establishing or relocating an agency records center. Each separate agency records center must be specifically approved by NARA prior to the transfer of any records to that individual facility. If an agency records center has been approved for the storage of Federal records of one agency, any other agency that proposes to store its records in that facility must still obtain NARA approval to do so.

        (2)  An agency may contract for commercial records storage services. However, before any agency records are transferred to a commercial records storage facility, the transferring agency must ensure that the facility meets all of the requirements for an agency records storage facility set forth in this subpart and must submit the documentation required in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b)  For purposes of this section, the term “agency records center” excludes NARA-owned and operated records centers. For purposes of this section and § 1234.34, the term “agency records center” also excludes agency records staging and/or holding areas with a capacity for containing less than 25,000 cubic feet of records. However, such records centers and areas, including records centers operated and maintained by NARA, must comply with the facility standards in §§ 1234.10 through 1234.14.

        (c)  Submit requests for authority to establish or relocate an agency records center, or to use an agency records center operated by another agency, to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The request must identify the specific facility and, for requests to establish or relocate the agency's own records center, document compliance with the standards in this subpart. Documentation requirements for § 1234.12(s) are specified in § 1234.32.

        (d)  NARA will review the submitted documentation to ensure the facility demonstrates full compliance with the standards in this subpart. NARA reserves the right to visit the facility, if necessary, to make the determination of compliance. NARA will inform the agency of its decision within 45 calendar days after the request is received, and will provide the agency information on the areas of noncompliance if the request is denied. Requests will be denied only if NARA determines that the facility does not demonstrate full compliance with the standards in this subpart. Approvals will be valid for a period of 10 years, unless the facility is materially changed before then or an agency or NARA inspection finds that the facility does not meet the standards in this subpart. Material changes require submission of a new request for NARA approval.

        (e)  At least 45 calendar days before an agency first transfers records to a commercial records storage facility, the agency must submit documentation to NARA that the facility complies with the standards in this subpart.  The documentation may take the form of a copy of the agency's contract that incorporates this subpart in its provisions or a statement from the agency records officer that certifies that the facility meets the standards in this subpart.  An agency must provide the documentation for each separate commercial records storage facility where its records will be stored. Send documentation to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The agency must submit updated documentation to NARA every 10 years if it continues to store records in that commercial records storage facility.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13655, Mar. 30, 2018]

        § 1234.32   What does an agency have to do to certify a fire-safety detection and suppression system?

#### § § 1234.32

        (a)  The agency must submit documentation to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, that describes the space being protected (e.g., the type and stacking height of the storage equipment used, or how the space is designed, controlled, and operated) and the characteristics of the fire-safety detection and suppression system used. The documentation must demonstrate how that system meets the requirement in § 1234.12(s) through:

        (1) A statement that the facility is using a NARA certified system as described in Appendix B to this part;

        (2) A report of the results of independent live fire testing (Factory Mutual, Underwriters Laboratories or Southwest Research Institute); or

        (3) A report under seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that:

        (i) Describes the design intent of the fire suppression system to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 fluid ounces of petroleum-type hydrocarbon accelerant (such as, for example, heptanes or gasoline) to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of Federal records destroyed by fire. The report need not predict a maximum single event loss at any specific number, but rather should describe the design intent of the fire suppression system. The report may make reasonable engineering and other assumptions such as that the fire department responds within XX minutes (the local fire department's average response time) and promptly commences suppression actions. In addition, any report prepared under this paragraph should assume that the accelerant is saturated in a cotton wick that is 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches long and sealed in a plastic bag and that the fire is started in an aisle at the face of a carton at floor level. Assumptions must be noted in the report;

        (ii) Details the characteristics of the system; and

        (iii) Describes the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by the applicable building code that have been incorporated to limit destruction of records. The report should make specific references to industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.

        (b)  (1) NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 10 work days if NARA has previously approved the system design for similarly configured space or if a report of independent testing of a new system design is furnished as documentation.

        (2) If, in NARA's judgment, the supporting documentation provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section clearly demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 30 calendar days.

        (3) If NARA questions whether supporting documentation demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will consult the appropriate industry standards body or other qualified expert before making a determination. Before any consultation, NARA may ask the agency for additional clarifying information. NARA will notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request that consultation is necessary and will provide a final determination within 60 calendar days. If NARA does not approve the system, NARA will furnish a full explanation of the reasons for its decision.

        (4) NARA will maintain a list of approved alternative systems.

        § 1234.34   When may NARA conduct an inspection of a records storage facility?

#### § § 1234.34

        (a) At the time an agency submits a request to establish an agency records center, pursuant to § 1234.30, NARA may conduct an inspection of the proposed facility to ensure that the facility complies fully with the standards in this subpart. NARA may also conduct periodic inspections of agency records centers so long as such facility is used as an agency records center. NARA will inspect its own records center facilities on a periodic basis to ensure that they are in compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

        (b) Agencies must ensure, by contract or otherwise, that agency and NARA officials, or their delegates, have the right to inspect commercial records storage facilities to ensure that such facilities fully comply with the standards in this subpart. NARA may conduct periodic inspections of commercial records storage facilities so long as agencies use such facilities to store agency records. The using agency, not NARA, will be responsible for paying any fee or charge assessed by the commercial records storage facility for NARA's conducting an inspection.

        (c) NARA will contact the agency operating the records center or the agency holding a contract with a commercial records storage facility in advance to set a date for the inspection.

#### § § 1235.10

        Agencies must transfer to the National Archives of the United States records that have been scheduled as permanent on an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, records that are designated as permanent in a GRS; and, when appropriate, records that are accretions to holdings (continuations of series already accessioned.)

        § 1235.12   When must agencies transfer records to the National Archives of the United States?

#### § § 1235.12

        Permanent records must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States when:

        (a) The records are eligible for transfer based on the transfer date specified in a NARA-approved records schedule, or

        (b) The records have been in existence for more than 30 years (see also § 1235.14).

        § 1235.14   May agencies retain records for the conduct of regular agency business after they are eligible for transfer?

#### § § 1235.14

        (a) Agencies may retain records longer than specified on a records disposition schedule only with written approval from NARA.

        (b) If the agency determines that the records are needed for the conduct of regular business, the records officer must submit a request certifying continuing need to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  This certification must:

        (1) Include a comprehensive description and location of records to be retained;

        (2) Cite the NARA-approved disposition authority;

        (3) Describe the current business for which the records are required;

        (4) Estimate the length of time the records will be needed (if no date is provided by the agency, approved certification requests will be effective for a maximum of five years);

        (5) Explain why agency needs cannot be met by NARA reference services or copies of records deposited in the National Archives of the United States; and

        (6) If records are retained to enable routine public reference by the agency rather than NARA, cite the statutory authority authorizing this agency activity.

> [74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13656, Mar. 30, 2018]

        (2) Function as an agency archives, unless specifically authorized by statute or by NARA.

        § 1235.18   How do agencies transfer records to the National Archives of the United States?

#### § § 1235.18

        Agencies transfer records by submitting a signed SF 258, Agreement to Transfer Records to the National Archives of the United States. Each SF 258 must correlate to a specific records series or other aggregation of records, as identified in an item on the SF 115 or cited on the SF 258.

        § 1235.20   How do agencies indicate that transferred records contain information that is restricted from public access?

#### § § 1235.20

        When completing an SF 258, agencies must indicate restrictions on the use and examination of records and attach a written justification. The justification must cite the statute or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption (5 U.S.C. 552(b) as amended), that authorizes the restrictions.

        § 1235.22   When does legal custody of records transfer to NARA?

#### § § 1235.22

        Legal custody of records passes from the agency to NARA when the appropriate NARA official signs the SF 258 acknowledging receipt of the records.

      Subpart B—Administration of Transferred Records

        § 1235.30   How may records in the National Archives of the United States be used?

#### § § 1235.30

        (a) NARA will enforce restrictions that are consistent with FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b) as amended) for both official use of the records by Federal agencies and research by the public.

        (b) NARA regulations in Subchapter C of this chapter apply to Federal agency personnel using transferred records for official Government purposes, and to the public at large.

        § 1235.32   How does NARA handle restrictions on transferred records?

#### § § 1235.32

        (a)  Unless required by law, NARA will remove or relax restrictions on transferred records less than 30 years old only with the written concurrence of the transferring agency or, if applicable, its successor agency. If the transferring agency no longer exists, and there is no successor, the Archivist may relax, remove, or impose restrictions to serve the public interest.

        (b)  (1) After records are more than 30 years old, most statutory and other restrictions on transferred records expire. NARA, however, after consulting with the transferring agency, may keep the restrictions in force for a longer period.

        (2) See part 1256 of this chapter for restrictions on specific categories of records, including national security classified information and information that would invade the privacy of an individual that NARA restricts beyond 30 years.

        § 1235.46   What electronic media may be used for transferring records to the National Archives of the United States?

#### § § 1235.46

        (a)  This section specifies the media or method used to transfer permanent records to the National Archives of the United States. (See 36 CFR 1236.28 for the requirements governing the selection of electronic records storage media for current agency use.) The agency must use only media that is are sound and free from defects for transfers to the National Archives of the United States. When permanent electronic records may be disseminated through multiple electronic media (e.g., magnetic tape, CD-ROM) or mechanisms (e.g., FTP), the agency and NARA must agree on the most appropriate medium or method for transfer of the records into the National Archives of the United States.

        (b)  Agencies may transfer electronic records to the National Archives of the United States on magnetic tape as follows:

        (1) Open-reel magnetic tape must be on  -inch 9-track tape reels recorded at 1600 or 6250 bpi that meet ANSI X3.39 or ANSI X3.54 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4), respectively.

        (2) 18-track 3480-class cartridges must be recorded at 37,871 bpi that meet ANSI X3.180 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4). The data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block.

        (3) For DLT tape IV cartridges, the data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block and must conform to the standards cited in the table as follows:

        (c)  Agencies may use CD-ROMs and DVDs to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives of the United States.

        (1) CD-ROMs used for this purpose must conform to ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).

        (2) Permanent electronic records must be stored in discrete files. Transferred CD-ROMs and DVDs may contain other files, such as software or temporary records, but all permanent records must be in files that contain only permanent records. Agencies must indicate at the time of transfer if a CD-ROM or DVD contains temporary records and where those records are located on the CD-ROM or DVD. The agency must also specify whether NARA should return the CD-ROM or DVD to the agency or dispose of it after copying the permanent records to an archival medium.

        (3) If permanent electronic records are stored on both CD-ROM (or DVD) and other media, such as magnetic tape, the agency and NARA must agree on the medium that will be used to transfer the records into the National Archives of the United States.

        (d)  Agencies may use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives of the United States only with NARA's approval. Several important factors may limit the use of FTP as a transfer method, including the number of records, record file size, and available bandwidth. Agencies must contact NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  (for digital photographs) or  (for electronic audiovisual records). For all other electronic records formats, contact NARA to initiate the transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  Each transfer of electronic records via FTP must be preceded with a signed SF 258 sent to RDE.

        (1) FTP file structure may use the 64-character Joliet extension naming convention only when letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (___) are used in the file and/or directory names, with a slash (/) used to indicate directory structures. Otherwise, FTP file structure must conform to an 8.3 file naming convention and file directory structure as cited in ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).

        (2) Permanent electronic records must be transferred in discrete files, separate from temporary files. All permanent records must be transferred in files that contain only permanent records.

Agencies must submit the required documentation, if electronic, in an electronic form that conforms to the provisions of this section.

        (b)  Documentation for data files and data bases must include record layouts, data element definitions, and code translation tables (codebooks) for coded data. Data element definitions, codes used to represent data values, and interpretations of these codes must match the actual format and codes as transferred.

        (c)  Digital geospatial data files must include the documentation specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, documentation for digital geospatial data files can include metadata that conforms to the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata, as specified in Executive Order 12906 of April 11, 1994 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 882) (Federal geographic data standards are available at ).

        (d)  Documentation for electronic files containing textual documents with SGML tags must include a table for interpreting the SGML tags, when appropriate.

        (e)  (1) This paragraph (e) applies to the documentation for the following types of electronic records:

        (i) E-mail messages with attachments;

        (ii) Scanned images of textual records;

        (iii) Records in portable document format (PDF);

        (iv) Digital photographic records; and

        (v) Web content records.

#### § § 1235.50

        (a)  (1) Agencies must transfer electronic records in a format that is independent of specific hardware or software. Except as specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the records must be written in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) with all control characters and other non-data characters removed. Consult NARA about electronic records in other formats, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at

        (2) Agencies must have advance approval from NARA for compression of the records, and agencies must comply with a request from NARA to provide the software to decompress the records.

        (3) Agencies interested in transferring scheduled electronic records using a Tape Archive (TAR) utility must contact NARA to initiate transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at

        (b)  Data files and databases must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States as flat files or as rectangular tables; , as two-dimensional arrays, lists, or tables. All “records” (within the context of the computer program, as opposed to a Federal record) or “tuples,” , ordered collections of data items, within a file or table must have the same logical format. Each data element within a record must contain only one data value. A record must not contain nested repeating groups of data items. The file must not contain extraneous control characters, except record length indicators for variable length records, or marks delimiting a data element, field, record, or file. If records or data elements in different files need to be linked or combined, then each record must contain one or more data elements that constitute primary and/or foreign keys enabling valid linkages between the related records in separate files.

        (c)  Digital spatial data files must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States in a format that complies with a non-proprietary, published open standard maintained by or for a Federal, national, or international standards organization. Acceptable transfer formats include the Geography Markup Language (GML) as defined by the Open GIS Consortium.

        (d)  Electronic textual documents must be transferred as plain ASCII files; however, such files may contain standard markup language such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or XML tags.

        (e)  For guidance on transferring these records to NARA, agencies should consult the transfer requirements available online at  or upon request from NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at

### Part 1236

**Authority:** Authority: 44 U.S.C. 2904, 3101, 3102, 3105, 3301, 3302, and 3312.

**Source:** Source: 74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General

        § 1236.2   Definitions that apply to this part.

#### § § 1236.2

        (a) See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1236.

        (b) As used in part 1236—

        are elements of information used to manage records and relate them to one another. _Administrative metadata_ elements describe how a record was created, any access and use restrictions that apply to it, information about the record series to which it belongs, and the disposition schedule that identifies its retention period.

        is a value that is computed on data and is used to authenticate information by indicating when a file has been corrupted or modified. This value is also called a “hash value,” “hash code,” “digest,” or simply “hash.”

        are elements of information that describe the records or set of records itself. They apply to both the source records and any versions produced through digitization. _Descriptive metadata_ for individual source records include such elements as the title of a record, a description of its contents, its creator, and the date it was created. These elements support searching for and discovering records.

        is the process of converting paper or analog records into electronic records.

        means an information system that contains and provides access to computerized Federal records and other information.

        means a computer application used to create, receive, and transmit messages and other documents. Excluded from this definition are file transfer utilities (software that transmits files between users but does not retain any transmission data), data systems used to collect and process data that have been organized into data files or data bases on either personal computers or mainframe computers, and word processing documents not transmitted on an e-mail system.

        are textual components that exist alongside the content (usually binary data) within the file. _Embedded metadata_ may be used to make self-describing digital files that contain administrative rights, and technical metadata and can be appropriately managed outside of a recordkeeping system.

        is the information necessary to identify and understand the content and context of the records.

        are the physical forms on which records are stored, such as paper, photographs, compact discs, DVDs, analog tapes, flash drives, local hard drives, or servers.

        consists of preserved contextual information describing the history, tracking, and/or management of an electronic document.

        are records in different forms of media. A file, when used in the phrase “mixed-media file,” is a group of records—regardless of location and type of media—that belong together or relate to a topic. For example, a mixed-media case file could be a box with paper notes, audio recordings of interviews, and a CD of photographs, along with physical evidence stored separately in an evidence locker. Records in a file may be in more than one media type because of how agencies create, maintain, and use records, shifts in technology, and the topic or activity involved.

        of source records include the media, the method that information is recorded, the physical condition of the material, and the smallest level of detail present. The physical characteristics of records printed on paper include: the type of paper (office paper, Thermofax, photographic print); the type of printing (laser printed, fax printed, typewritten, half-toned, handwritten); appearance (color, inks, continuous tone or monochrome images); size, and other methods of conveying information (embossed seals, stamps). These traits determine the methods and equipment used to digitize records.

        is having the information necessary to physically manage records. This includes knowing where the records are housed, whether any records are missing or stored separately, and the records' physical form (media types, the records' dimensions, and the physical characteristics).

        is a document that identifies the records that are to be digitized, an estimate of their volume and of the media types that are present, the image quality parameters selected to capture necessary information, the date range of the records, a copy of the applicable agency records schedule(s); any indexes used to maintain intellectual and physical control; and a quality management (QM) section that describes quality assurance (QA) objectives, quality control (QC) procedures to identify and correct errors during digitization, and the QC reports that will be used to identify and remediate errors when detected.

        refers to proactive QM activities focused on preventing defects by ensuring that a particular product or service achieves certain requirements or specifications. A QA program is heavily dependent on QC data to search for patterns and trends. QA activities also include controlled experiments, design reviews of digitization workflows, and system tests. QA programs can improve quality by creating plans and policies or by creating and conducting training.

        refers to QM activities that examine products through inspection or testing to determine if they meet predetermined specifications. The purpose is to detect defects (deviations from predetermined requirements) in products or processes.

        refers to the overall management functions and underlying activities that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities, and that implement them through planning, control, assurance, and improvement methods within the quality system.

        are elements of information that describe the properties of computer files, the hardware used to create them, and the parameters used by systems to render them. _Technical metadata_ may include elements such as a file's byte size, file format and version, color encoding, and the type of equipment used to make the file (for example, camera name or scanner manufacturer).

        means records created using office automation applications such as electronic mail and other messaging applications, word processing, or presentation software.

        is the process of ensuring that the records meet the requirements of this part.

        § 1236.4   What standards are used as guidance for this part?

#### § § 1236.4

        These regulations conform with ISO 15489-1:2001. Paragraph 9.6 (Storage and handling) is relevant to this part.

        § 1236.6   What are agency responsibilities for electronic records management?

#### § § 1236.6

        Agencies must:

        (a) Incorporate management of electronic records into the records management activities required by parts 1220-1235 of this subchapter;

        (b) Integrate records management and preservation considerations into the design, development, enhancement, and implementation of electronic information systems in accordance with subpart B of this part; and

        (c) Appropriately manage electronic records in accordance with subpart C of this part.

      Subpart B—Records Management and Preservation Considerations for Designing and Implementing Electronic Information Systems

        § 1236.10   What records management controls must agencies establish for records in electronic information systems?

#### § § 1236.10

        The following types of records management controls are needed to ensure that Federal records in electronic information systems can provide adequate and proper documentation of agency business for as long as the information is needed. Agencies must incorporate controls into the electronic information system or integrate them into a recordkeeping system that is external to the information system itself (see § 1236.20 of this part).

        (a)  Controls to ensure a full and accurate representation of the transactions, activities or facts to which they attest and can be depended upon in the course of subsequent transactions or activities.

        (b)  Controls to protect against unauthorized addition, deletion, alteration, use, and concealment.

        (c)  Controls, such as audit trails, to ensure records are complete and unaltered.

        (d)  Mechanisms to ensure records can be located, retrieved, presented, and interpreted.

        (e)  Mechanisms to preserve the information contained within the record itself that was produced by the creator of the record;

        (f)  Mechanisms to implement cross-references to related records that show the organizational, functional, and operational circumstances about the record, which will vary depending upon the business, legal, and regulatory requirements of the business activity; and

        (g) Structure: controls to ensure the maintenance of the physical and logical format of the records and the relationships between the data elements.

        § 1236.12   What other records management and preservation considerations must be incorporated into the design, development, and implementation of electronic information systems?

#### § § 1236.12

        As part of the capital planning and systems development life cycle processes, agencies must ensure:

        (a) That records management controls (see § 1236.10) are planned and implemented in the system;

        (b) That all records in the system will be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct agency business (i.e., for their NARA-approved retention period). Where the records will need to be retained beyond the planned life of the system, agencies must plan and budget for the migration of records and their associated metadata to new storage media or formats in order to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence. (See § 1236.14.)

        (c) The transfer of permanent records to NARA in accordance with part 1235 of this subchapter.

        (d) Provision of a standard interchange format (e.g., ASCII or XML) when needed to permit the exchange of electronic documents between offices using different software or operating systems.

        § 1236.14   What must agencies do to protect records against technological obsolescence?

#### § § 1236.14

        Agencies must design and implement migration strategies to counteract hardware and software dependencies of electronic records whenever the records must be maintained and used beyond the life of the information system in which the records are originally created or captured. To successfully protect records against technological obsolescence, agencies must:

        (a) Determine if the NARA-approved retention period for the records will be longer than the life of the system where they are currently stored. If so, plan for the migration of the records to a new system before the current system is retired.

        (b) Carry out upgrades of hardware and software in such a way as to retain the functionality and integrity of the electronic records created in them. Retention of record functionality and integrity requires:

        (1) Retaining the records in a usable format until their authorized disposition date. Where migration includes conversion of records, ensure that the authorized disposition of the records can be implemented after conversion;

        (2) Any necessary conversion of storage media to provide compatibility with current hardware and software; and

        (3) Maintaining a link between records and their metadata through conversion or migration, including capture of all relevant associated metadata at the point of migration (for both the records and the migration process).

        (c) Ensure that migration strategies address non-active electronic records that are stored off-line.

      Subpart C—Additional Requirements for Electronic Records

        § 1236.20   What are appropriate recordkeeping systems for electronic records?

#### § § 1236.20

        (a)  Agencies must use electronic or paper recordkeeping systems or a combination of those systems, depending on their business needs, for managing their records. Transitory e-mail may be managed as specified in § 1236.22(c).

        (b)  Recordkeeping functionality may be built into the electronic information system or records can be transferred to an electronic recordkeeping repository, such as a DoD-5015.2 STD-certified product. The following functionalities are necessary for electronic recordkeeping:

        (1)  Assign unique identifiers to records.

        (2)  Import records from other sources, manually enter records into the system, or link records to other systems.

        (3)  Associate with an approved records schedule and disposition instruction.

        (4)  Prevent the unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of declared records, and ensure that appropriate audit trails are in place to track use of the records.

        (5)  Establish the appropriate rights for users to access the records and facilitate the search and retrieval of records.

        (6)  Ensure that all records in the system are retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct agency business and to meet NARA-approved dispositions. Agencies must develop procedures to enable the migration of records and their associated metadata to new storage media or formats in order to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence.

        (7)  Identify and effect the transfer of permanent records to NARA based on approved records schedules. Identify and delete temporary records that are eligible for disposal. Apply records hold or freeze on disposition when required.

        (c)  System and file backup processes and media do not provide the appropriate recordkeeping functionalities and must not be used as the agency electronic recordkeeping system.

        § 1236.22   What are the additional requirements for managing electronic mail records?

#### § § 1236.22

        (a) Agencies must issue instructions to staff on the following retention and management requirements for electronic mail records:

        (1) The names of sender and all addressee(s) and date the message was sent must be preserved for each electronic mail record in order for the context of the message to be understood. The agency may determine that other metadata is needed to meet agency business needs, e.g., receipt information.

        (2) Attachments to electronic mail messages that are an integral part of the record must be preserved as part of the electronic mail record or linked to the electronic mail record with other related records.

        (3) If the electronic mail system identifies users by codes or nicknames or identifies addressees only by the name of a distribution list, retain the intelligent or full names on directories or distributions lists to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records.

        (4) Some e-mail systems provide calendars and task lists for users. These may meet the definition of Federal record. Calendars that meet the definition of Federal records are to be managed in accordance with the provisions of GRS 23, Item 5.

        (5) Draft documents that are circulated on electronic mail systems may be records if they meet the criteria specified in 36 CFR 1222.10(b) of this subchapter.

        (b) Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.

        (c) Agencies may elect to manage electronic mail records with very short-term NARA-approved retention periods (transitory records with a very short-term retention period of 180 days or less as provided by GRS 23, Item 7, or by a NARA-approved agency records schedule) on the electronic mail system itself, without the need to copy the record to a paper or electronic recordkeeping system, provided that:

        (1) Users do not delete the messages before the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period, and

        (2) The system's automatic deletion rules ensure preservation of the records until the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period.

        (d) Except for those electronic mail records within the scope of paragraph (c) of this section:

        (1) Agencies must not use an electronic mail system to store the recordkeeping copy of electronic mail messages identified as Federal records unless that system has all of the features specified in § 1236.20(b) of this part.

        (2) If the electronic mail system is not designed to be a recordkeeping system, agencies must instruct staff on how to copy Federal records from the electronic mail system to a recordkeeping system.

        (e) Agencies that retain permanent electronic mail records scheduled for transfer to the National Archives must either store them in a format and on a medium that conforms to the requirements concerning transfer at 36 CFR part 1235 or maintain the ability to convert the records to the required format and medium at the time transfer is scheduled.

        (f) Agencies that maintain paper recordkeeping systems must print and file their electronic mail records with the related transmission and receipt data specified by the agency's electronic mail instructions.

        § 1236.24   What are the additional requirements for managing unstructured electronic records?

#### § § 1236.24

        (a) Agencies that manage unstructured electronic records electronically must ensure that the records are filed in a recordkeeping system that meets the requirements in § 1236.10, except that transitory e-mail may be managed in accordance with § 1236.22(c).

        (b) Agencies that maintain paper files as their recordkeeping systems must establish policies and issue instructions to staff to ensure that unstructured records are printed out for filing in a way that captures any pertinent hidden text (such as comment fields) or structural relationships (e.g., among worksheets in spreadsheets or other complex documents) required to meet agency business needs.

        § 1236.26   What actions must agencies take to maintain electronic information systems?

#### § § 1236.26

        (a) Agencies must maintain inventories of electronic information systems and review the systems periodically for conformance to established agency procedures, standards, and policies as part of the periodic reviews required by 44 U.S.C. 3506. The review should determine if the records have been properly identified and described, and if the schedule descriptions and retention periods reflect the current informational content and use. If not, agencies must submit an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, to NARA.

        (b) Agencies must maintain up-to-date documentation about electronic information systems that is adequate to:

        (1) Specify all technical characteristics necessary for reading and processing the records contained in the system;

        (2) Identify all inputs and outputs;

        (3) Define the contents of the files and records;

        (4) Determine restrictions on access and use;

        (5) Understand the purpose(s) and function(s) of the system;

        (6) Describe update cycles or conditions and rules for adding, changing, or deleting information in the system; and

        (7) Ensure the timely, authorized disposition of the records.

        § 1236.28   What additional requirements apply to the selection and maintenance of electronic records storage media for permanent records?

#### § § 1236.28

        (a) Agencies must maintain the storage and test areas for electronic records storage media containing permanent and unscheduled records within the following temperature and relative humidity ranges:

        (1) Temperature—62° to 68 °F.

        (2) Relative humidity—35% to 45%.

        (b) Electronic media storage libraries and test or evaluation areas that contain permanent or unscheduled records must be smoke-free.

        (c) For additional guidance on the maintenance and storage of CDs and DVDS, agencies may consult the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 500-252, Care and Handling of CDs and DVDs at  contact phone number (301) 975-6478.

        (d) Agencies must test magnetic computer tape media no more than 6 months prior to using them to store electronic records that are unscheduled or scheduled for permanent retention. This test should verify that the magnetic computer tape media are free of permanent errors and in compliance with NIST or industry standards.

        (e) Agencies must annually read a statistical sample of all magnetic computer tape media containing permanent and unscheduled records to identify any loss of data and to discover and correct the causes of data loss. In magnetic computer tape libraries with 1800 or fewer tape media, a 20% sample or a sample size of 50 media, whichever is larger, should be read. In magnetic computer tape libraries with more than 1800 media, a sample of 384 media should be read. Magnetic computer tape media with 10 or more errors should be replaced and, when possible, lost data must be restored. All other magnetic computer tape media which might have been affected by the same cause (i.e., poor quality tape, high usage, poor environment, improper handling) must be read and corrected as appropriate.

        (f) Before the media are 10 years old, agencies must copy permanent or unscheduled data on magnetic records storage media onto tested and verified new electronic media.

      Subpart E—Digitizing Permanent Federal Records

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 28417, May 4, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1236.40   Scope of this subpart.

#### § § 1236.40

        (a) This subpart establishes processes and requirements to ensure that agencies:

        (1) Identify the records the agency will digitize in each project;

        (2) Account for all records covered by the project, regardless of media type;

        (3) Implement quality management techniques to verify equipment performance and monitor processes to detect and correct errors;

        (4) Produce complete and accurate digitized records that the agency can use for all the same purposes as the source records; and

        (5) Validate that the resulting digitized records meet the standards in this subpart.

        (b) This subpart covers the standards and procedures agencies must apply when digitizing permanent paper records using reflective digitization techniques. Such records include most paper-based documents, regardless of size, such as modern textual documents, maps, posters, manuscripts, graphic arts prints (for example, lithographs or intaglio), drawings, bound volumes, and photographic prints. This subpart also covers any records that may be incorporated into mixed-media records.

        (c) This subpart does not cover standards and procedures agencies must apply when digitizing permanent records using transmissive digitization techniques. Such records include photographic negatives, transparencies, aerial film, roll film, and micrographic and radiographic materials. In addition, this subpart does not cover digitizing records on dynamic media. Such records include motion picture film, video, and audio tapes.

        (d) For guidance on digitizing out-of-scope media types or non-paper-based portions of mixed-media records, such as dynamic media, radiographic, negative or positive film, or other special media types, please contact the Records Management Policy and Standards Team by email at  or by phone at 301-837-1948.

Agencies should work with their legal counsel and other officials to ensure compliance with these and other applicable requirements.

        (g) This subpart also does not address other business needs or legal constraints that may make it necessary for an agency to retain source records for a period of time after digitizing. Agencies should work with their legal counsel and other officials to determine whether such retention might be necessary because it relates to rights and interests, appeal rights, benefits, national security, litigation holds, or other similar reasons.

        § 1236.41   Definitions for this subpart.

#### § § 1236.41

        In addition to the definitions contained in § 1220.18 of this subchapter and § 1236.2, the following definitions apply to this subpart:

        is the degree to which the information correctly describes the object or process being measured. It can be thought of in terms of how close a reading or average of readings is to a true or target value. _Accuracy_ is a different measure than precision.

        is a red, green, blue color space developed to display on computer monitors most of the colors that CMYK color printers produce. The _Adobe RGB_ color space is significantly larger than the sRGB color space, particularly in the cyan and green regions.

        is a specific value assigned to a given metric to assess performance achievement.

        is a general term to describe a broad range of undesirable flaws or distortions in digital reproductions produced during image capture or data processing. Some common forms of image artifacts include noise, chromatic aberration, blooming, interpolation, and imperfections created by compression.

        is a group of files that are created under the same conditions or are related intellectually or physically. During digitization, batches represent groups of records that are digitized and undergo QC inspection processes together.

        is the number of bits used to represent each pixel in an image. The term is sometimes used to represent bits per pixel and at other times, the total number of bits used multiplied by the number of total channels. For example, a typical color image using 8 bits per channel is often referred to as a 24-bit color image (8 bits x 3 channels). Color scanners and digital cameras typically produce 24-bit (8 bits x 3 channels) images or 36-bit (12 bits x 3 channels) capture, and high-end devices can produce 48-bit (16-bit x 3 channels) images. _Bit depth_ is also referred to as “color depth.”

        is the abrupt truncation of a signal when the signal exceeds a system's ability to differentiate signal values above or below a particular level. In the case of images, the result is that there is no differentiation of light tones when the clipping is at the high end of signal amplitude, and no differentiation of dark tones when clipping occurs at the low end of signal amplitude.

        is a subtractive color model used in printing that is based on cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). These are typically referred to as “process colors.” Cyan absorbs the red component of white light, magenta absorbs green, and yellow absorbs blue. In theory, the mix of the three colors will produce black, but black ink is also used to increase the density of black in a print.

        is measured by computing the color difference (ΔE2000) between the digital imaging results of the standard target patches and their premeasured color values. By imaging an appropriate target and evaluating through the software, variances from known values can be determined, which is a good indicator of how accurately the system is recording color. Analytical software measures the average deviation of all color patches measured (the mean).

        is the measurement of color-to-color spatial dislocation of otherwise spatially coincident color features of a digitized object.

        is using software, hardware, and procedures to measure and control color in an imaging system, including capture and display devices.

        is a specific organization of colors that supports reproducible representations of color in combination with color profiling supported by various devices. A color space can be a helpful conceptual tool for describing or understanding the color capabilities of a particular device or digital file. Examples of color spaces include Adobe RGB 1998, sRGB, ECIRGB_v2, and ProPhoto RGB.

        is a technique for data compression that will allow the decompressed data to be exactly the same as the original data before compression, bit-for-bit. The compression of data is achieved by coding redundant data in a more efficient manner than in the uncompressed format.

        is a form or manner of lossy compression where the data that is lost after the file is compressed and decompressed is not detectable to the human eye; the compressed data appearing identical to the uncompressed data.

        is the measurement and monitoring component of the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) Conformance Program. The program consists of measuring ISO-compliant reference targets and using analysis software such as OpenDICE for testing and monitoring digitization programs to ensure they meet FADGI technical parameters. Agencies can access FADGI-compliant tools and resources online at

        is any action an agency (including an agent acting on the agency's behalf, such as a contractor) takes to digitize permanent records. For example, a digitization project can range from a one-time digitization effort to a multiyear digitization process; can involve digitizing a single document into a digital records management system or digitizing boxes of records from storage facilities; or can include digitizing active records as part of an ongoing business process or digitizing inactive records for better access.

        is a digital record created by converting paper or other media formats to a digital form that is of sufficient authenticity, reliability, usability, and integrity to serve in place of the source record.

        is the ratio between the smallest and largest possible values of a changeable quantity, frequently encountered in imaging or recorded sound. _Dynamic range_ is another way of stating the maximum signal-to-noise ratio.

        is a collaborative effort by Federal agencies to articulate Technical Guidelines that form the basis for many of the technical parameters in this part, which equate to the FADGI three-star level. Agencies can access FADGI online at

        is an image type lacking any chromatic data, consisting of shades of gray ranging from white to black. Most commonly seen as having 8 bits per pixel, allowing for 256 shades or levels of intensity.

        is the degree of perceived or objective measurement of a digital image's overall accuracy in faithfully reproducing an original. A digital image created to a high degree of accuracy meets or exceeds objective performance attributes (such as level of detail, tonal and color fidelity, and correct exposure), and has minimal defects (such as noise, compression artifacts, or distortion).

        measures how evenly a lens records the lighting of neutral reference targets from center to edge and between points within the image.

        is the modulation ratio between the output image and the ideal image. SFR measures the imaging system's ability to maintain contrast between progressively smaller image details. Using these two functions, a system can make an accurate determination of resolution related to the sampling frequency.

        are interference patterns that appear as a series of concentric, alternating light and dark rings of colored light (when imaged in a color mode). This type of interference is caused when smooth transparent surfaces come into contact with small gaps of air between the surfaces. The light waves reflect from the top and bottom surfaces of the air film formed between the surfaces, causing light rays to constructively or destructively interfere with each other. The areas where there is constructive interference will appear as light bands and the areas where there is destructive interference will appear as dark bands.

        is one or more undesirable image artifact(s) in a digitized record that is not part of the source material.

        describes the resolution capabilities of an imaging device, such as a scanner, or the resolution of a digital image. PPI is different from dots per inch (dpi).

        is an effect produced by reducing the number of tones (colors) in an image so that there is a noticeable distinction between one tone and another instead of a gradual shift between them.

        is the characteristic of measurement that relates to the consistency between multiple measurements, under uniform conditions, of the same item or process. As opposed to accuracy, precision does not indicate how close a measurement is to a true value.

        is a lossy compression technique that involves compressing a range of values to a single quantum value, usually to reduce file size. This may result in flaws in an image, such as posterization, caused by reducing the data available in an image file to represent aspects like colors.

        is a digitally encoded representation of a subject's tonal and brightness information into a bitmap. Data from digital cameras and scanning devices record light characteristics as numerical values into a grid, or raster, of picture elements (pixels).

        is a chart of test patterns and patches with known standard values used to evaluate the performance of an imaging system.

        is a process in which an imaging system captures reflected light off of scanned objects such as bound volumes, loose pages, cartographic materials, illustrations, posters, photographic prints, or newsprint.

        measures the relationship between the physical size of the original object and the size in pixels per inch (PPI) of that object in the digital image.

        is the level of spatial detail rendered by an imaging system as measured by MTF/SFR.

        measures the imaging spatial resolution and is computed as the physical pixel count or pixels per unit of measurement, such as pixels per inch (PPI). This parameter provides information about the size of the original and the data needed to determine the level of detail recorded in the file. ( modulation transfer function (MTF)/spatial frequency response (SFR).)

        artificially enhances details to create the illusion of greater definition. Image quality testing using the SFR quantifies the level of sharpening introduced by imaging systems or applied by users in post-processing actions.

        is the record from which a digitized version or digitized record is created. The source record should be the record copy that was used in the course of agency business.

        determines the amount (for example, quantity, PPI, megapixels) of data in a raster image file in terms of the number of picture elements or pixels per unit of measurement, but it does not define or guarantee the quality of the information. _Spatial resolution_ defines how finely or widely spaced the individual pixels are from each other. The actual rendition of fine detail is more dependent on the SFR of the scanner or digital camera.

        is a standard RGB color space created by HP and Microsoft for use on monitors, printers, and the internet. _sRGB_ uses the ITU-R BT.709-5 primaries that are also used in studio monitors and HDTV, and a transfer function (gamma correction) typical of CRTs (cathode ray tube TVs and computer monitors), all of which permits sRGB to be directly displayed on typical monitors. The sRGB gamma is not represented by a single numerical value. The overall gamma is approximately 2.2, consisting of a linear (gamma 1.0) section near black, and a non-linear section elsewhere involving a 2.4 exponent and a gamma changing from 1.0 through about 2.3.

        is the allowable deviation from a specified value.

        is a measure of how accurately the digital imaging system converts light levels into digital pixels.

        is a process in which the system transmits light through a photographic slide or negative.

        is a measurement of the digital file's color neutrality. The definition of “neutral” is not universal: RGB workflows that use digital count values encode neutral as defined by the International Color Consortium (ICC) color space chosen. L*a*b* workflows define neutral as 0 on the a* axis and b* axis, with the lightness recorded from 0-100 on the L* axis.

        § 1236.42   Records management requirements.

#### § § 1236.42

        (a) Before starting a digitization project, agencies must establish intellectual control of the records that will be digitized. Intellectual control means having the information necessary to identify and understand the content and context of the records. One traditional records management technique to establish intellectual control is the creation of an inventory. The inventory must identify whether the records are complete, if there are any gaps in coverage or missing records, the presence of any mixed-media records, the disposition schedule under which the records fall, the date range when the records were created, any access or use restrictions that apply to the records, and the records' storage location.

        (b) Agencies must identify any relationships between the source records in order to retain these relationships between the digitized versions. For example, are there case files that are associated by case number? Does a folder contain multiple documents that are stapled together? Are there digital components of a mixed-media file stored on removable media (DVD or USB drives)? What is the relationship of the folder to other folders in a box? Any relationships must be captured as part of the digitization process:

        (1) Through metadata (See § 1236.54 for metadata requirements);

        (2) By organizing the folder structure of a file system;

        (3) By using file formats that allow for multi-page files, such as PDF or TIFF; or

        (4) Through a combination of these approaches.

        (c) In addition, the inventory can be used to identify all the elements of physical control needed for the records to be digitized. Physical control includes understanding the physical characteristics of source records. Physical characteristics determine a project's scope, and the image capture techniques and equipment to be used. For example, the type of paper, the type of printing, or the size of the records can impact what methods and equipment are used to digitize records.

        (d) There are additional considerations for managing the source records during the digitization process:

        (1) Ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the source records to prevent their loss or damage.

        (2) Restrict access to source records while they are being digitized to minimize the risk of unauthorized additions, deletions, or alterations.

        (3) Ensure there is a process to identify and document gaps in coverage or missing records.

        (e) Agencies must ensure that records are free from unauthorized alteration, destruction, or deletion by complying with the mechanisms and controls specified in §§ 1236.10 and 1236.20:

        (1) The agency may generate checksums using the SHA-256 hash algorithm and record them as technical metadata in a recordkeeping system for each image file when digitization is complete and the agency determines that the records are no longer in active use and the metadata are no longer subject to any changes that may result from ongoing business use. Use the checksums to monitor the digitized records for corruption or alteration and capture them as metadata as required in § 1236.54; or

        (2) The agency may perform file integrity monitoring or file comparison audits.

        (f) If there are born-digital records that are part of the record series within the project, follow the instructions for managing mixed-media records in § 1236.52.

        § 1236.44   Documenting digitization projects.

#### § § 1236.44

        Agencies must create digital documentation when digitizing permanent source records. The agency must retain this documentation alongside the digitized records until the digitized records have been transferred to NARA and NARA has notified the agency that the accessioning process is complete. The agency must dispose of the documentation in accordance with an appropriate General Records Schedule (GRS) or agency records schedule. The required documentation will help the agency populate the Transfer Request instrument (TR) in NARA's Electronic Records Archives (ERA). The following documents are required:

        (a) A defined project plan that identifies:

        (1) Record series or file units to be digitized;

        (2) Method that will be used to name digitized records;

        (3) Estimated date range of the source records;

        (4) Missing pages;

        (5) Gaps or missing records in the series. Depending on the type of gap or missing records, indicate if there will be charge-out cards for skipped or missing records that will be inter-filed if they are transferred at a later date;

        (6) Estimated volume, media types, dimensions, physical characteristics, and condition of the source records;

        (7) Equipment and software used to digitize records;

        (8) Estimated file storage requirements for the digitized records. The file storage needs may affect project decisions, such as compression and file format;

        (9) Any access or use restrictions that apply to the records;

        (10) Method used to capture the relationships that exist between source records once they are digitized; and

        (11) Any metadata element labels that differ from those specified in § 1236.54.

        (b) Any information needed to associate the digitized records to the source records' agency records schedule(s) including the item numbers;

        (c) Any related finding aids, indexes, inventories, logs, registers, or metadata schemas the agency uses to manage the records that can serve as sources for the metadata required in § 1236.54.

        (d) A quality management (QM) plan that ensures the project meets the quality assurance (QA) objectives and quality control (QC) inspection procedures.

        (1) The quality management plan must include the policies, functions, roles, responsibilities, requirements, and objectives for the project.

        (2) The quality assurance component of the QM plan must include documentation of:

        (i) Image quality performance parameters selected to capture the information present in the source records;

        (ii) Equipment and device acceptance testing methods and results;

        (iii) Design reviews to evaluate if digitization workflows meet the requirements; and

        (iv) Training conducted.

        (3) The quality control component of the QM plan must document:

        (i) The procedures used to inspect image quality;

        (ii) The procedures used to inspect metadata quality;

        (iii) The corrective actions taken to mitigate deviations throughout all phases of the project; and

        (iv) The procedures used to verify that digitized records conform to the requirements.

        § 1236.46   Quality management requirements.

#### § § 1236.46

        (a)  The agency must meet the image quality performance parameters specified in § 1236.50 by verifying how well the equipment meets the aim points and tolerances of the parameters. The agency cannot rely solely on equipment specifications, such as scanner ppi settings or camera sensor megapixels, to ensure digital image quality.

        (1) The agency must use QA processes to:

        (i) Quantify scanner or camera performance before selecting the equipment by scanning a reference target and measuring the results with analytical software to determine if the equipment meets the technical parameters.

        (ii) Evaluate internal or external vendor imaging systems against image quality performance parameters;

        (iii) Monitor equipment performance by quantifying scanner or camera performance during digitization; and

        (iv) Verify that resulting digital files meet project specifications.

        (b)  The agency must implement QC inspection and monitoring processes to ensure that images meet the digitization image quality parameters in § 1236.50.

        (1) The Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) Digital Image Conformance Evaluation program (DICE) is a QC inspection and monitoring process that uses image targets and analysis software to verify compliance. Applied properly, this methodology will ensure agencies meet the requirements in § 1236.50.

        (2) If the agency does not adopt the FADGI Conformance Evaluation program, it must document both the procedures used and how it verified conformance to the quality parameters.

        (c)  During the digitization process, the agency must perform QC testing and analysis to identify malfunctioning or improperly configured digitization equipment, improper software application settings, incorrect metadata capture, or human error, and take corrective actions. It must:

        (1) Implement an image quality analysis process and use reference targets to verify that digitization devices conform to imaging parameters in this subpart;

        (2) Replace reference targets as they fade or accumulate dirt, scratches, and other surface marks that reduce their usability;

        (3) Regularly test equipment to ensure scanners and digital cameras/copy systems are performing optimally. It must:

        (i) Scan a reference target containing a grayscale, color chart, and accurate dimensional scale at the beginning of each workday;

        (ii) Use image quality analysis software to verify that the performance evaluation specifications are being met; and

        (iii) Perform additional tests when problems are detected.

        (4) Test equipment with the specific software/device driver combination(s), and re-test after any changes to the workflow; and

        (5) Ensure that equipment operation, settings, and image processing actions are the same as those used to evaluate the test target. Turn off auto correction settings in the capture equipment such as “auto exposure” that may cause non-conformance of the target evaluation or the resulting image files.

        (d)  (1) The agency must perform QC inspections of the digital records for compliance with the technical parameters and criteria specified in this subpart. The inspection must ensure 100% of the image files:

        (i) Can open and be displayed;

        (ii) Are encoded with a compression type and in a format specified in § 1236.48; and

        (iii) Have the resolution, color mode, bit depth, and color profile specified in § 1236.50.

        (2) The agency must perform a visual inspection using a statistically valid technique:

        (i) The agency may visually inspect a random sample of a minimum of ten digital records or 10% of each batch of digital records, whichever is larger; or

        (ii) The agency may employ a statistically valid sampling plan to verify that the image quality, file quality, metadata quality, and completeness requirements have been met. Agencies that employ their own sampling technique must include documentation of the method used, as specified in § 1236.44(d)(3)(i).

        (3) Visual inspection must be conducted using a calibrated graphics workstation and using a monitor set to 100% magnification to check the following image quality characteristics:

        (i) Image tone, brightness, contrast, and color accuracy match the specifications in § 1236.50;

        (ii) Images are free from clipping (missing detail lost in highlights or shadows);

        (iii) Images are free from color channel misregistration, or quantization errors;

        (iv) Images are free of any image artifacts that compromise the informational content of the record, such as dust, Newton's rings, missing pixels, scan lines, drop-outs, flare, or over-sharpening; and

        (v) Images are not improperly cropped, have the expected dimensions and orientation (landscape/horizontal or portrait/vertical), and images are not flipped, inverted, or skewed.

        (e)  If the inspection reveals errors, perform the following steps until there is a 100% success rate for the sample set:

        (1) If 1% or more of examined records fail to meet any of the criteria in § 1236.50, determine the source and scope of any errors, correct or re-digitize affected records, and reinspect the images by following the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section;

        (2) If less than 1% of examined records fail to meet any of the criteria in § 1236.50, determine the source and scope of any errors and correct or re-digitize the affected records.

        (f)  The agency must inspect the resulting files to verify that they meet the metadata and records completeness requirements:

        (1)  The agency must evaluate the accuracy of metadata. This may be done using automated techniques if appropriate. Otherwise, the QC inspections must be done manually. These inspections must ensure that:

        (i) Files are named according to project specifications; and

        (ii) Correct administrative, descriptive, and technical metadata are captured in a recordkeeping system and in image files.

        (2)  The agency must employ automated and visual inspection processes to verify the completeness and accuracy of digitization:

        (i) Verify that all records have been accounted for by referring to box lists, folder title lists, or other inventories;

        (ii) Compare source records with their digitized versions to verify that 100% of the informational content has been captured;

        (iii) Compare source records with their digitized versions to verify the digitized records are in the same order;

        (iv) Examine records for related envelopes, notes, or other forms of media to verify that all sources of record information have been digitized;

        (v) Verify that any mixed-media records that cannot be digitized are associated with the digitized records using the “Relation” metadata elements in § 1236.54(c); and

        (vi) Confirm that missing pages or images have been noted in the project documentation.

        § 1236.48   File format requirements.

#### § § 1236.48

        (a) The agency must encode, retain, and transfer digitized records in one of the following file formats, either uncompressed or using one of the specified compression codecs in tables 1 and 2 to this section.

        (1) Agencies that combine multiple uncompressed TIFF images into PDF/A files using JPEG2000 compression must perform the quality inspection step specified in 1236.46(d) against the resulting PDF/A files.

        (2) When using JPEG 2000 visually lossless compression, agencies must determine the amount of compression to apply, not to exceed 20:1, by performing tests and visually evaluating for compression artifacts that obscure or alter the information content.

        (b) The agency must encode, retain, and transfer digitized permanent paper records in one of the following file formats, either uncompressed or with one of the compression codecs specified in table 1 to this paragraph (b).

        (c) The agency must encode, retain, and transfer digitized photographic print records in one of the following file formats, either uncompressed or with one of the compression codecs specified in the table 2 to this paragraph (c).

        (1) For a series of predominantly textual records with interspersed photographic prints, use the formats in table 1 to paragraph (b) of this section for paper records. All photographic prints must be digitized according to the standards in § 1236.50.

        (2) For a series of predominantly printed photographs, including those with paper records interspersed, use the file formats in table 2 to this paragraph (c) for photographic print records.

        (3) However, the agency must not transcode, or interpolate (upsample) files anywhere in the workflow.

        § 1236.50   Requirements for digitizing permanent paper and photographic print records.

#### § § 1236.50

        (a)  This section describes the minimum requirements appropriate for digitizing paper records. Depending on the physical characteristics of the source records, the agency must select the applicable specifications described in either table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section for modern textual paper records or the table 2 to paragraph (e) of this section for photographic prints and paper records with fine details. Agencies must implement appropriate equipment, lighting, special handling, or imaging methods to ensure the capture of all information. Agencies may exceed these requirements, if necessary, to capture fine detail or to meet their own business needs.

        (b)  The performance parameters are based on FADGI three-star aim points and tolerance ranges.

        (c)  The equipment used to digitize Federal records must be appropriate for the media type, and capable of achieving documented project objectives without damaging the source records.

        (d)  For these records, produce image files at a minimum of 300 ppi sized to the source document.

        (1) Records suitable for the specifications in table 1 to this paragraph (d) for modern textual paper records are modern textual documents with a well-defined printed type (such as typeset, typed, laser-printed), and with moderate to high contrast between the ink of the text and the paper background. Performance metric values in table 1 for modern textual paper records conform to the FADGI “Documents (Unbound): Modern Textual Records” category, and are appropriate when source records do not have visible content with L* values darker than 20. Neutral reference patches on the evaluation test target with L* less than 20 are not used for analysis.

        (2) For other paper records such as manuscripts, illustrations, graphics, and documents with poor legibility or diffuse characters (such as carbon copies or Thermofax) that have visible content with L* values darker than 20, agencies must evaluate neutral reference patches on the evaluation test target with L* greater than 20. (These values equate to FADGI three-star for “Documents (Unbound): General Collections”).

        (3) The agency must digitize in an acceptable RGB color mode if records contain color or other characteristics that are necessary to interpret the information of the source record, or that would be lost when digitizing using grayscale gamma 2.2.

        (4) At a minimum, the agency must digitize the paper records covered by this paragraph to the following parameters:

        (e)  Records that have fine detail, require a high degree of color accuracy, or have other unique characteristics, must be captured using the specifications in table 2 to this paragraph (e) for photographic prints and paper records with fine details. For these records, produce image files (as described table 2) at a minimum of 400 ppi sized to the source document (these performance values equate to FADGI three-star category “Prints and Photographs”). It may be necessary to apply a higher resolution than the minimum for some records that have fine detail.

        (1) These specifications apply to records such as photographic prints, graphic-arts prints (for example, lithographs or intaglio), drawings, embossed seals, and records that have information that cannot be captured by the parameters in table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section for modern textual paper records.

        (i) For records in which the smallest significant detail is 1.0 mm or smaller, such as aerial photographs and topographic maps (which require a high degree of enlargement and precision to ensure the dimensional accuracy of the scans), the agency must increase the resolution to capture all the information in the source record.

        (ii) For many imaging devices, increasing the ppi settings may not increase the actual resolution level or capture the desired detail. The equipment for digitizing records with fine detail must be capable of meeting the higher quality parameters. It may be necessary to exceed the parameters in table 2 to this paragraph (e) to capture all the information inherent in the records.

        (2) The agency must digitize photographic prints, including monochrome and black and white, using a color mode.

        (3) The agency must digitize in an acceptable color mode if records contain color or other characteristics that are necessary to interpret the information of the source record, or that would be lost when digitizing using grayscale gamma 2.2.

        (4) At a minimum, agencies must digitize all records covered by this paragraph to the following parameters:

        § 1236.52   Requirements for digitizing permanent mixed-media records.

#### § § 1236.52

        Mixed-media files are records that belong together or relate to a common topic and are stored on more than one media type. Mixed-media files result from the processes agencies use to create, maintain, and use records. For example, a case file may include paper records, online digital records, and digital records on storage media.

        (a) For any non-paper media, agencies must analyze the contents to determine whether any files are records.

        (1) If the media contains records that are temporary, manage them according to their appropriate GRS or agency-specific records authority.

        (2) If the media contains records that are permanent, but not part of the digitized record series, locate their disposition schedule and capture them in a digital information system that complies with the requirements in § 1222.26 of this subchapter and §§ 1236.10 through 1236.14.

        (3) If the media contains born-digital components of mixed-media files that are related to the digitized records series, capture the born-digital records in a recordkeeping system in accordance with § 1222.26 of this subchapter and associate the born-digital records with any related records once they are digitized using the “Relation” metadata elements in § 1236.54.

        (4) If they are permanent records stored on a media type that is out of scope for this subpart, document this information according to the instructions in § 1236.44. Agencies must maintain the association between records using the “Relation” metadata elements specified in § 1236.54.

        (b) Contact the Records Management Policy and Standards Team at  for guidance on what to do with types of media in a mixed-media file that are outside the scope of this subpart, such as dynamic media, x-rays, negative or positive film, or other special media types.

        § 1236.54   Metadata requirements.

#### § § 1236.54

        (a)  To ensure that intellectual and physical control of the digital records can be maintained, this regulation specifies metadata elements that must be captured in a recordkeeping system, or embedded in each file, or both captured in a recordkeeping system and embedded in each file. Ensure that the metadata remains accurate and consistent regardless of where it is stored.

        (1) If using metadata to capture relationships between source records as required in § 1236.42(b), agencies must use the “Relation” metadata elements in table 1 to paragraph (c)(1) of this section for basic administrative metadata.

        (2) If using different metadata labels from the ones required in this section, agencies must document the labels that the agency uses and note this in the Details section of the ERA (Electronic Records Archive) Transfer Request (TR).

        (3) Determine the appropriate level to be used as the source of descriptive metadata. Depending on the agency's existing recordkeeping practices and level of intellectual control, use information from the project, record series, file unit, or item level as the source for administrative, technical, and descriptive metadata fields. If the components of a record have not been individually indexed with unique descriptions, apply the series or file unit-level descriptions to all of the image files within that grouping. If the components of the record do not have individual titles, the agency must apply the item Record IDs instead.

        (4) Include additional metadata if it is captured. If other metadata elements are provided in addition to the metadata requirements in this subpart, NARA will accept that metadata as part of the transfer process.

        (b)  Agencies must:

        (1) Capture the metadata specified by paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section at the file or item level as part of the digitization project;

        (2) Create file names and record IDs that are unique to each image file;

        (3) Embed the metadata specified by paragraph (c) of this section in each image file, capture and maintain it in a recordkeeping system, associate it with the records it describes, and keep it consistent and accurate in both places;

        (4) Ensure that scanning equipment embeds the system-generated technical metadata specified by table 4 to paragraph (e)(1) of this section for format technical metadata and table 5 to paragraph (e)(2) of this section for processing technical metadata in each image file, and ensure that image processing does not alter or delete it; and

        (5) Transfer metadata to NARA in CSV format.

        (c)  (1) Capture in a recordkeeping system and embed in each image file the following administrative metadata:

        (2) Capture in a recordkeeping system and embed in each file any of the following access and use restrictions the metadata inherited from the source records:

        (d)  Capture the following descriptive metadata from source records at the lowest level needed to support access and preservation and to maintain contextual information. Depending on the agency's existing recordkeeping practices and level of intellectual control, it may use information from the project level, record series, file unit, or item, as the source for descriptive metadata. If the components of a record have not been individually indexed with unique descriptions, apply the series or file unit-level descriptions to all of the image files within that grouping. If source records share a common material type or dimensions, auto-populate the source type and source dimension metadata. If the components of the record do not have individual titles, the agency must apply the item Record IDs instead. Capture the metadata in a recordkeeping system for each image file:

        (e)  (1) Ensure that the following values are embedded in each image file and that image processing does not delete or alter them:

        (2) Ensure that the following process metadata elements are recorded for each image file:

        (3) Capture the following technical metadata in a recordkeeping system for each image file, and use them to monitor digital records for corruption or alteration:

        § 1236.56   Validating digitized records and disposition authorities.

#### § § 1236.56

        (a) When a digitization project is complete, the agency must validate that the digitized versions meet the standards in this subpart.

        (b) Separate staff must conduct the validation, independent from the staff that performed the digitization QC inspections described in § 1236.46.

        (c) Agencies must verify that:

        (1) All records identified in the project's scope have either been digitized or have been identified in project documentation as missing or incomplete records (and the agency must note this information in the Details section of the ERA TR when transferring the records);

        (2) All required metadata are accurate, complete, and correctly labeled;

        (3) All image technical attributes specified in § 1236.50 have been met;

      § 1237.26   What materials and processes must agencies use to create audiovisual records?

#### § § 1237.26

      Agencies must:

      (a) For picture negatives and motion picture preprints (negatives, masters, and all other copies) of permanent, long-term temporary, or unscheduled records, use polyester base media and process in accordance with industry standards as specified in ISO 18906 (incorporated by reference, see § 1237.3).

      (1) Ensure that residual sodium thiosulfate (hypo) on newly processed black-and-white photographic film does not exceed 0.014 grams per square meter.

      (2) Require laboratories to process film in accordance with this standard. Process color film in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

      (3) If using reversal type processing, require full photographic reversal;  develop, bleach, expose, develop, fix, and wash.

      (b) Avoid using motion pictures in a final “A & B” format (two precisely matched reels designed to be printed together) for the reproduction of excerpts or stock footage.

      (c) Use only industrial or professional video and audio recording equipment, new and previously unrecorded magnetic tape stock and blank optical media (e.g., DVD and CD), for original copies of permanent, long-term temporary, or unscheduled recordings. Limit the use of consumer formats to distribution or reference copies or to subjects scheduled for destruction. Avoid using videocassettes in the VHS format for use as originals of permanent or unscheduled records.

      (d) Record permanent, long-term, temporary, or unscheduled audio recordings on optical media from major manufacturers. Avoid using cassettes as originals for permanent records or unscheduled records (although they may be used as reference copies).

      (e) For born-digital or scanned digital images that are scheduled as permanent or unscheduled, a record (or master) version of each image must be comparable in quality to a 35 mm film photograph or better, and must be saved in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) or JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF, JPEG). For more detailed requirements on image format and resolution, see § 1235.48(e) of this subchapter. For temporary digital photographs, agencies select formats that they deem most suitable for fulfillment of business needs.

      § 1237.28   What special concerns apply to digital photographs?

#### § § 1237.28

      Digital photographs, either originating in digital form (“born-digital”) or scanned from photographic prints, slides, and negatives, are subject to the provisions of this part and the requirements of 36 CFR part 1236, and NARA guidance for transfer of digital photographs located on the following NARA Web page— In managing digital photographs, agency and contractor personnel must:

      (a) Schedule digital photographs and related databases as soon as possible for the minimum time needed for agency business and transfer the records promptly according to the disposition instructions on their records schedule.

      (b) Select image management software and hardware tools that will meet long-term archival requirements, including transfer to the National Archives of the United States, as well as business needs. Request additional information and assistance from NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at

      (c) When developing digital image storage strategies, build redundancy into storage systems, backing up image files through on-line approaches, off-line, or combinations of the two. (See also electronic storage requirements in § 1236.28 of this subchapter).

      (d)(1) When digitizing permanent or unscheduled slides and negatives, agencies must document the quality control inspection process used during the digitization process.

      (i) Conduct a visual inspection of a sample of the scanned images to identify any defects. Additionally, evaluate the accuracy of finding aids, and verify the integrity of file header information and file names.

      (ii) The sample size must be large enough to yield statistically valid results. To determine the appropriate sample size, use one of the quality sampling methods outlined in ANSI/AIIM TR34 (incorporated by reference, see § 1237.3). Agencies may consult ISO 2859-1:1996 for further guidance (contact NARA's textual research room or NARA's Regulation Comments Desk, see § 1237.3(a), for availability).

      (2) When digitizing permanent or unscheduled photographic prints, refer to the requirements specified in part 1236 subpart E of this subchapter.

      (e) For born-digital images scheduled as permanent, long-term temporary, or unscheduled, perform periodic inspections, using sampling methods or more comprehensive verification systems (e.g., checksum programs), to evaluate image file stability, documentation quality, and finding aid reliability. Agencies must also establish procedures for refreshing digital data (recopying) and file migration, especially for images and databases retained for five years or more.

      (f) Designate a record set of images that is maintained separately from other versions. Record sets of permanent or unscheduled images that have already been compressed once (e.g., compressed TIFF or first-generation JPEG) must not be subjected to further changes in image size.

      (g) Organize record images in logical series. Group permanent digital images separately from temporary digital images.

      (h) Document information about digital photographic images as they are produced. For permanent or unscheduled images descriptive elements must include:

      (1) An identification number;

      (2) Information about image content;

      (3) Identity and organizational affiliation of the photographer;

      (4) Existence of any copyright or other potential restrictions on image use; and

      (5) Technical data including file format and version, bit depth, image size, camera make and model, compression method and level, custom or generic color profiles (ICC/ICM profile), and, where applicable, Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) information embedded in the header of image files by certain digital cameras.

      (i) Provide a unique file name to identify the digital image.

      (j) Develop finding aids sufficiently detailed to ensure efficient and accurate retrieval. Ensure that indexes, caption lists, and assignment logs can be used to identify and chronologically cut-off block of images for transfer to the NARA.

      § 1237.30   How do agencies manage records on nitrocellulose-base and cellulose-acetate base film?

#### § § 1237.30

      (a) The nitrocellulose base, a substance akin to gun cotton, is chemically unstable and highly flammable. Agencies must handle nitrocellulose-base film (used in the manufacture of sheet film, 35 mm motion pictures, aerial and still photography into the 1950s) as specified below:

      (1) Remove nitrocellulose film materials (e.g., 35mm motion picture film and large series of still pictures) from records storage areas.

      (2) Notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  (for photographs) or  (for motion picture film), about the existence of nitrocellulose film materials for a determination of whether they may be destroyed or retained after a copy is made by the agency for transfer to NARA. If NARA appraises nitrate film materials as disposable and the agency wishes to retain them, the agency must follow the standard NFPA 40-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 1237.3).

      (3) Follow the packing and shipping of nitrate film as specified in Department of Transportation regulations (49 CFR 172.101, Hazardous materials table; 172.504, Transportation; 173.24, Standard requirements for all packages; and 173.177, Motion picture film and X-ray film—nitrocellulose base).

      (b) Agencies must inspect cellulose-acetate film periodically for an acetic odor, wrinkling, or the presence of crystalline deposits on the edge or surface of the film that indicate deterioration. Notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at  (for photographs) or  (for motion picture film), immediately after inspection about deteriorating permanent or unscheduled audiovisual records composed of cellulose acetate so that they can be copied by the agency prior to transfer of the original and duplicate film to NARA.

      Subpart B—Microfilming Standards

        § 1238.10   What are the format standards for microfilming records?

#### § § 1238.10

        The following formats must be used when microfilming records:

        (a) —(1)  The formats described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used for microfilming source documents on 16mm and 35mm roll film. A reduction ratio no greater than 1:24 is recommended for correspondence or similar typewritten documents. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting image quality requirements. When microfilming on 35mm film for aperture card applications, the format dimensions in ANSI/AIIM MS32 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Table 1 must be used, and the aperture card format “D Aperture” shown in ANSI/AIIM MS41 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Figure 1, must be used. The components of the aperture card, including the paper and adhesive, must conform to the requirements of ANSI/PIMA IT9.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The 35mm film used in the aperture card application must conform to film designated as LE 500 in ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).

        (2)  Microfilm created using computer output microfilm (COM) technology must use the simplex mode described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) at an effective ratio of 1:24 or 1:48 depending upon the application.

        (b)  When creating microfiche, either by microfilming source documents or using COM technology, the formats and reduction ratios prescribed in ANSI/AIIM MS5 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used as specified for the size and quality of the documents being filmed. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for determining the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting the image quality requirements.

        (c) —(1)  When microfilming source documents, place indexes, registers, or other finding aids, if microfilmed, either in the first frames of the first roll of film or in the last frames of the last roll of film of a series. For microfiche, place the indexes in the last frames of the last microfiche or microfilm jacket of a series.

        (2)  Place indexes on COM following the data on a roll of film, in the last frames of a single microfiche, or in the last frames of the last fiche in a series. Other locations for indexes may be used only if dictated by special system constraints.

        § 1238.12   What documentation is required for microfilmed records?

#### § § 1238.12

        Agencies must ensure that the microforms capture all information contained on the source documents and that they can be used for the purposes the source documents served. Microform records must be labeled and organized to support easy retrieval and use. Agencies must:

        (a) Arrange, describe, and index the filmed records to permit retrieval of any particular document or component of the records.

        (b) Title each microform roll or fiche with a titling target or header. For fiche, place the titling information in the first frame if the information will not fit on the header. At a minimum, titling information must include:

        (1) The title of the records;

        (2) The number or identifier for each unit of microform;

        (3) The security classification, if any; and

        (4) The name of the agency and sub-organization, the inclusive dates, names, or other data identifying the records to be included on a unit of microform.

        (c) Add an identification target showing the date of microfilming. When necessary to give the microform copy legal standing, the target must also identify the person who authorized the microfilming. Use ANSI/AIIM MS19 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for standards for identification targets.

        § 1238.14   What are the microfilming requirements for permanent and unscheduled records?

#### § § 1238.14

        (a) Agencies must apply the standards in this section when microfilming:

        (1) Permanent paper records where the original paper record will be destroyed (only after authorization from NARA);

        (2) Unscheduled paper records where the original paper record will be destroyed (only after authorization from NARA); and

        (3) Permanent and unscheduled original microform records (no paper originals) produced by automation, such as COM.

        (b) Agencies must use polyester-based silver gelatin type film that conforms to ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for LE 500 film in all applications.

        (c) Agencies must process microforms so that the residual thiosulfate ion concentration will not exceed 0.014 grams per square meter in accordance with ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) and use the processing procedures in ANSI/AIIM MS1 and ANSI/AIIM MS23 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).

        (d) Agencies must use the following standards for quality:

        (1) —(i)  Agencies must determine minimum resolution on microforms of source documents using the method in the Quality Index Method for determining resolution and anticipated losses when duplicating, as described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 and ANSI/AIIM MS43 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). Agencies must perform resolution tests using an ANSI/ISO 3334 _Resolution_ Test Chart (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) or a commercially available certifiable target manufactured to comply with this standard, and read the patterns following the instructions of ANSI/ISO 3334. Agencies must use the smallest character used to display information to determine the height used in the Quality Index formula. Agencies must use a Quality Index of five at the third generation level.

        (ii)  COM must meet the requirements of ANSI/AIIM MS1 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).

        (2)  Agencies must use the background ISO standard visual diffuse transmission density on microforms appropriate to the type of documents being filmed. Agencies must use the procedure for density measurement described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The densitometer must meet with ANSI/NAPM IT2.18 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for spectral conditions and ANSI/NAPM IT2.19 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for geometric conditions for transmission density.

        (i) Recommended visual diffuse transmission background densities for images of documents are as follows:

        (ii) Recommended visual diffuse transmission densities for computer generated images are as follows:

        (3)  The base plus fog density of unexposed, processed microfilms must not exceed 0.10. When a tinted base film is used, the density will be increased. The difference must be added to the values given in the tables in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (4)  Due to optical limitations in most micrographic systems, microfilm images of thin lines appearing in the source documents will tend to fill in as a function of their width and density. Therefore, as the reduction ratio of a given system is increased, reduce the background density as needed to ensure that the copies will be legible.

        § 1238.16   What are the microfilming requirements for temporary records, duplicates, and user copies?

#### § § 1238.16

        (a)  Agencies must use the microfilming requirements in § 1238.14.

        (b)  NARA does not require the use of specific standards for these microforms. Agencies may select a film stock that meets their needs and ensures the preservation of the microforms for their full retention period. NARA recommends that agencies consult appropriate standards, available as noted in § 1238.3, and manufacturer's instructions for processing production, and maintenance of microform to ensure that the images are accessible and usable for the entire retention period of the records.

      Subpart C—Storage, Use, and Disposition of Microform Records

        § 1238.20   How must microform records be stored?

#### § § 1238.20

        (a)  Agencies must store permanent and unscheduled microform records under the extended term storage conditions specified in ISO 18911 and ANSI/PIMA IT9.2 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), except that the relative humidity of the storage area must be a constant 35 percent RH, plus or minus 5 percent. Non-silver copies of microforms must be maintained in a different storage area than are silver gelatin originals or duplicate copies).

        (b)  Agencies must store temporary microform records under conditions that will ensure their preservation for their authorized retention period. NARA suggests that agencies may consult Life Expectance (LE) guidelines in ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).

        § 1238.22   What are the inspection requirements for permanent and unscheduled microform records?

#### § § 1238.22

        (a) Agencies must inspect, or arrange for a contractor or NARA to inspect master microform of permanent or unscheduled records following the inspection requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) The microforms listed in paragraph (a) of this section must be inspected initially in accordance with ANSI/AIIM MS45 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). All microforms must be inspected when they are two years old. After the initial two-year inspection, unless there is a catastrophic event, the microforms must be inspected as follows until they are transferred to NARA:

        (1) For microfilm produced after 1990, inspect the microfilm every 5 years.

        (2) For microfilm produced prior to 1990, inspect the microfilm every 2 years.

        (c) To facilitate inspection, the agency must maintain an inventory that lists each microform series or publication by production date, producer, processor, format, and results of previous inspections.

        (d) The inspection must include the following elements:

        (1) An inspection for aging blemishes following ANSI/AIIM MS45 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5);

        (2) A rereading of resolution targets;

        (3) A remeasurement of density; and

        (4) A certification of the environmental conditions under which the microforms are stored, as specified in § 1238.20(a).

        (e) The agency must prepare an inspection report, and send a copy to NARA in accordance with § 1238.28(c). The inspection report must contain:

        (1) A summary of the inspection findings, including:

        (i) A list of batches by year that includes the identification numbers of microfilm rolls and microfiche in each batch;

        (ii) The quantity of microforms inspected;

        (i) A complete description of all records inspected (title; roll or fiche number or other unique identifier for each unit of film inspected; security classification, if any; and inclusive dates, names, or other data identifying the records on the unit of film);

        (ii) The date of inspection;

        (iii) The elements of inspection (see paragraph (d) of this section);

        (iv) Any defects uncovered; and

        (v) The corrective action taken.

        (f) If an inspection finds that a master microform is deteriorating, the agency must make a silver duplicate in accordance with § 1238.14 to replace the deteriorating master. The duplicate microform must meet inspection requirements (see § 1238.22) before it may be transferred to a record center or NARA.

        (g) Inspections must be conducted in environmentally controlled areas in accordance with ANSI/AIIM MS45 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).

        § 1238.24   What are NARA inspection requirements for temporary microform records?

#### § § 1238.24

        NARA recommends, but does not require, that agencies use the inspection procedures described in § 1238.22(a).

        § 1238.26   What are the restrictions on use for permanent and unscheduled microform records?

#### § § 1238.26

        (a) Agencies must not use the silver gelatin master microform or duplicate silver gelatin microform of permanent or unscheduled records created in accordance with § 1238.14 of this part for reference purposes. Agencies must ensure that the master microform remains clean and undamaged during the process of making a duplicating master.

        (b) Agencies must use duplicates for:

        (1) Reference;

        (2) Further duplication on a recurring basis;

        (3) Large-scale duplication; and

        (4) Distribution of records on microform.

        (c) Agencies retaining the original record in accordance with an approved records disposition schedule may apply agency standards for the use of microform records.

        § 1238.28   What must agencies do when sending permanent microform records to a records storage facility?

#### § § 1238.28

        Agencies must:

        (a) Follow the procedures in part 1232 of this chapter and the additional requirements in this section.

        (b) Package non-silver copies separately from the silver gelatin original or silver duplicate microform copy and clearly label them as non-silver copies.

        (c) Include the following information on the transmittal (SF 135 for NARA Federal Records Centers), or in an attachment to the transmittal. For records sent to an agency records center or commercial records storage facility, submit this information to NARA as part of the documentation required by § 1232.14 of this subchapter:

        (1) Name of the agency and program component;

        (7) The inspection log forms and inspection reports required by § 1238.22(e).

        (d) Agencies may transfer permanent microform records to a records storage facility meeting the storage requirements in § 1232.14(a) (see § 1233.10 of this subchapter for NARA Federal Records Centers) of this subchapter only after the first inspection or with certification that the microforms will be inspected by the agency, a contractor, or a NARA Federal Records Center (on a reimbursable basis) when the microforms become 2 years old.

        § 1238.30   What must agencies do when transferring permanent microform records to the National Archives of the United States?

#### § § 1238.30

        Agencies must:

        (a) Follow the procedures in part 1235 of this subchapter and the additional requirements in this section.

        (b) If the records are not in a NARA Federal Records Center, submit the information specified in § 1232.14(c) of this subchapter.

        (c) Transfer the silver gelatin original (or duplicate silver gelatin microform created in accordance with § 1238.14) plus one microform copy.

        (d) Ensure that the inspections of the microforms are up-to-date. NARA will not accession permanent microform records until the first inspection has been performed (when the microforms are 2 years old).

        (e) Package non-silver copies separately from the silver gelatin original or silver duplicate microform copy and clearly label them as non-silver copies.

        § 1238.32   Do agencies need to request NARA approval for the disposition of all microform and source records?

#### § § 1238.32

        (a)  Agencies must schedule both source documents (originals) and microforms. NARA must approve the schedule, SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, in accordance with part 1225 of this subchapter before any records, including source documents, may be destroyed.

        (1) Agencies that comply with the standards in § 1238.14 must include on the SF 115 the following certification: “This certifies that the records described on this form were (or will be) microfilmed in accordance with the standards set forth in 36 CFR part 1238.”

        (2) Agencies using microfilming methods, materials, and procedures that do not meet the standards in § 1238.14(a) must include on the SF 115 a description of the system and standards used.

        NARA may undertake an inspection when an agency fails to address specific records management problems involving high risk to significant records. Problems may be identified through a risk assessment or through other means, such as reports in the media, Congressional inquiries, allegations of unauthorized destruction, reports issued by the GAO or an agency's Inspector General, or observations by NARA staff members. Inspections will be undertaken when other NARA program assistance efforts (see § 1239.10) have failed to mitigate situations where there is a high risk of loss of significant records, or when NARA agrees to a request from the agency head that NARA conduct an inspection to address specific significant records management issues in the agency. NARA reports to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget on inspections in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2904.

        § 1239.22   How does NARA notify the agency of the inspection?

#### § § 1239.22

        (a) Once NARA identifies the need to conduct an agency inspection, the Archivist of the United States sends a letter to the head of the agency. If the agency being inspected is a component of a cabinet department, the letter will be addressed to the head of the component, with a copy sent to the head of the department. NARA will also send copies to the agency's records officer. The letter will include:

        (1) Notification that NARA intends to conduct an inspection, the records that will be inspected, and the issues to be addressed;

        (2) A beginning date for the inspection that is no more than 30 days after the date of the letter; and

        (3) A request that the agency appoint a point of contact who will assist NARA in conducting the inspection.

        (b) If the agency does not respond to NARA's notification letter, NARA will use its statutory authority under 44 U.S.C. 2904(c)(8) to report the matter to the agency's congressional oversight committee and to the Office of Management and Budget.

        § 1239.24   How does NARA conduct an inspection?

#### § § 1239.24

        (a) The NARA inspection team leader will coordinate with the agency point of contact to arrange an initial meeting with the agency. The initial meeting will address such matters as the parameters of the inspection, any surveys or other inspection instruments, the offices to be visited, and the timing of site visits.

        (b) After the inspection is complete, NARA will prepare a draft inspection report and transmit it to the agency within 45 calendar days of the last site visit. The report will include:

        (1) An executive summary;

        (2) Background and purpose of inspection;

        (3) Inspection methodology, including offices visited;

        (4) Findings;

        (5) Corrective actions needed and other recommendations; and

        (6) Any necessary appendixes, such as summaries of each site visit or the inspection instrument.

        (c) The draft report is sent to the agency for review, with a response deadline of 45 days.

        (d) NARA will incorporate any necessary corrections or revisions in the final report and issue the report to the head of the agency within 45 days.

        § 1239.26   What are an agency's follow up obligations for an inspection report?

#### § § 1239.26

        The agency must submit a plan of corrective action that specifies how the agency will address each inspection report recommendation, including a timeline for completion, and proposed progress reporting dates. The agency must submit the plan of corrective action to NARA within 60 days of transmission of the final report. NARA may take up to 60 days to review and comment on the plan. Once the plan is agreed upon by both sides, agencies must submit progress reports to NARA until all actions are completed.

      Subpart A—General Information About Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests

        § 1250.1   Scope of this part.

#### § § 1250.1

        This part implements the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, for NARA operational records and archival records that are subject to FOIA. This part contains the rules that we follow to process FOIA requests, such as the amount of time we have to make a determination regarding the release of records and what fees we may charge. Other NARA regulations in 36 CFR parts 1254 through 1275 provide detailed guidance for conducting research at NARA.

        § 1250.2   Presumption of Openness and Proactive Disclosures.

#### § § 1250.2

        NARA, consistent with its core mission, has always been committed to providing public access to as many of our records as possible. We therefore continue to affirmatively release and post records, or descriptions of such records, on our Web site at  in the absence of any FOIA request. We proactively identify and make discretionary disclosures of additional records of interest to the public whenever possible.

        § 1250.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1250.3

        The following definitions apply to this part:

        (a)  means permanently valuable records of the United States Government that have been transferred to the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States. These are historical documents and do not include NARA operational records as defined in paragraph (l) of this section.

        (b)  means a request that asks for information for a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest of the requester or the person or entity on whose behalf the request is made.

        (c)  means records provided by a submitter that may contain trade secrets or confidential business or financial information that is exempt from release under the FOIA because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause the submitter substantial competitive harm.

        (d)  means a request made by a school, university, or other educational institution that operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scholarly research, not for a commercial use.

        (e)  means the process set forth in the FOIA that allows requesters to ask for faster processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a specific compelling need.

        (f)  means one of the four categories set forth in the FOIA to determine whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: Commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions; news media requesters; and all other requesters.

        (g)  means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester is able to demonstrate that certain standards set forth in the FOIA are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.

        (h)  means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.

        (i)  means a written request, that cites the Freedom of Information Act, for access to NARA operational records, records of the executive branch of the Federal Government held by NARA, or Presidential or Vice Presidential records in NARA's custody that were created after January 19, 1981.

        (j)  means the law codified at 5 U.S.C. 552 that provides the public with the right to request Government records from Federal executive branch agencies.

        (k)  means a request submitted by an institution that is not operated on a basis that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of any person or organization, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research.

        (l)  means records that NARA creates or receives in carrying out our mission and responsibilities as an executive branch agency. This does not include archival records as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (m)  means the authority to classify information as National Security Information at creation, as granted by the President of the United States in Executive Order 13526, section 1.3, and defined in 32 CFR part 2001.

        (n)  means a request submitted by any individual whose request does not qualify as a commercial-use request, representative of the news media request (including a request made by a freelance journalist), or an educational or non-commercial scientific institution request.

        (o)  means the official Presidential and Vice _Presidential records_ created or received by the President, the Vice President, or the White House staff since January 20, 1981, and covered under the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207. Presidential Executive orders also apply to these records.

        (p)  (PRA) means the law that, in part, governs access to Presidential and Vice Presidential records and is codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 and Part 1270 of these regulations. The PRA contains six restrictions that authorize NARA to withhold information, which apply for 12 years after a President leaves office. Four of the PRA restrictions are identical to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Two relate to appointments to Federal office and confidential communications requesting or submitting advice between the President and his advisers, or between and among such advisers. The PRA also excludes application of FOIA Exemption 5.

        (q)  means a person or entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public, and that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals, including print and online publications that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. We consider requests for records that support the news-dissemination function of the requester to be a non-commercial use. We consider “freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity as working for that entity. A publishing contract provides the clearest evidence that a journalist expects publication; however, we also consider a requester's past publication record. We decide whether to grant a requester media status on a case-by-case basis, based on the requester's intended use.

        (r)  means examining documents responsive to a request to determine whether any portions of them are exempt from disclosure. _Review_ time includes processing any record for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure), including redacting the record and marking the appropriate FOIA exemptions.

        (s)  means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.

        (t)  means any person or entity providing potentially confidential commercial information to an agency, which information may be subject to a FOIA request. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, individuals, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.

        § 1250.4   Who can file a FOIA request?

#### § § 1250.4

        Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a Federal agency, regardless of nationality, may file a FOIA request with NARA. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551(2), excludes Federal agencies from filing FOIA requests. However, state and local governments may file FOIA requests.

        § 1250.6   Does the FOIA apply to all of the records at NARA?

#### § § 1250.6

        No, the FOIA applies only to the records of the executive branch of the Federal Government and certain Presidential and Vice Presidential records:

        § 1250.8   Does NARA provide access under FOIA to all the executive branch records housed at NARA facilities?

#### § § 1250.8

        (a) NARA provides access under FOIA to the records NARA creates ( records) and records originating in the executive branch that have been transferred to the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States ( records). The NARA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent unit within NARA that controls access under FOIA to the _operational_ records that OIG creates. NARA OIG handles FOIA requests it receives separately and independently from FOIA requests to NARA.

        (b) NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), located in St. Louis, Missouri, is the repository for twentieth- and twenty-first-century personnel and medical records of former members of the military and personnel records of former civilian employees of the Federal Government.

        (1) Those official personnel and medical files that have been transferred to NARA's legal custody are processed by NARA according to this part, at §§ 1250.20 through 1250.32.

        (2) Those personnel and medical records that remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them are governed by the FOIA and other access regulations of the originating agencies, which the NPRC processes under authority delegated by the originating agencies, not under the provisions of this part. Because of the intricacies of other agencies' FOIA regulations, further explanation here is not feasible. More information about the NPRC processes, including access to NPRC records, is available on NARA's Web site at  and at

        (c) NARA's Federal records centers store records that agencies no longer need for day-to-day business. These records remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them. Requests for access to another agency's records in a NARA Federal records center should be made directly to the originating agency. We do not process FOIA requests for these records.

        (d) If your FOIA request includes a record in the legal custody of an originating agency, we forward that request to the originating agency for processing. We also provide you with notification that we have done so and with contact information for the originating agency. (See 36 CFR 1256.2 for more information about how to access records that are stored in Federal records centers.)

        § 1250.10   Do I need to use FOIA to gain access to records at NARA?

#### § § 1250.10

        (a) Most  records held by NARA have no restrictions to access and are available to the public for research without filing a FOIA request. You may either visit a NARA facility as a researcher to view and copy records or you may write to request copies of specific records. (See subpart B of 36 CFR part 1256 for more information about how to access _archival_ records).

        (b) If you are seeking access to  records that are not yet available to the public, you need to file a FOIA request. (See 36 CFR 1256.22 for information on how to request access to restricted _archival_ records. See paragraph (d) of this section, and part 1260, for additional procedures on access to classified records.)

        (c) You must also file a FOIA request when you request access to NARA  records (records NARA creates) that are not already available to the public.

        (d) If you are requesting records that you know are classified to protect national security interests, you may wish to use the Mandatory Declassification Review process, which is set forth at 36 CFR 1260.70. (Please see NARA's FOIA Guide, available online at  for the differences between the FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review access processes.)

        § 1250.12   What types of records are available in NARA's FOIA library?

#### § § 1250.12

        (a) We make available certain materials (listed in the FOIA) for public inspection and copying in both our physical FOIA Library as well as on NARA's Web site, available at

        (b) The materials provided through NARA's FOIA Library include:

        (1) Final NARA orders;

        (2) Written statements of NARA policy which are not published in the ;

        (3) Operational staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect members of the public;

        (4) At our discretion, copies of operational records requested three or more times under FOIA and other records that have been, or are likely to become, the subject of subsequent FOIA requests for substantially the same records;

        (5) An index, updated quarterly, to these materials; and

        (6) FOIA logs including opening and closing date, requester's and organization's name, description of the records, and final disposition.

        (c) You may inspect and copy these materials during normal working hours at the NARA facility where the records are located. See 36 CFR part 1253 and NARA's Web site at  for locations and research room procedures.

        (d) You may also access much of these materials on the NARA Web site. Any of these materials created after October 31, 1996, are on NARA's Web site at

        (e) For a paper copy of the index to these online materials, write to: NARA FOIA Officer (NGC); Room 3110; National Archives and Records Administration; 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.

        § 1250.14   Preservation of FOIA-related records.

#### § § 1250.14

        Each NARA component preserves all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this part, as well as copies of all requested records, until Title 44 of the United States Code or NARA's General Records Schedule 4.2 authorizes disposition or destruction. Records will not be disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.

      Subpart B—How To Request Records Under FOIA

        § 1250.20   What do I include in my FOIA request?

#### § § 1250.20

        In your FOIA request, which must be submitted in writing:

        (a) Describe the records you seek in sufficient detail to enable NARA staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. The more information you provide, the better possibility NARA has of finding the records you are seeking. Information that will help NARA find the records includes:

        (1) The agencies, offices, or individuals involved;

        (2) The approximate date(s) when the records were created;

        (3) The subject, title, or description of the records sought; and

        (4) Author, recipient, case number, file designation, or reference number.

        (b) Include your name and full mailing address as well as phone number and email address. This information allows us to reach you faster if we have any questions about your request. It is your responsibility to keep your current mailing address up to date with the office where you have filed the FOIA request.

        (c) If you request records about yourself, you must do so in accordance with the Privacy Act and our implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 1202. This includes requirements to verify your identity (see 36 CFR 1202.40). If you request records about someone other than yourself, you may receive greater access if you submit either a notarized document signed by the other person that certifies their identity and gives their permission for you to have access, or proof that the other person is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). NARA may, at its discretion, require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure of records about them.

        (d) Mark both your letter and envelope, or the subject line of your email, with the words “FOIA Request.”

        (e) Before filing your request, you may find it helpful to consult NARA's “Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide”—which is available electronically at  and in paper form. For a paper copy of NARA's FOIA Guide, write to: NARA FOIA Officer (NGC); Room 3110; National Archives and Records Administration; 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. For additional information about the FOIA, you may refer directly to the statute at 5 U.S.C. 552 or visit

> [79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]

        § 1250.22   Where do I send my FOIA request?

#### § § 1250.22

        (a) NARA has several FOIA Customer Service Centers that process FOIA requests. You should send your FOIA request to the appropriate FOIA Customer Service Center that you believe would have the records you seek:

        (b) NARA officially receives your request when it reaches the proper office's FOIA staff, but no later than 10 working days after the request first arrives at one of the offices in the table above. Receipt by the appropriate office initiates the time period for responding to your request (see 36 CFR 1250.26).

        (c) If you have questions concerning the processing of your FOIA request, you may contact the designated FOIA Customer Service Center for the facility processing your request. If that initial contact does not resolve your concerns, you may wish to contact the designated FOIA Public Liaison for the facility processing your request. You can find a list of NARA's FOIA Customer Service Centers and Public Liaisons at

> [79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]

        § 1250.24   Does NARA accept electronic FOIA requests?

#### § § 1250.24

        Yes. You may submit and track requests for NARA  records through the  program, accessible at  or by sending an email to  The body of the message must contain all of the information listed in 36 CFR 1250.20. You may also file a FOIA request by emailing your request to the offices listed in the table at 36 CFR 1250.22.

        § 1250.26   How does NARA process my FOIA request?

#### § § 1250.26

        (a)  NARA acknowledges all FOIA requests in writing within 20 working days after receipt by the appropriate office (see 36 CFR 1250.22). The acknowledgement letter or email informs you of your request tracking number, and any complexity in processing that may lengthen the time NARA requires to reach a final decision on the release of the records. The acknowledgement letter or email may also seek additional information to clarify your request or to ask you to narrow the scope of a very large or broad request.

        (b)  Requests must reasonably describe the records sought. If we determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, or if we are uncertain about another aspect of the request, we contact you to ask for clarification.

        (c)  As the end or cut-off date for a records search, NARA uses the date on which we first begin our search for documents responsive to your request, unless you specify an earlier cut-off date. This includes those cases when you request records “through the present,” “through today,” or similar language. If NARA uses any other search end date, we inform you of that date.

        (d)  NARA may stop the clock for processing a request one time in order to seek your clarification. In such a case, the processing time resumes upon our receipt of your response. We provide at least 60 calendar days for you to respond to a request for clarification. If you do not clarify the request within 60 calendar days, we deny the request for not reasonably describing the records sought and provide you with the opportunity to appeal under the procedures in Subpart D. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, NARA reserves the right to administratively close the FOIA request 60 calendar days after the date of the last correspondence we send.

        (e)  If you have requested records containing confidential commercial information, refer to 36 CFR 1250.82 for information on how we process that request.

        (f)  NARA places FOIA requests in simple or complex processing queues to be processed in the order received, on a first-in, first-out basis. In most cases, we make a determination about release of the records you requested within 20 working days from when the appropriate office receives your request (simple queue processing). However, if complexity or unusual circumstances prevent NARA from making a decision within 20 working days, we place your request into a complex processing queue. This way, such cases do not hold up the processing of other requests that do not include such time-consuming factors. We notify you of complicating factors in our acknowledgement letter or email, and you may choose to limit the scope of your request to convert the complex processing queue request to a simple processing queue request. For more detailed information on NARA's multi-track processing queues, see our FOIA Guide at  (for a paper copy, see 36 CFR 1250.20(d)).

        (g)  We place into a complex processing queue any request that cannot be completed within 20 working days due to complexity, volume, because it contains national security information, because it involves Presidential or Vice Presidential records, or involves unusual circumstances. Unusual circumstances include the need to:

        (1) Search for and collect the records from one or more field facilities;

        (2) Search for, collect, and review a voluminous amount of records that are part of a single request;

        (3) Consult with another Federal agency before releasing records; or

        (4) Refer records to another Federal agency for declassification.

        (h)  If NARA needs to extend the deadline for more than an additional 10 working days due to the complexity of a request or as a result of unusual circumstances, we ask if you wish to modify your request so that we can answer the request sooner. If you do not wish to modify your request, we work with you to arrange an alternative schedule for review and release. We will also notify you that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is available to provide dispute resolution services, and how to contact them.

        (i)  NARA does not have the authority to declassify and release records containing national security information without the approval of the agencies that have Original Classification Authority for the information contained in the records. We send copies of the documents to the appropriate originating Federal agencies for declassification review. We also send you an initial response to your FOIA request within 20 working days, informing you of this consultation with, or referral to, another Federal agency, except to the extent that the association with the other agency may itself be classified. Upon your request, we provide you an estimated date of completion.

        (j)  If you request Presidential or Vice Presidential records and we determine that the records are not subject to any applicable FOIA or Presidential Records Act (PRA) exemption (and can therefore be released), we must notify the current and former President(s) or Vice President(s) of our intention to disclose information from those records. After receiving the notice, the current and former President(s) and Vice President(s) have a period of time (as set out in the applicable Executive order on implementation of the PRA) in which to choose whether to invoke Executive Privilege to deny access to the requested information. Although we send you an initial status response to your FOIA request within 20 working days in these cases, the final response to your FOIA request will take longer. We can provide the final response only at the end of the Presidential notification period set forth in the Executive order.

> [79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]

        § 1250.27   How does NARA determine estimated completion dates for FOIA requests?

#### § § 1250.27

        (a) When you ask for an estimated completion date for records that do not require consultation with another agency, we estimate the completion date on the basis of our reasonable judgment at that point as to how long it will take to complete the request. Given the uncertainty inherent in establishing any estimate, the estimated completion date may be subject to change at any time.

        (b) When you ask for an estimated completion date for records that must be reviewed by another agency, our estimate is also based on information from the other agency:

        (1) When we send documents for consultation to another agency, we ask the agency to provide an estimated completion date for its portion of the processing.

        (2) We keep the consulting agency's estimated completion date for its portion of the processing in the request file and use it in addition to our own processing time estimate to provide you with an overall estimated completion date.

        (3) If the consulted agency or agencies do not provide us with an estimated completion date, we provide you with an estimate based on our general experience working with the agency or agencies and the types and volumes of records at issue.

        § 1250.28   How do I request expedited processing?

#### § § 1250.28

        (a) NARA processes requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever we determine that one or more of the following criteria exist:

        (1) A reasonable expectation of an imminent threat to an individual's life or physical safety;

        (2) A reasonable expectation of an imminent loss of a substantial due process right;

        (3) An urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (this criterion applies only to those requests made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public); or

        (4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions that affect public confidence in the Government's integrity.

        (b) NARA can expedite requests, or segments of requests, only for records over which we have control. If NARA must refer a request to another agency, we will inform you and suggest that you seek expedited review from that agency. NARA cannot expedite the review of classified records nor can we shorten the Presidential notification period described in 36 CFR 1250.26(j).

        (c) To request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining the basis for your need for expedited processing. You must send the request to the appropriate official at the address listed in § 1250.22 of this subpart. You may request expedited processing when you first request records or at any time during NARA's processing of your request or appeal.

        (d) We will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of our receipt of your request to expedite. If we grant your request, the NARA office responsible for the review of the requested records will process your request as a priority, and it will be processed as soon as practicable. We will inform you if we deny your request for expedited processing. If you decide to appeal that denial, we will expedite our review of your appeal.

        § 1250.30   How does NARA respond to my request?

#### § § 1250.30

        (a) NARA sends you a response informing you of our release determination, including whether any responsive records were located, how much responsive material was located, whether the records have been released in full or withheld in full or in part, where you may review the records, and any fees you must pay for the request. We will use plain language in all written communications with requesters.

        (b) If we deny any part of your request, our response will explain the reasons for the denial, which FOIA exemptions apply to withhold records, your right to appeal that determination, and your right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS.

        (c) NARA may withhold records in full or in part if any of the nine FOIA exemptions apply. NARA withholds information only where disclosure is prohibited by law (such as information that remains classified, or information that is specifically exempt by statute) or where we reasonably foresee that disclosure would cause harm to an interest protected by one of the FOIA exemptions. If we must withhold part of a record, we provide access to the rest of the information in the record. On the released portion of the record, we indicate the amount of information we redacted and the exemption(s) we applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest the exemption protects. NARA may also determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format you sought. Information that may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA is:

        (d) If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, we provide you with interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.

        (e) NARA may not withhold Presidential records subject to FOIA under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) as defined in the table in paragraph (c) of this section. However, NARA may withhold Presidential records under the remaining FOIA exemptions. In addition, Presidential records may be withheld under the six PRA restrictions for a period of 12 years from when a President leaves office, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2204 and 36 CFR part 1270. Representatives of the current and former Presidents may also review Presidential records, and may assert constitutionally-based privileges that would prevent NARA from releasing some or all or the information requested.

        § 1250.32   How may I request assistance with the FOIA process?

#### § § 1250.32

        (a) For assistance at any point in the FOIA process, you may contact the NARA FOIA Public Liaison. That individual is responsible for assisting you to reduce delays, increase transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and resolve any FOIA disputes. You can find a list of our FOIA Public Liaisons at

        (b) The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), part of NARA, serves as the Federal FOIA Ombudsman and assists requesters and agencies to prevent and resolve FOIA disputes. OGIS also reviews agencies' FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. You may contact OGIS using the information provided below in 36 CFR 1250.74(c).

        § 1250.38   In what format does NARA provide copies?

#### § § 1250.38

        After all applicable fees are paid, we provide you copies of records in the format you request if the records already exist in that format, or if they are readily reproducible in the format you request.

      Subpart C—Fees

        § 1250.50   General information on fees for all FOIA requests.

#### § § 1250.50

        (a) If you have failed to pay FOIA fees in the past, we will require you to pay your past-due bill and we may also require that you pay the anticipated fee before we begin processing your current request. If we estimate that your fees may be greater than $250, we may also require advance payment or a deposit before we begin processing your request. If you fail to make an advance payment within 60 calendar days after the date of NARA's fee letter, we will close the request.

        (b) If we determine that you (acting either alone or with other requesters) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reduce fees, we may aggregate all of these requests when calculating the fees. In aggregating requests, we may consider the subject matter of the requests and whether the requests were filed close in time to one another.

        (c) If, in the course of negotiating fees, you do not respond to a NARA component within 60 calendar days, we reserve the right to administratively close the FOIA request after 60 calendar days have passed from the date of our last correspondence to you.

        § 1250.51   What fee policies apply to archival records?

#### § § 1250.51

        (a) NARA is specifically authorized to charge fees for copying archival records under a separate fee statute, 44 U.S.C. 2116(c). As a result, archival records are exempt from the FOIA fee waiver provisions, per 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi), and we do not grant fee waivers for archival records requested under the FOIA. However, we make most of our archival records available for examination at the NARA facility where the records are located. Whenever this is possible, you may review the records in a NARA research room at that facility free of charge and may also use your own equipment to make copies.

        (b) We do not charge search fees for FOIA requests for archival records, but we do limit the search to two hours.

        (c) If you would like us to make copies of archival records, we typically require you to pay all applicable fees (in accordance with the fee schedule) before we provide the copies.

        (d) You can find our Fee Schedule for archival records at:

        § 1250.52   What fee policies apply to operational records?

#### § § 1250.52

        (a) For operational records, we may charge search fees even if the records are not releasable or we do not find any responsive records during our search.

        (b) If you are a noncommercial FOIA requester entitled to receive 100 free pages, but the records cannot be copied onto standard-sized (8.5″ by 11″) photocopy paper, we copy them on larger paper and reduce the copy fee by the normal charge for 100 standard-sized photocopies. If the records are not on textual media (e.g., they are photographs or electronic files), we provide the equivalent of 100 pages of standard-sized paper copies for free.

        (c) We do not charge you any fee if the total cost for processing your request is $25 or less.

        (d) If estimated search or review fees exceed $50, we will contact you. If you have specified a different limit that you are willing to spend, we will contact you only if we estimate the fees will exceed that specified amount.

        § 1250.53   What is the FOIA fee schedule for operational records?

#### § § 1250.53

        In responding to FOIA requests for operational records, NARA charges the following fees, where applicable, unless we have given you a reduction or waiver of fees under § 1250.56.

        (a) —(1)  When the search is relatively straightforward and can be performed by a clerical or administrative employee, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and must be done by a NARA professional employee, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).

        (2)  NARA bases the fees for computer searches on the actual cost to NARA of operating the computer and the salary of the operator. When the search is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can conduct it, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must perform it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).

        (b)  (1) NARA charges review fees for time we spend examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. NARA charges review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a record.

        (2) The review fee is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).

        (3) NARA does not charge review fees for time we spend resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However, NARA does charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter.

        (c) —(1)  At NARA facilities with self-service photocopiers, you may make reproductions of released paper records for $0.25 per page.

        (2)  When we make the photocopies for operational records, the charge is $0.30 per page.

        (3)  NARA charges you for our direct costs for staff time for programming, computer operations, and printouts or electromagnetic media to reproduce the requested electronic information. When the work is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can perform it, the rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must do it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).

        (4)  This is the direct cost to NARA of the reproduction. We provide specific rates on a case-by-case basis.

        § 1250.54   How does NARA calculate FOIA fees for operational records?

#### § § 1250.54

        (a) If you are a commercial use requester, NARA charges you fees for searching, reviewing, and copying responsive records.

        (b) If you are an educational or scientific institution requester, or a member of the news media, you are entitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA charges copying fees only beyond the first 100 pages.

        (c) If you do not fall into either of the categories in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and are an “other requester,” you are entitled to two hours of search and review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA may charge for search time beyond the first two hours and for copying beyond the first 100 pages.

        (d) NARA does not charge a fee for processing a FOIA request if it exceeds any time limit under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in processing that request, unless unusual or exceptional circumstances (defined under the FOIA statute) are relevant.

        § 1250.56   How may I request a fee waiver for operational records?

#### § § 1250.56

        (a) We waive or reduce your fees for NARA operational records only if your request meets  of the following criteria:

        (1) The request is in the public interest ( the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government); and

        (2) The request is not primarily in your commercial interest.

        (b) To be eligible for a fee waiver or reduction you must explain:

        (1) How the records you are requesting pertain to the operations and activities of the Federal Government. There must be a clear connection between the identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government and the subject of your request;

        (2) How the release will reveal meaningful information that the public does not already know about Federal Government activities. Disclosing information that is already in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially-identical form, does not add anything new to the public's understanding of Government activities;

        (3) How disclosure to you will advance public understanding of the issue;

        (4) Your expertise or understanding of the requested records as well as your ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public. NARA ordinarily presumes that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration;

        (5) How you intend to disseminate the requested information to a broad spectrum of the public; and

        (6) How disclosure will lead to a significantly greater understanding of the Government by the public.

        (c) After reviewing your request and determining that there is a substantial public interest in release, we also determine if the request primarily furthers your commercial interests. If it does, you are not eligible for a fee waiver.

        (d) You should ask for waiver or reduction of fees when you first submit your request to NARA, and should address the criteria referenced above. You may also ask for a fee waiver at a later time while the underlying record request is still pending or during an administrative appeal.

        (e) We may also waive (either partially or in full) or reduce fees for operational records in additional circumstances as a matter of administrative discretion.

      Subpart D—Appeals

        § 1250.70   When may I appeal NARA's FOIA determination?

#### § § 1250.70

        You may appeal when there is any adverse determination, including:

        (a) Refusal to release a record, either in whole or in part;

        (b) Determination that a record does not exist or cannot be found;

        (c) Determination that the record you sought was not subject to the FOIA;

        (d) Denial of a request for expedited processing;

        (e) Denial of a fee waiver request; or

        (f) Fee category determination.

        § 1250.72   How do I file an appeal?

#### § § 1250.72

        (a) You may submit your appeal via mail or electronically. All appeals must be in writing and received by NARA within 90 calendar days from the date of our determination letter.

        (1) For appeals submitted via mail, you should mark both your letter and envelope with the words “FOIA Appeal,” and include either your tracking number or a copy of your initial request and our determination letter.

        (i) If NARA's Inspector General denied your request, send your appeal to the Archivist of the United States; (ATTN: FOIA Appeal Staff); Room 4200, National Archives and Records Administration; 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.

        (ii) Send all other appeals for denial of access to Federal records to the Deputy Archivist of the United States; (ATTN: FOIA Appeal Staff); Room 4200; National Archives and Records Administration; 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.

        (iii) For Presidential records, send appeals to the appropriate Presidential library director at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.3.

        (2) For all appeals submitted electronically, except those regarding Presidential records, send an email to  For Presidential records, electronic appeals must contain all the information listed in § 1250.72 and be sent to the email address of the appropriate Presidential library. These email addresses are listed in 36 CFR 1253.3. The subject line of the email should read “PRA/FOIA appeal.”

        (b) In your appeal correspondence, clearly identify NARA's initial determination letter (including the assigned request number, if known) from which you are appealing. Please explain why you believe our response does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, including why we should release the records, grant your fee waiver request, or expedite the processing of your request. If we were not able to find the records you wanted, explain why you believe NARA's search was inadequate. If we denied you access to records and told you that those records were not subject to FOIA, please explain why you believe the records are subject to FOIA.

        § 1250.74   How does NARA process appeals?

#### § § 1250.74

        (a) We respond to your appeal within 20 working days after the appeal official designated in 36 CFR 1250.72(a)(1)(i) and (ii) receives it. NARA has adopted the practice of generally handling backlogged appeals on a first-in, first-out basis.

        (1) An adverse determination by the Archivist or Deputy Archivist will be the final action by NARA; and

        (2) In the event you decide to file a FOIA lawsuit, NARA will administratively close your request.

        (b) We notify you of your right to seek judicial review of an adverse determination as set forth in the FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). If you wish to seek judicial review of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it administratively under this section.

        (c) We also inform you that OGIS offers dispute resolution services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If we agree to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, we will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute. You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:

      Subpart E—Confidential Commercial Information

        § 1250.80   How does a submitter identify records containing confidential commercial information?

#### § § 1250.80

        At the time of submission, a submitter of business information is expected to designate, by appropriate markings, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. Although these portions may be designated, this does not preclude NARA from conducting a full FOIA review of all such documents if a FOIA request for those records has been received. These designations will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period, or NARA extends the designation period at its discretion.

        § 1250.82   How does NARA process FOIA requests for confidential commercial information?

#### § § 1250.82

        If NARA receives a FOIA request for records containing confidential commercial information or for records that we believe may contain confidential commercial information, we follow these procedures:

        (a) If the records are less than 10 years old or are still covered under an extended FOIA Exemption 4 designation period, we review the records in response to a FOIA request. If we then believe that we should release the records under FOIA, we make reasonable efforts to inform the submitter. The notice to the submitter describes the business information requested or includes copies of the requested records. NARA does not notify the submitter when we determine that:

        (1) We must withhold the information under FOIA's exemptions;

        (2) The information has been lawfully published or made available to the public; or

        (3) We are required by a statute (other than the FOIA), or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600, to disclose the information.

        (b) If the records are 10 or more years old, we review the records in response to a FOIA request as we would any other records, and at our discretion, inform the submitter. NARA releases the records if we determine that neither Exemption 4 nor any other exemption applies.

        (c) When the request is for information from a single or small number of submitters, we send a notice via registered mail to the submitter's last known address. NARA's notice to the submitter includes a copy of the FOIA request and tells the submitter the time limits and procedures for objecting to the release of the requested material.

        (d) When the request involves information from a voluminous number of submitters, we may post or publish the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending letters.

        (e) We provide the submitter with 20 working days from the date of NARA's notice to object to the release and to explain a basis for the objection, including justification and support for the claim. The NARA FOIA Officer may extend this period as appropriate.

        (f) We review and consider all objections to release that we receive within the time limit. Any information provided by a submitter under this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA. NARA considers a submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice to have no objection to disclosure of the information. If we decide to release the records, we inform the submitter in writing, along with NARA's reasons for the decision to release. We include with the notice copies of the records as we intend to release them. We also inform the submitter that we intend to release the records within a reasonable time after the date of the notice unless a U.S. District Court forbids disclosure. NARA will not consider any information we receive after the date of a disclosure decision.

        (g) If the requester files a lawsuit under the FOIA for access to any withheld records, we promptly notify the submitter.

        (h) NARA notifies the requester in three circumstances:

        (1) When we notify the submitter of the opportunity to object to disclosure, or to extend the time for objecting;

        (2) When we notify the submitter of our intent to disclose the requested information; and

        (3) When a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

      (c) In providing for these requirements, NARA does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United States.

      (d) This part provides guidance for the internal operations of NARA. It does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, that a party may rely upon in any legal proceeding against the United States.

      § 1251.2   To what demands does this part apply?

      § 1251.6   How does the General Counsel determine whether to comply with a demand for records or testimony?

#### § § 1251.6

      The General Counsel may consider the following factors in determining whether or not to grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to agency information, or permission to produce records in response to a demand:

      (a) NARA's compliance with the demand is required by federal law, regulation or rule, or is otherwise permitted by this part;

      (b) The purposes of this part are met;

      (c) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

      (d) NARA has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;

      (e) Allowing such testimony or production of records would assist or hinder NARA in performing its statutory duties;

      (f) Allowing such testimony or production of records would involve a substantial use of NARA resources;

      (g) Responding to the demand would interfere with the ability of NARA employees to do their work;

      (h) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of NARA or the United States;

      (i) The records or testimony can be obtained from the publicly available records of NARA or from other sources;

      (j) The demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;

      (k) Disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order or regulation;

      (l) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, otherwise protected information, or information which would otherwise be inappropriate for release;

      (m) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights;

      (n) Disclosure would result in NARA appearing to favor one litigant over another;

      (o) Disclosure relates to documents that were created by another agency;

      (p) A substantial Government interest is implicated;

      (q) The demand is within the authority of the party making it;

      (r) The demand is sufficiently specific to be answered; and

      (s) Other factors, as appropriate.

      § 1251.8   Who is authorized to accept service of a subpoena demanding the production of records or testimony?

#### § § 1251.8

      (a) Demands for testimony, except those involving an employee of NARA's Office of the Inspector General, must be addressed to, and served on, the General Counsel, National Archives and Records Administration, Suite 3110, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.

      (b) Demands for the testimony of an employee of NARA's Office of the Inspector General must be addressed to, and served on, the Inspector General, National Archives and Records Administration, Suite 1300, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.

      (c) Demands for the production of NARA operational records, except those of the Office of the Inspector General, must be addressed to, and served on, the General Counsel.

      (d) Demands for records of the Inspector General must be addressed to, and served on, the Inspector General.

      (e) Demands for the production of records stored in a Federal Records Center (FRC), including the National Personnel Records Center, must be addressed to, and served on, the director of the FRC where the records are stored. NARA honors the demand to the extent required by law, if the agency having legal title to the records has not imposed any restrictions. If the agency has imposed restrictions, NARA notifies the authority issuing the demand that NARA abides by the agency-imposed restrictions and refers the authority to the agency for further action.

      (f) Demands for the production of materials designated as Federal archival records, Presidential records or donated historical materials administered by NARA must be addressed to, and served on either: the Assistant Archivist for Records Services—Washington, DC (for records located in Headquarters); Director of Archival Operations (for records located in the regions); or the appropriate Presidential Library Director.

      (g) For matters in which the United States is a party, the Department of Justice should contact the General Counsel instead of submitting a demand for records or testimony on its own or another agency's behalf.

      (h) The demanding party is responsible for complying with all service requirements, including any additional requirements contained in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or other statutory or regulatory authority.

      (i) Contact information for each NARA facility may be found at 36 CFR part 1253.

      § 1251.10   What are the filing requirements for a demand for documents or testimony?

#### § § 1251.10

      You must comply with the following requirements, as appropriate, whenever you issue a demand to a NARA employee for records, agency information or testimony:

      (a) Your demand must be in writing and must be served on the appropriate party as identified in § 1251.8.

      (b) Demands for production of records that are governed by the Privacy Act require authorization of a court of competent jurisdiction as defined in § 1251.3.

      (c) Your written demand (other than a demand pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a case in which NARA is a party, in which case you must comply with the requirements of that rule) must contain the following information:

      (1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;

      (2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show relevance;

      (3) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;

      (4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain any confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on NARA to produce the records or provide testimony;

      (5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than a NARA employee, such as a retained expert;

      (6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used instead of testimony;

      (7) A description of all previous decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested records or testimony;

      (8) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case; and

      (9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties may require with each NARA employee for time spent by the employee in connection with the request for testimony.

      (d) NARA reserves the right to require additional information to process your demand.

      (e) Your demand (other than a demand pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a case in which NARA is a party, in which case you must comply with the requirements of that rule) should be submitted at least 45 days before the date that records or testimony is required. Demands submitted in less than 45 days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.

      (f) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with your demand.

      (g) The information collection contained in this section has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act under the control number 3095-0038.

      § 1251.12   How does NARA process your demand?

#### § § 1251.12

      (a) After service of a demand for production of records or for testimony, an appropriate NARA official reviews the demand and, in accordance with the provisions of this, determines whether, or under what conditions, to produce records or authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to agency information.

      (b) NARA processes demands in the order in which we receive them. NARA will not complete and return certifications, affidavits, or similar documents submitted with a demand for records, but if requested will certify records in accordance with NARA's published fee schedule at 36 CFR part 1258. Absent exigent or unusual circumstances, NARA responds within 45 days from the date of receipt. The time for response depends upon the scope of the demand.

      (c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of NARA or the United States or for other good cause.

      § 1251.14   Who makes the final determination on compliance with demands for records or testimony?

#### § § 1251.14

      The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands to employees for testimony. The appropriate NARA official authorized to accept service, as described in § 1251.8, makes the final determination on demands for the production of records. The NARA official notifies the requester and, as necessary, the court or other authority of the final determination and any conditions that may be imposed on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of a NARA employee. If the NARA official deems it appropriate not to comply with the demand, the official communicates the reasons for the noncompliance as appropriate.

      § 1251.16   Are there any restrictions that apply to testimony?

#### § § 1251.16

      (a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of NARA employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript of testimony at the requester's expense.

      (b) NARA may offer the employee's written declaration instead of testimony.

      (c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee must not:

      (1) Disclose confidential or privileged information; or

      (2) For a current NARA employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of NARA unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States.

      § 1251.18   Are there any restrictions that apply to the production of records?

#### § § 1251.18

      (a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of records and agency information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, NARA may condition the release of records and agency information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.

      (b) Typically, original NARA records will not be produced in response to a demand. Instead of the original records, NARA provides certified copies for evidentiary purposes (see 28 U.S.C. 1733; 44 U.S.C. 2116). Such copies must be given judicial notice and must be admitted into evidence equally with the originals from which they were made (see 44 U.S.C. 2116). If the General Counsel so determines, under exceptional circumstances, original NARA records may be made available for examination in response to a demand, but they are not to be presented as evidence.

      § 1251.20   Are there any fees associated with producing records or providing testimony?

#### § § 1251.20

      (a)  The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to NARA.

      (b)  Fees for producing records include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time are calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication are the same as those charged by NARA in part 1258 of this title.

      (c)  Fees for attendance by a witness include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees are determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness appears.

      (d)  (1) Witness fees for current NARA employees must be submitted to the General Counsel and made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

      (2) Fees for the production of records, including records certification fees, must be submitted to the official who makes the final determination on demands for the production of records, as described in § 1251.14, and made payable to the National Archives Trust Fund (NATF).

      (3) Applicable fees paid to former NARA employees providing testimony should be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.

      (e)  NARA may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. Request certified copies from NARA at least 45 days before the date they are needed. We charge a certification fee for each document certified.

      (f)  The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of good cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.

      (g)  Fees are not assessed if the total charge is $10.00 or less, or as otherwise stated in NARA policy.

      § 1251.22   Are there any penalties for providing records or testimony in violation of this part?

#### § § 1251.22

      (a) An employee who discloses official records or information or gives testimony relating to official information, except as expressly authorized by NARA or as ordered by a Federal court after NARA has had the opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Additionally, former NARA employees are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 216.

      (b) A current NARA employee who testifies or produces official records and information in violation of this part is subject to disciplinary action.

    PART 1254—USING RECORDS AND DONATED HISTORICAL MATERIALS

### Part 1254

**Authority:** Authority: 44 U.S.C. 2101-2118.

**Source:** Source: 69 FR 39314, June 30, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 1254.1   What kinds of archival materials may I use for research?

#### § § 1254.1

        (a) The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves records of all three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) of the Federal Government in record groups that reflect how government agencies created and maintained them. Most of these records are of Executive Branch agencies. We also have individual documents and collections of donated historical materials that significantly supplement existing records in our custody or provide information not available elsewhere in our holdings. Descriptions of many of our records are available through our Web site,

        (b) We provide information about records and we make them available to the public for research unless they have access restrictions. Some records may be exempt from release by law. Donors may apply restrictions on access to historical materials that they donate to NARA. Access restrictions are further explained in part 1256 of this chapter. We explain procedures for obtaining information about records in § 1254.2.

        (c) In addition to traditional paper (textual) materials, our holdings also include special media materials such as microfilm, still pictures, motion pictures, sound and video recordings, cartographic and architectural records, and electronic records. The majority of these materials are housed at the National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. Many of these types of materials also are represented in the holdings of our Presidential libraries and our regional archives facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter.

        (d) The majority of our archival materials are 30 years old or older.

        (e) Records creating agencies hold the legal title and control access to records housed in NARA records centers. Our procedures to obtain access to these records are in § 1256.2.

        § 1254.2   Does NARA provide information about documents?

#### § § 1254.2

        (a) Upon request, we provide overall information about our holdings or about specific documents, if the time required to furnish the information is not excessive and if the information is not restricted (see part 1256 of this chapter). For anyone unable to visit, we may provide information contained in specific documents by offering copies of the documents for a fee (see § 1254.60).

        (b) Requests must be on designated forms when we require them. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves these forms as information collections and the forms bear the approved control number.

        (c) If requests that we receive in the normal course of reference service do not specifically cite the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended), we do not consider those requests made under the Act. To make a request under the Act, follow the procedures in part 1250 of this chapter.

        § 1254.4   Where and when are documents available to me for research?

#### § § 1254.4

        (a) You may obtain general information about the location of records by visiting the NARA Web site at  writing to the National Archives and Records Administration (NWCC2), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001; completing our Inquire form at  sending a fax request to (301) 837-0483; or calling (202) 501-5400, (301) 837-2000, or toll free (866) 272-6272.

        (b) The locations of NARA's research rooms are shown in part 1253 of this chapter. Hours for research rooms are posted at  Contact our facilities directly for information about their particular holdings. A facility or unit director may authorize that documents be made available at times other than the times specified.

        (c) Before planning a visit, contact the facility holding materials of potential interest to determine whether the documents are available, whether there are enough documents to warrant a visit, or whether ordering copies would be more practical.

        (d) In addition to the procedures in this part, researchers who wish to use archival materials that contain national security classified information must follow procedures in part 1256 of this chapter.

        § 1254.8   What information do I need to provide when applying for a researcher identification card?

#### § § 1254.8

        (a) You must apply in person and show identification containing your picture or physical description, such as a driver's license or school identification card. You also must provide proof of your current address, such as a bank statement, utility bill, or department of motor vehicles change of address card, if the address on your driver's license or other identification is not current. Students who consider the home of their parents as their permanent address, but who do not live there during the academic session, must provide their current student address. If you travel long distance to conduct research in original archival materials at a NARA facility, we may ask you how we can contact you locally. In special circumstances, the director of a facility or unit has the authority to grant exceptions to these requirements.

        (b) If you apply for access to large quantities of documents or to documents that are especially fragile or valuable, we may require you to furnish additional information about reasons why you require access. Some materials are too fragile or valuable for direct handling or viewing. Preservation concerns ( §§ 1254.20(b) and 1254.36(e)) and availability of resources ( § 1254.20(c)) may limit our ability to accommodate certain requests.

        (c) If you are younger than 14, you must follow the procedures in § 1254.24 to seek permission to conduct research.

        (d) We do not issue you a researcher identification card if the appropriate supervisor or director of the NARA facility determines that the documents that you wish to use are not in the legal custody of NARA and you do not present appropriate written authorization from the legal title holder to examine the documents.

        (e) The collection of information contained in this section has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0016.

        § 1254.10   For how long and where is my researcher identification card valid?

#### § § 1254.10

        (a) Your card is valid for 1 year and may be renewed. Cards we issue at one NARA facility are valid at each facility, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Cards are not transferable and you must present your card if a guard or research room attendant requests to see it.

        (b) At NARA facilities in the Washington, DC, area and other NARA facilities that issue and use plastic researcher identification cards as part of their security systems, we issue a plastic card to replace the paper card issued at some NARA facilities at no charge. The plastic card is valid at all NARA facilities.

        § 1254.12   Will NARA log or inspect my computer, other equipment, and notes?

#### § § 1254.12

        (a) If you bring personal computers, scanners, tape recorders, cameras, and other equipment into our facilities, we will inspect the equipment.

        (1) In the Washington, DC, area, you must complete the Equipment Log at the guard's desk. The guard checks the log for proof of your personal ownership before you remove your equipment from the building.

        (2) In the regional archives and Presidential libraries, we may tag your equipment after inspection and approval.

        (b) Not all NARA facilities permit you to take your personal notes into the research room. In research rooms that permit taking in your notes, a NARA or contractor employee may stamp, initial, and date notes and other research materials we approve for admission to indicate that they are your personal property.

        (c) We inspect your personal property, including notes, electrostatic copies, equipment cases, tape recorders, cameras, personal computers, and other property, before you may remove them from our research rooms or facilities.

        § 1254.14   Are some procedures in regional archives and Presidential libraries different from those in the Washington, DC, area?

#### § § 1254.14

        Yes, the variety of facilities, locations of research rooms, room sizes, and other factors contribute to differences in some, but not all, practices from the Washington, DC, area. When the appropriate regional director of archival operations or Presidential library director indicates, you must follow the procedures in regional archives and Presidential library archival research rooms where researchers use original documents. These procedures are in addition to the procedures we specify elsewhere in this part. The procedures are either posted in the facility or the staff gives copies of them to researchers.

      Subpart B—Research Room Rules

        General Procedures

          § 1254.20   What general policies apply in all NARA facilities where archival materials are available for research?

          (a) Researchers may use original documents only in the designated research room at the facility where they are stored.

          (b) Researchers must use microfilm copies or other alternative copies of documents when available, rather than the original documents. Some of our microfilm publications are available in more than one NARA facility.

          (c) We may limit the quantity of documents that we deliver to you at one time. In some research rooms, we furnish records according to a specific time schedule.

          § 1254.22   Do I need to register when I visit a NARA facility for research?

#### § § 1254.22

          (a) Yes, you must register each day you enter a NARA research facility by furnishing the information on the registration sheet or scanning an encoded researcher identification card. We may ask you for additional personal identification.

          (b) NARA facilities in the Washington, DC, area contain several research rooms; you must register in each research room you visit on a daily basis.

          (c) In regional archives, you also sign out when leaving the research room for the day. In some Presidential libraries, where we instruct you to do so, you sign out when you leave the building.

> [69 FR 39314, June 30, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 10415, Mar. 8, 2010]

      Subpart C—Copying Archival Materials

        General Information

          § 1254.60   What are NARA's copying services?

#### § § 1254.60

          (a) You may order copies of many of our documents for a fee. Our fee schedule for copies is located in § 1258.12 of this chapter. Exceptions to the fee schedule are located in § 1258.4. See § 1258.6 about reproductions NARA may provide without charging a fee.

          (b) For preservation reasons, we do not make copies from the original documents if the documents are available on microfilm and a clear copy (electrostatic, photographic, or microfilm) can be made from the microfilm.

          § 1254.62   Does NARA have archival materials protected by copyright?

#### § § 1254.62

          Yes, although many of our holdings are in the public domain as products of employees or agents of the Federal Government, some records and donated historical materials do have copyright protection. Particularly in the case of some special media records, Federal agencies may have obtained materials from private commercial sources, and these may carry publication restrictions in addition to copyright protection. Presidential records may also contain copyrighted materials. You are responsible for obtaining any necessary permission for use, copying, and publication from copyright holders and for any other applicable provisions of the Copyright Act (Title 17, United States Code).

          § 1254.64   Will NARA certify copies?

#### § § 1254.64

          Yes, the responsible director of a unit, or any of his or her superiors, the Director of the Federal Register, and their designees may certify copies of documents as true copies for a fee. The fee is found at § 1258.12(a).

        Rules Relating to Self-Service Copying

          § 1254.70   How may I make my own copies of documents?

#### § § 1254.70

          (a) Self-service copiers are available in some of our facilities. Contact the appropriate facility to ask about availability before you visit.

          (b) In the Washington, DC, area, self-service card-operated copiers are located in research rooms. Other copiers we set aside for use by reservation are located in designated research areas. Procedures for use are outlined in §§ 1254.80 through 1254.84 of this subpart.

          (c) You may use NARA self-service copiers where available after the research room attendant reviews the documents to determine their suitability for copying. The appropriate supervisor or the senior archivist on duty in the research room reviews the determination of suitability if you request.

          (d) We may impose time limits on using self-service copiers if others are waiting to use them.

          (e) In some of our facilities, you may use your own scanner or personal paper-to-paper copier to copy textual materials if the equipment meets our standards cited in §§ 1254.80 and 1254.86. Contact the appropriate facility for additional details before you visit.

          (f) You must follow our document handling instructions in §§ 1254.36 and 1254.72. You also must follow our microfilm handling instructions in § 1254.42.

          (g) You may use a hand-held camera with no flash or a cell phone camera to take pictures of documents only if you have the permission of the research room attendant.

          (h) You may not use a self-service copier or personal scanner to copy some special media records. If you wish to copy motion pictures, maps and architectural drawings, or aerial photographic film, the appropriate staff can advise you on how to order copies. If you wish to obtain copies of electronic records files, the appropriate staff will assist you.

          § 1254.72   What procedures do I follow to copy documents?

#### § § 1254.72

          (a) You must use paper tabs to designate individual documents you wish to copy. You must show the container including the tabbed documents to the research room attendant who determines whether they can be copied on the self-service copier. The manager of the staff administering the research room reviews the determination of suitability if you ask. After copying is completed, you must return documents removed from files for copying to their original position in the file container, you must refasten any fasteners removed to facilitate copying, and you must remove any tabs placed on the documents to identify items to be copied.

          (b) If you are using a reserved copier, you must submit the containers of documents to the attendant for review before your appointment. The review time required is specified in each research room. Research room attendants may inspect documents after copying.

          (c) You may copy from only one box and one folder at a time. After copying the documents, you must show the original documents and the copies to a research room attendant.

          § 1254.74   What documents are unsuitable for copying on a self-service or personal copier or scanner?

#### § § 1254.74

          (a) Bound archival volumes (except when specialized copiers are provided).

          (b) Documents fastened together by staples, clips, acco fasteners, rivets, or similar fasteners, where folding or bending documents may cause damage.

          (c) Documents larger than the glass copy plate of the copier.

          (d) Documents with uncancelled security classification markings.

          (e) Documents with legal restrictions on copying.

          (f) Documents that the research room attendant judges to be in poor physical condition or which may be subject to possible damage if copied.

          § 1254.76   What procedures do I follow to copy formerly national security-classified documents?

#### § § 1254.76

          (a) We must properly cancel security classification markings (Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) and other restricted markings on declassified records before documents are copied. Only a NARA staff member can cancel security markings. Properly declassified documents bear the declassification authority as required by 32 CFR 2001.24.

          (b) You may not remove from the research room copies of documents bearing uncancelled classification markings. We confiscate copies of documents with uncancelled markings.

          (c) When you copy individual documents, the research room staff cancels the classification markings on each page of the copy and places the declassification authority on the first page of each document. If you copy only selected pages from a document, you must make a copy of the first page bearing the declassification authority and attach that page to any subsequent page(s) you copy from the document. You must show this declassification authority to the guard or research room attendant when you remove copies of documents from the research room or the building.

          (d) Before you copy formerly-classified materials, we provide you with a declassification strip, which you attach to the copier. The strip reproduces on each page copied and cancels the security markings. We may also provide a declassification strip to attach to your personal copier or scanner.

          (e) Staff at Presidential libraries cancel security markings before documents are provided to researchers in research rooms.

        Rules Relating to Using Copying Equipment

          § 1254.80   Does NARA allow me to use scanners or other personal copying equipment?

#### § § 1254.80

          (a) Subject to §§ 1254.26(d) and 1254.86, you may use scanners and other copying equipment if the equipment meets certain conditions or minimum standards described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Exceptions are noted in paragraph (h). The supervisor administering the research room or the senior staff member on duty in the research room reviews the research room attendant's determination if you request.

          (b) Equipment platens or copy boards must be the same size or larger than the records. No part of a record may overhang the platen or copy board.

          (c) No part of the equipment may come in contact with records in a manner that causes friction, abrasion, or that otherwise crushes or damages records.

          (d) We prohibit drum scanners.

          (e) We prohibit automatic feeder devices on flatbed scanners. When using a slide scanner, we must check slides after scanning to ensure that no damage occurs while the slide is inside the scanner.

          (f) Light sources must not raise the surface temperature of the record you copy. You must filter light sources that generate ultraviolet light.

          (g) All equipment surfaces must be clean and dry before you use records. You may not clean or maintain equipment, such as replacing toner cartridges, when records are present. We do not permit aerosols or ammonia-containing cleaning solutions. We permit a 50 percent water and 50 percent isopropyl alcohol solution for cleaning.

          (h) If you wish to use a scanner or other personal copier in a regional archives or Presidential library, contact the facility first for approval. Not all facilities permit the use of scanners or personal copying equipment because of space, electrical load concerns, and other reasons. Your request must state the space and power consumption requirements and the intended period of use.

          (i) In facilities that provide a self-service copier or permit the use of personal paper-to-paper copiers or scanners, you must show documents you wish to copy to the research room attendant for approval.

          (j) If you have any question about what is permissible at any given facility, consult with the facility before your visit. Contact information for our facilities is found in part 1253 of this chapter and at the NARA Web site,

          § 1254.82   What limitations apply to my use of self-service card-operated copiers?

#### § § 1254.82

          (a) There is a 5-minute time limit on copiers in research rooms when others are waiting to use the copier. If you use a microfilm reader-printer, we may limit you to three copies when others are waiting to use the machine. If you wish to copy large quantities of documents, you should see a staff member in the research room to reserve a copier for an extended time period.

          (b) If we must cancel an appointment due to copier failure, we make every effort to schedule a new mutually agreed-upon time. However, we do not displace researchers whose appointments are not affected by the copier failure.

          § 1254.84   How may I use a debit card for copiers in the Washington, DC, area?

#### § § 1254.84

          Your research identification card can be used as a debit card if you arrange with the Cashier's Office to set up an account using cash, check, money order, debit card, or credit card. Your researcher identification card number as encoded on the card forms the basis of your account in the debit system. You may also purchase generic debit cards of values up to $20 each from the Cashier's Office using any of the above payment methods. When the Cashier's Office is closed or at any other time during the hours research rooms are open as cited in part 1253 of this chapter, you may use cash or credit card to purchase a debit card from the vending machines located in the research rooms. Inserting the debit card into a card reader connected to the copier enables you to make copies for the appropriate fee, which are found in § 1258.12 of this chapter. You can add value to your card using the vending machine in the research room or at the Cashier's Office. We do not make refunds.

        (b) You must submit your request to use privately owned microfilm equipment four months in advance of the proposed starting date of the microfilming project. If you submit your request with less advance notice, we consider it and may approve it if we have available adequate NARA space and staff and if you can complete all training, records preparation, and other NARA requirements in a shorter time frame.

        (1) You may include in your request only one project to microfilm a complete body of documents, such as an entire series, a major continuous segment of a very large series which is reasonably divisible, or a limited number of separate series related by provenance or subject.

        (2) We do not accept additional requests from an individual or organization to microfilm records in a NARA facility while we evaluate an earlier request from that individual or organization to microfilm records at that facility.

        (3) We establish the number of camera spaces available to a single project based upon the total number of projects approved for filming at that time.

        § 1254.94   What must my request include?

#### § § 1254.94

        (a) A description of the documents you wish to copy that includes the following elements:

        (1) Record group number or agency of origin or, for donated historical materials, title of the collection;

        (d) A statement of the procedures that you will follow to ensure that you copy all pages, that the images on the microfilm are legible, and that the microfilm is properly processed. At a minimum, the procedures should meet the requirements specified in part 1230 of this chapter regarding the microfilming of permanent records.

        § 1254.96   What credits must I give NARA?

#### § § 1254.96

        (a) You must agree to credit NARA as having custody of the original documents. The credit must appear at the beginning of a microfilm publication and in any publicity material or descriptions of the publication.

        (b) If the original documents are Federal records, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are among the records of the (name of agency) in the custody of the National Archives of the United States. (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official U.S. Government records.”

        (c) If the original documents are donated historical materials, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are donated historical materials from (name of donor) in the custody of the (name of Presidential library or National Archives of the United States). The National Archives and Records Administration administers them in accordance with the requirements of the donor's deed of gift and the U.S. Copyright Law, Title 17, U.S.C. (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these donated historical materials.”

        (d) If the original documents are Presidential or Vice-Presidential records as specified in 44 U.S.C. 2201, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are Presidential records in the custody of the (name of Presidential library or National Archives of the United States). The National Archives and Records Administration administers them in accordance with the requirements of Title 44, U.S.C. (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official Presidential records.”

        (e) If the original documents are records of Congress, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are among the records of the (House of Representatives/Senate) in the physical custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). NARA administers them in accordance with the requirements of the (House/Senate). (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official congressional records.”

        § 1254.98   May NARA make subsequent use of my publication?

#### § § 1254.98

        You must give NARA a royalty-free worldwide license, to take effect seven years after you complete filming at the NARA facility, to publish, display, reproduce, distribute, and sell the publication, and to create derivative works based on the publication, and to use the publication in collective works, all without limitation. The license required by this section must be written to take effect upon publication if there is no commercial distributor, or once commercial distribution ends if less than seven years from the date you complete filming at the NARA facility.

        § 1254.100   How does NARA evaluate requests?

#### § § 1254.100

        (a) NARA evaluates requests by estimating how well completion of a proposed project would further our efforts to preserve and to make available to the public the historically valuable records of the Government.

        (b) In considering multiple requests to film at the same time, we give priority to microfilming records that have research value for a variety of studies or that contain basic information for fields of research in which researchers have demonstrated substantial interest.

        (c) The records to be filmed should be reasonably complete and not subject to future additions, especially of appreciable volumes, within the original body of records. Records with pending or future end-of-series additions are appropriate for filming.

        (d) The records to be filmed should not have substantial numbers of documents withdrawn because of continuing national security classification, privacy, or other restrictions.

        (e) We approve only requests to microfilm a complete body of documents, such as an entire series or a major continuous segment of a very large series that is reasonably divisible. Microfilming a complete body of documents means that you must consecutively copy all documents within the file unit(s), from the first to the last page, not skipping any pages in between except for pages that are exact duplicates or blank pages that are not included in a pagination scheme.

        (f) We normally approve only requests that include assurances that the project will adhere to the specifications in part 1230 of this chapter concerning microfilm stock standards, index placement, and microfilm processing for permanent records.

        (g) We approve only requests that specify that NARA will receive a first generation silver halide duplicate negative containing no splices made from the original camera negative of the microform record created in accordance with part 1230 of this chapter.

        (1) We may use this duplicate negative microform to make duplicate preservation and reference copies. The copies may be made available for NARA and public use in NARA facilities and programs immediately upon receipt.

        (2) We may also make additional use of the microform, as indicated in § 1254.98, seven years after you complete filming at the NARA facility, or upon delivery of the publication if there is no commercial distributor, or when the commercial distributor is no longer available, whichever occurs first. We may choose to add our own editorial material to the microform copies.

        (3) You must deliver detailed roll lists with the microfilm. The lists must give the full range of file titles and a complete list of all file numbers on each roll of microfilm. We prefer that the list be provided in a fielded, electronic format to facilitate its use by staff and researchers. If the electronic format is a data file with defined or delimited fields, you should transfer with the file the records layout identifying the fields, any coded values for fields, and explanations of any delimiters.

        (4) Microfilm projects may donate to us additional indexes and finding aids. NARA and the microfilm project execute a deed of gift that specifies restrictions on NARA's use and dissemination of these products under mutually acceptable terms.

        § 1254.102   What requests does NARA not approve?

#### § § 1254.102

        (a) We do not approve any request that does not include all of the information we require in §§ 1254.94 and 1254.96.

        (b) We do not normally approve requests to microfilm documents that:

        (1) Have previously been microfilmed and made available to the public;

        (2) We have approved for microfilming by another party; or

        (3) We plan to film as a NARA microfilm publication or which relate closely to other documents previously microfilmed or approved for microfilming by NARA. We may grant exceptions to this provision at our discretion.

        (c) We normally do not approve requests to microfilm documents:

        (1) Having restrictions on access that preclude their reproduction;

        (2) Known to be protected by copyright;

        (3) Having high intrinsic value that only authorized NARA personnel may handle;

        (4) In vulnerable physical condition;

        (5) Having a high research demand and which we would have to deny to others for an extended period of time during the microfilming process. Where possible, we assist you in developing filming schedules that avoid the need to close documents for a lengthy period of time; and

        (6) In formats, such as oversize documents, bound volumes, and others, that would be subject to excessive stress and possible damage from special equipment you plan to use, as well as documents fastened with grommets, heavy duty staples, miscellaneous fasteners, or wafers and other adhesives that cannot be removed without tearing or breaking documents.

        (d) We normally do not approve requests from persons or organizations that failed to produce usable microfilm or to honor commitments they made in previous requests, or for whom we have had to rescind previous permission to microfilm documents because of their conduct.

        (e) We do not approve requests to microfilm records in NARA facilities in which there is insufficient space available for private microfilming. We do not permit private microfilming in our records storage (stack) areas.

        (1) Federal agencies microfilming records in support of the agency's mission may use the space set aside for private microfilming. Agency microfilming takes priority over private microfilming when there is insufficient space to accommodate both at the same time.

        (2) When a NARA facility does not have enough space to accommodate all requests, we may schedule separate projects by limiting the time allowed for each particular project or by requiring projects to alternate their use of the space.

        (3) We also do not approve requests where the only space available for filming is in the facility's research room, and such work would disturb researchers. We do not move records from a facility lacking space for private microfilming to another NARA facility for that purpose.

        (f) We do not approve requests to microfilm records when there is not enough staff to provide the necessary support services, including document preparation, training of private microfilmers, and monitoring the filming.

        (g) We do not approve the start of a project to microfilm records until you have agreed in writing to the amount and schedule of fees for any training, microfilm preparation, and monitoring we must conduct that is necessary to support your project. Our letter of tentative approval for the project includes an agreement detailing the records in the project and the detailed schedule of fees for NARA services for the project. We give final approval when we receive your signed copy of the agreement.

        § 1254.104   How does NARA determine fees to prepare documents for microfilming?

#### § § 1254.104

        (a) As part of our evaluation of a request to microfilm documents, we determine the amount of microfilm preparation that we must do before you can microfilm the documents and the estimated cost of such preparation. We base fees for microfilm preparation on direct salary costs (including benefits) and supply costs when we perform the work. When a NARA contractor performs the work, the fees are the cost to NARA. Microfilm preparation includes:

        (1) Removing document fasteners from documents when the fasteners can be removed without damage to the documents; and

        (2) Taking any document conservation actions that must be accomplished in order to film the documents, such as document flattening or mending.

        (b) We provide you detailed information on the fees for microfilm preparation in the letter of approval. You must pay fees in accordance with § 1258.14 of this chapter. When a body of documents requires extensive microfilm preparation, we may establish a different payment schedule at our discretion.

        § 1254.106   What are NARA's equipment standards?

#### § § 1254.106

        (a) Because we have limited space in many NARA facilities, microfilm/fiche equipment should be operable from a table top unless we have given written permission to use free standing/floor model cameras. You may only use planetary type camera equipment. You may not use automatic rotary cameras and other equipment with automatic feed devices. We may approve your use of book cradles or other specialized equipment designed for use with bound volumes, oversized documents, or other formats, as well as other camera types not specified here, on a case-by-case basis.

        (b) The power consumption of the equipment normally must not exceed 1.2 kilowatts. Power normally available is 115 volts, 60 hz. You must make requests for electricity exceeding that normally available at least 90 days in advance.

        (c) You may not use equipment having clamps or other devices to exert pressure upon or to attach the document to any surface in a way that might damage the document.

        (d) The equipment must not use a heat generating light source in close enough proximity to the documents to result in their physical distortion or degradation. All sources of ultraviolet light must be filtered.

        § 1254.108   What are NARA's requirements for the microfilming process?

#### § § 1254.108

        (a) Your equipment must conform to the equipment standards in § 1254.106.

        (b) You must handle documents according to the training and instructions provided by our staff so that documents are not damaged during copying and so that their original order is maintained. Only persons who have attended NARA training will be permitted to handle the documents or supervise microfilming operations. We charge you fees for training services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits) and any related supply costs. We specify these fees in the written agreement we require for project approval in § 1254.102(h).

        (c) You may microfilm documents from only one file unit at a time. After you complete microfilming, you must return documents you removed from files for microfilming to their original position in the file container, refasten any fasteners you removed to facilitate copying, and remove any tabs you placed on the documents to identify items to copy. We will provide fasteners for replacement as necessary.

        (d) You may not leave documents unattended on the copying equipment or elsewhere.

        (e) Under normal microfilming conditions, actual copying time per sheet must not exceed 30 seconds.

        (f) You must turn off any lights used with the camera when the camera is not in actual operation.

        (g) You may operate microfilm equipment only in the presence of the research room attendant or a designated NARA employee. If NARA places microfilm projects in a common research area with other researchers, the project will not be required to pay for monitoring that is ordinarily provided. If the microfilm project is performed in a research room set aside for copying and filming, we charge the project fees for these monitoring services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits). When more than one project share the same space, monitoring costs will be divided equally among the projects. We specify the monitoring service fees in the written agreement required for project approval in § 1254.102(h).

        (h) The equipment normally should be in use each working day that it is in a NARA facility. The director of the NARA facility (as defined in § 1252.2 of this chapter) decides when you must remove equipment because of lack of regular use. You must promptly remove equipment upon request of the facility director.

        (i) We assume no responsibility for loss or damage to microfilm equipment or supplies you leave unattended.

        (j) We inspect the microform output at scheduled intervals during the project to verify that the processed film meets the microfilm preparation and filming standards required by part 1230 of this chapter. To enable us to properly inspect the film, we must receive the film within 5 days after it has been processed. You must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative of the filmed records ( § 1254.100(g)) according to the schedule shown in paragraph (k). If the processed film does not meet the standards, we may require that you refilm the records.

        (k) When you film 10,000 or fewer images, you must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative upon completion of the project. When the project involves more than 10,000 images, you must provide a silver halide duplicate negative of the first completed roll or segment of the project reproducing this image count to NARA for evaluation. You also must provide subsequent completed segments of the project, in quantities approximating 100,000 or fewer images, to NARA within 30 days after filming unless we approve other arrangements.

        (l) If the microfilming process is causing visible damage to the documents, such as flaking, ripping, separation, fading, or other damage, filming must stop immediately and until the problems can be addressed.

        § 1254.110   Does NARA ever rescind permission to microfilm?

#### § § 1254.110

        We may, at any time, rescind permission to microfilm records if:

        (a) You fail to comply with the microfilming procedures in § 1254.108;

        (b) Inspection of the processed microfilm reveals persistent problems with the quality of the filming or processing;

        (c) You fail to proceed with the microfilming or project as indicated in the request, or

        (d) The microfilming project has an unanticipated adverse effect on the condition of the documents or the space set aside in the NARA facility for microfilming.

        (e) You fail to pay NARA fees in the agreed to amount or on the agreed to payment schedule.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 1256.1   What does this part cover?

#### § § 1256.1

        This part describes NARA's policies on access to archival records of the Executive Branch and donated historical materials in the National Archives of the United States and to records in the physical custody of the Federal records centers. This part applies to records and materials covered by the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 2108 and chs. 29, 31, 33) and donated historical materials. This part does not apply to Presidential, Supreme Court, Senate, House of Representatives, and Architect of the Capitol records except for the purpose of directing mandatory review requests in subpart E.

        § 1256.2   How do I obtain access to records stored in Federal Records Centers?

#### § § 1256.2

        Agencies that retire their records to a Federal records center (FRC) set rules for access to those records. Address requests for access to records stored in Federal records centers directly to the appropriate agency or to the appropriate FRC director at the address shown in part 1253. When the agency's rules permit, NARA makes FRC records available to requesters. When the agency's rules and restrictions do not permit access FRCs receive requests that should have been sent to the agency, the FRC director refers the requests and any appeals for access, including those made under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended), to the responsible agency.

        § 1256.6   How do I obtain access to records of defunct agencies?

#### § § 1256.6

        NARA handles access to archives and FRC records received from agencies that have ceased to exist without a successor in function as described in Subpart B.

        § 1256.8   How do I obtain access to Presidential records?

#### § § 1256.8

        See 36 CFR part 1270, Presidential Records, for the rules for access to Presidential records transferred to NARA.

        § 1256.10   How do I obtain access to Nixon Presidential materials?

#### § § 1256.10

        See 36 CFR part 1275, Preservation and Protection of and Access to the Presidential Historical Materials of the Nixon Administration, for the rules for access to Nixon Presidential materials.

      Subpart B—Access to Federal Archival Records

        § 1256.20   May I obtain access to Federal archival records?

#### § § 1256.20

        (a) Most Federal archival records are open for research without submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Part 1254 specifies procedures for using unrestricted records in a NARA research room, submitting reference requests, and ordering copies of records.

        (b) Some records are subject to restrictions prescribed by statute, Executive Order, or by restrictions specified in writing in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108 by the agency that transferred the records to the National Archives of the United States. All agency-specified restrictions must comply with the FOIA. Even if the records are not national-security classified, we must screen some records for other information exempt from release under the FOIA.

        § 1256.22   How do I request access to restricted information in Federal archival records?

#### § § 1256.22

        (a) You may file a FOIA request. To request access under the provisions of the FOIA, see part 1250 of this chapter, Public Availability and Use of Federal Records.

        (b) For classified information in Federal records, you may file a FOIA request or a mandatory review request under Executive Order 12958, as amended, as described in § 1256.74.

        § 1256.24   How long may access to some records be denied?

#### § § 1256.24

        (a) Although many records are open for research, some records are closed for long periods, either under our general restrictions, described in subpart D of this part, or another governing authority. For example, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108(b), we do not grant access to restricted census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census less than 72 years old containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses.

        (b) Screening records takes time. We screen records as soon as possible and can often make most of the records in which you are interested available. In the case of electronic structured databases, NARA can make a copy of records with restricted information masked. In response to FOIA requests for records in other media, we make a copy of the record available if we can mask or “redact” restricted information.

        § 1256.26   When can I appeal decisions about access to Federal archival records?

#### § § 1256.26

        (a) For information on filing appeals for requests made under the FOIA, see 36 CFR part 1250, subpart D, Appeals.

        (b) For information on filing appeals for requests made under mandatory review, see § 1260.54 of this chapter.

        § 1256.28   Does NARA make any exceptions for access to records containing privacy-restricted information?

#### § § 1256.28

        (a)  Access to archival records containing information access to which would invade the privacy of an individual is restricted by § 1256.56.

        (1) NARA may authorize access to such records for the purpose of research to qualified persons doing biomedical or social science research under the conditions outlined in this section as long as the records do not also contain information restricted by statute or national security-classified information.

        (2) If NARA is able to make a copy of such records with all personal identifiers masked or deleted, NARA will make such a “sanitized” copy of the record available to all researchers in accordance with § 1256.24.

        (3) NARA will not grant access to restricted census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census less than 72 years old containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108(b).

        (b)  Researchers who wish to have access to records restricted by § 1256.56 to conduct biomedical or social science research must submit a written request to the NARA FOIA/Privacy Act Officer (NGC), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. OMB control number 3095-0002 has been assigned to this collection of information requirement. Researchers are encouraged to consult informally with NARA before submitting the formal request. The request must include the following information:

        (1) Name and mailing address;

        (2) Institutional affiliation and position, if applicable;

        (3) List of published research, if applicable;

        (4) References from two persons who have first-hand knowledge of the requester's qualifications to perform the research;

        (5) A statement of the nature of the research to be conducted and any plans for publication or presentation of the research findings;

        (6) A listing of all sources of grant funds supporting the research project or its publication;

        (7) A statement of the methodology to be used;

        (8) A statement of the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to be employed by the researcher to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records;

        (9) A listing of the record groups and series titles to be used; and

        (10) A statement that the researcher will abide by the conditions of access to be prescribed by NARA and that the researcher will assume responsibility for the action of all persons working with the researcher on the project.

        (c)  Requests made under paragraph (b) of this section will be reviewed by NARA's Access Review Committee, which is composed of the Deputy Archivist of the United States, the Assistant Archivist for the Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, the Assistant Archivist for the Official of Regional Records Services, and the director(s) of the NARA division(s) that has custody of the requested records. The Committee may consult other persons within and outside the Federal Government who are knowledgeable in the research field for assistance in evaluating a request.

        (1) The Committee will examine the request to determine whether:

        (i) The requested information is of such a highly sensitive personal nature that disclosure must not be permitted even for biomedical or social science research;

        (ii) The methodology proposed by the requester will permit the researcher to obtain the projected research results without revealing personally identifying information;

        (iii) The research results are intended to be published or presented at an academic or research conference;

        (iv) The requester is a biomedical or social science researcher who has previous research experience and has submitted or intends to submit articles or books on such research for publication;

        (v) The safeguards proposed by the requester will adequately protect the personal information; and

        (vi) NARA has sufficient staff and space available to safeguard privacy interests necessary to accommodate the research project.

        (2) The decision of the Committee will be made in writing to the requester within 15 workdays after receipt of a completed request. At the discretion of the Committee, the researcher may meet with the Committee to discuss the project or to discuss revising the research proposal to meet possible objections of the Committee.

        (d)  Researchers who are granted access to restricted records, all others associated with the research project who will have access to personally identifiable information from the records, and the manager of any facility handling the records containing personal identifiers must agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to adhere to the conditions of access imposed by NARA. NARA will impose the following conditions of access on any project; additional conditions may be imposed on the use of specific records or on specific projects:

        (1) The records may be used only for the purpose of the research and for the reporting of research findings as described in the approved research project. The records may not be used for any other purpose;

        (2) The records and any authorized copies of records may not be transferred to any person or institution not directly involved with the approved research project and subject to a written agreement to maintain confidentiality specified in § 1256.28(d);

        (3) Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, as approved by NARA, to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records must be established by the researcher and followed by all persons associated with the project;

        (4) When required by NARA, the records must be consulted at the NARA facility where the records are located;

        (5) The researcher's notes must not contain any individually identifiable information. The researcher must use an alternate code system to render personally identifiable information as anonymous in all research notes;

        (6) Persons who are identified in the records may not be contacted by or on behalf of the researcher;

        (7) Before publication or public presentation of the data, the final research product(s) must be provided to the Deputy Archivist of the United States for review. NARA's review is limited to ensuring that there is no possible identification of individuals in the research findings. NARA will not evaluate the validity of the research findings.

        (e)  If we discover that a researcher has violated any of the conditions of access, we will take steps to revoke the NARA research privileges of that person and will consult with NARA's General Counsel or his or her designee to determine any other steps to be taken to prevent any further disclosure of the personal information concerned. NARA may also inform the following persons and organizations of the researcher's failure to follow the conditions of use:

        (1) The institution with which the researcher is affiliated, if applicable;

        (2) Persons who served as references in the application for access;

        (3) Organizations that provided grant funds for the project;

        (4) The sponsor of the publication or public presentation; and

        (5) Appropriate professional organizations.

      Subpart C—Access to Donated Historical Materials

        § 1256.30   How do I obtain access to donated historical materials?

#### § § 1256.30

        NARA encourages researchers to confer about donated historical materials with the appropriate director or reference staff member at the facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter. Some donated historical materials have restrictions on their use and availability as stated in writing by the donors in the Donor's Deed of Gift. Some may have other restrictions imposed by statute or Executive Order. If warranted, the Archivist may apply general restrictions to donated materials even when not specified in the donor's deed of gift. NARA staff can assist you with questions about restrictions or copyright protection that may apply to donated materials. See § 1256.36 for information on appealing closure of donated materials and subpart D of this part for information about general restrictions.

        § 1256.32   How do I request access to restricted information in donated historical materials?

#### § § 1256.32

        (a) At Presidential libraries and regional archives, you may write to the appropriate director at the facilities in part 1253 of this chapter. In the Washington, DC, area, you may write to the Director of Access Programs (NWC) for donated textual materials or the Director of Modern Records Programs (NWM) for donated electronic records. The mailing address for NWC and NWM is Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.

        (b) You may request a review of documents restricted under terms of a donor's deed of gift or other legal instrument to determine whether the conditions originally requiring the closure still exist. Your request must describe each document requested so that the staff can locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. For files that NARA previously screened, you may cite the reference to the withheld document as it appears on the withdrawal sheet.

        (c) In many instances, the director or his or her designated representative will determine whether entire documents or portions of them can be opened. However, a donor or his or her representative reserves the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed ( § 1256.36).

        (d) For classified information in donated historical materials, you may file a mandatory review request under Executive Order 12958, as amended, as described in § 1256.74.

        § 1256.34   How long may access to some donated historical materials be denied?

#### § § 1256.34

        Some donated historical materials are closed for long periods, either under the provisions of the deed of gift, our general restrictions described in subpart D of this part, or another governing authority. We are sometimes able to make a copy of materials with restricted information redacted.

        § 1256.36   When can I appeal decisions about access to donated historical materials?

#### § § 1256.36

        (a) If you wish to appeal a denial of access from the director or his designated representative in implementing the provisions of a donor's deed of gift, you may write a letter addressed to the Deputy Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. The Deputy Archivist, the Assistant Archivist for Presidential Libraries, and the Assistant Archivist for Records Services—Washington, DC, or their designated representatives, compose the Board of Review for appeals relating to donated historical materials.

        (b) The board's decision is final. If the board cannot make a determination on your request within 30 working days of receipt, NARA informs you of the reason for the delay. If the board determines that a document should remain closed, you may not file a new appeal for two years. Similarly, you may not file an appeal on documents in collections that have been open for research for less than 2 years.

        (c) In some cases, the donor or his representative may reserve the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed; you cannot appeal such decisions.

        (d) For information on filing appeals for requests made under mandatory review of White House originated information, see § 1260.62 of this chapter.

      Subpart D—General Restrictions

        § 1256.40   What are general restrictions?

#### § § 1256.40

        General restrictions apply to certain kinds of information or classes of records, regardless of the record group to which the records have been allocated. These general restrictions may apply to records and materials not covered by the Freedom of Information Act. The general restrictions are listed and explained in §§ 1256.46 through 1256.62.

        § 1256.42   Who imposes general restrictions?

#### § § 1256.42

        The Archivist of the United States imposes all general restrictions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and 44 U.S.C. 2107(4), 2108, and 2111.

        § 1256.44   Does NARA ever waive general restrictions?

#### § § 1256.44

        NARA may provide access to records withheld under a general restriction only to:

        (a) NARA employees for work purposes;

        (b) The creating agency or its authorized agent in the conduct of agency business;

        (c) The donor, in the case of donated historical materials; or

        (d) The subject of the records in some cases or the subject's authorized agent.

        § 1256.46   National security-classified information.

#### § § 1256.46

        In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1), NARA cannot disclose records containing information regarding national defense or foreign policy that is properly classified under the provisions of the pertinent Executive Order on Classified National Security Information and its implementing directive (Executive Order 12958, as amended).

        § 1256.48   Information about internal agency rules and practices.

#### § § 1256.48

        (a) NARA may withhold from disclosure, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2), the following:

        (1) Records that contain information on substantial internal matters of agencies that, if disclosed, could risk circumvention of a legal requirement, such as a statute or an agency regulation.

        (2) Records containing information that states or assesses an agency's vulnerability to outside interference or harm. NARA withholds records that identify agency programs, systems, or facilities deemed most sensitive. NARA also withholds records describing specific measures that can be used to counteract such agency vulnerabilities.

        (b) The Archivist of the United States may determine that this general restriction does not apply to specific records because enough time has passed that agency statutes or regulations would not be compromised and programs, systems, and facilities would not be harmed.

        § 1256.50   Information exempted from disclosure by statute.

#### § § 1256.50

        In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), NARA withholds records containing information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute when that statute:

        (a) Requires withholding information from the public, leaving no discretion; or

        (b) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.

        § 1256.52   Trade secrets and commercial or financial information.

#### § § 1256.52

        In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), NARA may withhold records that contain trade secrets and commercial or financial information, obtained from a person, that is privileged or confidential. Such records may be disclosed only if:

        (a) The person who provided the information agrees to its release; or

        (b) In the judgment of the Archivist of the United States, enough time has passed that release of the information would not result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter of the information. See 36 CFR 1250.82 for additional regulatory guidance.

        § 1256.54   Inter- and intra-agency memoranda (subject to privilege).

        § 1256.56   Information that would invade the privacy of a living individual.

#### § § 1256.56

        (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), NARA will withhold records in personnel and medical and similar files containing information about a living individual that reveals details of a highly personal nature that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

        (1) The release of the information does not interfere with law enforcement proceedings;

        (2) The release of the information would not deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

        (3) The release of the information would not constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

        (4) Confidential sources and information provided by a confidential source are not revealed;

        (5) Confidential investigation techniques are not described; and

        (6) Release of the information would not endanger the life or physical safety of any person.

        (b) The Archivist of the United States may determine that this general restriction does not apply to specific records because enough time has passed that:

        (1) The safety of persons is not endangered, and

        (2) The public interest in disclosure outweighs the continued need for confidentiality.

        § 1256.60   Information relating to financial institutions.

#### § § 1256.72

        (a) You may file a FOIA request for Executive Branch agency records, regardless of whether they contain classified information. The FOIA also applies to Presidential records as cited in § 1256.74(b). The FOIA does not apply to records of the Judicial and Legislative Branches or to donated historical materials.

        (b) You may only file a mandatory review request if the records contain classified information. NARA handles mandatory review requests for records we hold for the Executive, Judicial, and Legislative Branches as well as donated historical materials under E.O. 12958, as amended, section 3.5.

        § 1256.74   How does NARA process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for classified information?

#### § § 1256.74

        (a) NARA processes FOIA requests for access to classified information in Federal records in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1250. Time limits for responses to FOIA requests for classified information are those provided in the FOIA, rather than the longer time limits provided for responses to mandatory review requests specified by Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333), as amended by Executive Order 13292 (68 FR 15315, 3 CFR, 2003 Comp., p. 196).

Time limits for responses to FOIA requests for classified information are those provided in the FOIA, the PRA, and Executive Order 13233, Further Implementation of the Presidential Records Act (3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 815).

        § 1256.76   How do I request mandatory review of classified information under Executive Order 12958, as amended?

#### § § 1256.76

        (a) You may request mandatory review of classified information that is in the legal custody of NARA, as well as in legislative and judicial records NARA holds. Your mandatory review request must describe the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable NARA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. When possible, a request must include the name of the originator and recipient of the information, as well as its date, subject, and file designation. Information we reviewed within the previous 2 years is not subject to mandatory review. We notify you if this provision applies to your request.

        (b) You must address your mandatory review request to the appropriate staff in the following table.

        § 1256.78   How does NARA handle my mandatory review request?

#### § § 1256.78

        (a) You may find our procedures for mandatory review and appeals of denials in part 1260 of this chapter, Declassification of National Security Information.

        (1) When agencies provide declassification guidance and delegate declassification authority to the Archivist of the United States, NARA reviews for declassification and releases the requested information or those declassified portions of the request that constitute a coherent segment unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.

        (2) When we do not have guidance from agencies, we coordinate the declassification review with the original classifying agency or agencies under the provisions of part 1260, subchapter D of this chapter.

        (b) If we cannot identify the information you seek from the description you provide or if the volume of information you seek is so large that processing it would interfere with our capacity to serve all requesters on an equitable basis, we notify you that, unless you provide additional information or narrow the scope of your request, we cannot take further action.

        § 1256.80   How does NARA provide classified access to historical researchers and former Presidential appointees?

#### § § 1256.80

        (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 4.4 of E.O. 12958, as amended, we may grant access to classified information to certain eligible persons. These persons are engaged in historical research projects or previously occupied policy-making positions to which they were appointed by the President. If you seek permission to examine materials under this special historical researcher/Presidential appointees access program, you must contact NARA in advance. We need at least 4 months before you wish to have access to the materials to permit time for the responsible agencies to process your request for access. If you seek access to classified Presidential records under section 4.4 of E.O. 12958, you must first qualify under special access provisions of 44 U.S.C. 2205. NARA informs you of the agencies to which you have to apply for permission to examine classified information, including classified information originated by the White House or classified information in the custody of the National Archives which was originated by a defunct agency.

        (b) You may examine records under this program only after the originating or responsible agency:

        (1) Determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of national security; and

        (2) Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is safeguarded in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12958, as amended.

        (c) The originating or responsible agency limits the access granted to former Presidential and Vice Presidential appointees to items that the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as an appointee.

        (d) To protect against the possibility of unauthorized access to restricted documents, a director may issue instructions supplementing the research room rules provided in 36 CFR part 1254.

    PART 1258—FEES

### Part 1258

**Authority:** Authority: 44 U.S.C. 2116(c) and 44 U.S.C. 2307.

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 62632, October 11, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1258.1   [Reserved]

#### § § 1258.1

      § 1258.2   What definitions apply to the regulations in this part?

#### § § 1258.2

      means the method of acquiring archival records or donated materials from various Governmental bodies.

      means records that have been accessioned into the legal custody of NARA, donated historical materials in the legal custody of NARA and its Presidential libraries, and Congressional, Supreme Court, and other historical materials in NARA's physical custody and for which NARA has a formal agreement for their permanent retention.

      means affixing a seal to copies certifying the copies are a valid reproduction of a file; this service is available for an additional fee.

      means the total amount of money spent by the NATF for providing services including, but not limited to, salaries; benefits; rent; communication and utilities; printing and reproductions; consulting and other services; payments to other agencies/funds; supplies and materials; depreciation; system upgrades/replacements;

      mean NARA's Federal Records Centers, National Personnel Records Center, archival reference operations nationwide, and Presidential Libraries.

      means the price researchers pay for reproductions of records. Certification of records is also a reproduction fee.

      means Federal records in the physical custody of NARA records centers, but still in the legal custody of the agencies that created and maintained them.

      § 1258.4   What costs make up the NARA fees?

#### § § 1258.4

      (a) 44 U.S.C. 2116(c) allows the NATF to recover all of its costs for providing records reproduction services to the public. The vast majority of materials that are reproduced are from the holdings of NARA, which require special handling, due to the age, condition and historical significance. Examples of special handling include the following:

      (1)  Many of the records are fragile and have historical uniqueness; reproduction equipment operators must take great care in handling these records. For example, each page of a document must be carefully placed by hand on the reproduction equipment, a copy made, the page removed, and the process re-started.

      (2)  Older records may be handwritten and darkened from age, which requires extra time to make sure we produce copies that are as clear and legible as possible.

      (3)  Because of the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, automatic document feeders cannot be used for the duplication of paper materials. This adds time and cost to the price of copying these irreplaceable documents.

      (b) The NATF costs, at a minimum, include:

      (1) Salaries and benefits of the NATF staff involved in all aspects of the records reproduction process (includes, but is not limited to, compensation for full- and part-time employees, temporary appointments, overtime, awards, Civil Service Retirement Service and Federal Employees' Retirement System contributions, health benefits, life insurance benefits and Thrift Savings Plan contributions).

      (2) Travel and transportation (includes, but is not limited to, travel and transportation of persons, transportation of things, and contract mail service).

      (3) Rent, communications and utilities (includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications, equipment rental, and postage).

      (4) Printing and reproductions (includes, but is not limited to, commercial printing, advertising, and printing of forms).

      (5) Consulting and other services (includes, but is not limited to, management and professional services, contract labor, work performed in support of reproduction orders, and maintenance of equipment).

      (6) Payments to other agencies/funds (includes, but is not limited to, reimbursements and payments to other agencies and other funds within NARA). Specifically, the NATF “hires” the NARA custodial units to do reproduction work. In return, the NATF reimburses the custodial units for the cost of salaries and benefits.

      (7) Supplies and materials (includes, but is not limited to, general supplies, and materials and parts).

      (8) Depreciation (spreading the cost of an asset over the span of several years).

      (9) System upgrades/replacement (includes, but is not limited to, installation of operating equipment, software upgrades, and system changes).

      § 1258.6   How does NARA calculate fees for individual products?

#### § § 1258.6

      NARA calculates the fees for individual products using the following:

      (a)  A summary of all costs incurred by the NATF in providing records reproduction services.

      (b)  The percentage of the total NATF revenue represented by sales of a product. This is determined and used where a more accurate percentage based upon actual usage is not available. To calculate this percentage, an analysis is made to determine the current percent of NATF sales revenue represented by each product line. The sales volume is then reviewed with the custodial units to determine if this represents anticipated sales.

      (c)  Using the information calculated in the Cost Summary, the actual revenue cost percentage is determined. In some cases, the actual percentage of cost can be calculated from available data or known constraints of the product line. For example, if the contractor responsible for providing copy support does not support the reproduction of a given product line then zero (0) percent of the contractor's costs would be allocated to that product line.

      (d)  The prediction of a product's sales volume in future year(s). These estimates are made by working with the custodial units and taking into account historical sales volume. An annual percent change is then estimated

      (e)  The amount paid to the custodial units for records reproductive services in support of NATF customer orders. The NATF reimburses the custodial units for services rendered to the NATF for the reproduction of NARA holdings. To determine the reimbursement per copy for an item, past reimbursement fees are changed by the compounded annual Government salary changes as issued by the Office of Personnel Management for the fiscal years being projected. The new rates are reviewed with custodial unit personnel and adjustments are made as required.

      (f)  The costs unique to a given product line. Each product line is evaluated to determine the costs that are unique to that product line, such as purchase and installation costs of specialty equipment, replacement costs for aging equipment, copier leases and maintenance costs, etc. These costs are then allocated against those product lines that use the equipment. Where costs cross product lines, the allocations are apportioned based upon the percent of the estimated copy volume for each product line.

      (g)  The product fee is calculated by the following formula: {[(Percent of Revenue * NATF Overhead Costs) + Reimbursement + Additional Costs]/Projected Sales Volume}

      (h)  After the suggested new fees are calculated, NATF reviews them to establish the final fees. Fees may be adjusted across product lines to ensure that the NATF can succeed in total cost recovery.

      § 1258.8   How does NARA change fees for existing records reproductions?

#### § § 1258.8

      (a) The NATF conducts periodic reviews of its fees to ensure that the costs of providing services to the public are properly recovered.

      (b) Existing records reproduction fees may be adjusted annually based on the following factors:

      (1) Inflation.

      (2) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) salary changes.

      (3) Reallocation of shared costs across product lines using the methodology described in § 1258.6.

      (4) The projected sales volume for the product.

      (5) The actual sales volume for the product.

      (6) The approval of the Archivist of the United States.

      (d) NARA will place a notice on our Web site () annually when announcing that records reproduction fees will be adjusted in accordance with this regulation.

      § 1258.10   How does NARA develop and publicize new records reproduction fees?

#### § § 1258.10

      (a) Custodial units prepare a justification proposal for a proposed records reproduction service and send the justification to the custodial unit office head, through appropriate channels, for concurrence and forwarding to NATF. The justification proposal includes, at a minimum, the following information:

      (1) Estimated monthly volume of product orders based on available historical data;

      (2) Identification of the equipment and supplies required to provide the product and service;

      (3) Brief description of the process required to provide the product and service, including the amount of time for each number and grade level of staff.

      (4) Identification of any services or products that will be replaced by the proposed products and services;

      (5) Identification of other NARA units that may have a demand for the proposed services; and

      (6) Any other relevant information.

      (b) After receiving the proposal, NATF staff:

      (1) Assesses the potential customer base for the proposed products and services, consulting other NARA offices.

      (2) If the potential demand does not warrant establishing fees for new records reproduction products and services, NATF notifies the proposing office that the new product and service are not approved and the reasons why.

      (3) If the potential demand warrants, NATF prepares a cost analysis following the methodology in § 1258.6 and develops a proposed recommended fee for review by NARA's Financial Resources Division and approval by the Archivist of the United States.

      (c)  (1) The public will be notified of new records reproduction services, including the business case for determining initial fee, on-line at  by press releases, and through NARA's social media outlets.

      (2) New records reproduction services fees have an initial trial period of one year. During this time, the public is encouraged to provide feedback to NARA about the new records reproduction services and their fees as directed in the notification of the new services.

      (3) Prior to the expiration of a trial period, NATF will assess the validity of the fees for the new records reproduction products and services, and make one of three determinations:

      (i) Retain products, services and fees;

      (ii) Retain products or services but adjust fees up or down; or

      (iii) Discontinue products or services.

      (d) The public will be notified of NATF determination, including business case for determination, in NARA research rooms nationwide, on-line at  press releases, and through NARA's social media outlets.

      § 1258.12   When does NARA provide records reproductions without charge?

#### § § 1258.12

      At the discretion of the Secretary of the NATF, customers are not charged a fee for records reproductions or certifications in the instances described in this section.

      (a) When NARA furnishes copies of records to other elements of the Federal Government. However, a fee may be charged if the appropriate director determines that the service cannot be performed without reimbursement;

      (b) When NARA wishes to disseminate information about its activities to the general public through press, radio, television, and newsreel representatives;

      (c) When the reproduction is to furnish the donor of a document or other gift with a copy of the original;

      (d) When the reproduction is for individuals or associations having official voluntary or cooperative relations with NARA in its work;

      (e) When the reproduction is for a foreign, State, or local government or an international agency and furnishing it without charge is an appropriate courtesy; and

      (f) For records of other Federal agencies in NARA Federal records centers only:

      (1) When furnishing the service free conforms to generally established business custom, such as furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Government employees;

      (2) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of the document is required to obtain from the Government financial benefits to which the requesting person may be entitled ( veterans or their dependents, employees with workmen's compensation claims, or persons insured by the Government);

      (3) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of a hearing or other formal proceeding involving security requirements for Federal employment is requested by a person directly concerned in the hearing or proceeding; and

      (4) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of a document is for a person who has been required to furnish a personal document to the Government ( a birth certificate required to be given to an agency where the original cannot be returned to the individual).

      § 1258.16   What is NARA's refund policy?

#### § § 1258.16

      Due to various factors, it is occasionally difficult for NARA to make a legible reproduction. NARA will notify customers and ask for approval to proceed if we anticipate a reproduction of questionable legibility. As a result, NARA does not provide refunds except in special cases. If a customer requests a refund, we review the order to determine if we properly notified the customer of the questionable nature of the original and if the product is a true representation of the original. If the product is a true representation of the original, we will not issue a refund.

        § 1260.40   What types of referrals will the NDC process?

#### § § 1260.40

        The NDC processes referrals of both Federal records and Presidential records. Referrals identified in accessioned Federal records will be processed by the Interagency Referral Center (IRC); referrals identified in records maintained by the Presidential Libraries will be processed by the Remote Archives Capture (RAC) Project. (The RAC Project is a collaborative program to facilitate the declassification review of classified records in the Presidential Libraries in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order. In this project, classified Presidential records at the various Presidential Libraries are scanned and brought to the Washington, DC, metropolitan area in electronic form for review by equity-holding agencies.)

        § 1260.42   How does the NDC process referrals of Federal Records?

#### § § 1260.42

        (a) All referrals are processed through the IRC.

        (b) Agencies will have one year from the time they receive formal notification of referrals by the NDC to review their equity in the records. If an agency does not complete its review within one year of formal notification, its information will be automatically declassified in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order unless the information has been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.

        (c) Once notified, the agencies will coordinate their review with the NDC so the NDC can properly manage the workflow of the IRC.

        § 1260.44   How does the NDC process RAC Project referrals?

#### § § 1260.44

        (a) The Presidential Libraries use the RAC Project to process referrals.

        (b) Agencies will be notified of RAC Project referrals according to an annual prioritization schedule via the NDC.

        (c) The RAC Project identifies the primary agency with equity in the record.

        (d) The primary agency will have up to one year from the time it is notified of their referral to complete the review of its equity and identify all other agencies (“secondary agencies”) with an interest in the record. If an agency does not complete its review in one year, its equity will be automatically declassified.

        (e) Secondary agencies receiving notification of their referrals through the RAC Project will have up to one year from the date of notification to complete their review.

        § 1260.46   How does the Department of Defense process referrals?

#### § § 1260.46

        (a) The Department of Defense (DOD) established the Joint Referral Center (JRC) to review DOD agencies' records and all DOD equities within those records for declassification in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order.

        (b) The JRC shall include sufficient quality assurance review policies that are in accordance with policies at the NDC and will provide the NDC with sufficient information on the results of these reviews to facilitate non-DOD agency referral processing and final archival processing for public release.

        (c) NARA may loan accessioned records to the JRC for this purpose.

      Subpart D—Automatic Declassification

        § 1260.50   How are records at NARA reviewed as part of the automatic declassification process?

#### § § 1260.50

        (a) Consistent with the requirements of section 3.3 of Executive Order 13526 on automatic declassification, NARA staff may review for declassification records for which the originating agencies have provided written authority to apply their approved declassification guides. The originating agency must review records for which this authority has not been provided.

        (b) Agencies may choose to review their own records that have been transferred to NARA's legal custody, by sending personnel to the NARA facility where the records are located to conduct the declassification review.

        (c) Classified materials in the Presidential Libraries may be referred to agencies holding equity in the records through the RAC Project.

        § 1260.52   What are the procedures when agency personnel review records in NARA's legal and physical custody?

#### § § 1260.52

        (a) NARA will:

        (1) Make the records available to properly cleared agency reviewers;

        (2) Provide space for agency reviewers in the facility in which the records are located to the extent that space is available; and

        (3) Provide training and guidance for agency reviewers on the proper handling of archival materials.

        (b) Agency reviewers must:

        (1) Follow NARA security regulations and abide by NARA procedures for handling archival materials;

        (2) Use the Standard Form (SF) 715 and follow NARA procedures for identifying and documenting records that require exemption, referral, or exclusion in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order or 32 CFR 2001.30(p); and

        (3) Obtain permission from NARA before bringing into a NARA facility computers, scanners, tape recorders, microfilm readers, and other equipment necessary to view or copy records. NARA will not allow the use of any equipment that poses an unacceptable risk of damage to archival materials. See 36 CFR part 1254 for more information on acceptable equipment.

        (4) Provide NARA with information, as requested by the Archivist and/or NDC Director, on their review so as to facilitate the processing of referrals and archival processing.

        § 1260.54   Will NARA loan accessioned records back to the agencies to conduct declassification review?

#### § § 1260.54

        In rare cases, when agency reviewers cannot be accommodated at a NARA facility, NARA will consider a request to loan records back to an originating agency in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area for declassification review. Each request will be judged on a case-by-case basis. The requesting agency must:

        (a) Ensure that the facility in which the documents will be stored and reviewed passes a NARA inspection to ensure that the facility maintains:

        (1) The correct archival environment for the storage of permanent records; and

        (2) The correct security conditions for the storage and handling of classified national security materials.

        (b) Meet NARA requirements for ensuring the safety of the records;

        (c) Abide by NARA procedures for handling of archival materials;

        (d) Identify and mark documents that cannot be declassified in accordance with NARA procedures; and

        (e) Obtain NARA approval for use of any equipment such as scanners, copiers, or cameras to ensure that they do not pose an unacceptable risk of damage to archival materials.

        § 1260.56   What are NARA considerations when implementing automatic declassification?

#### § § 1260.56

        (a)  Classified records within an integral file block that have not been reviewed and properly exempted from declassification, or referred to an equity holder, will be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block, except as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of automatic declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only records dated within 10 years of the oldest record in the block. The records of each Presidential Administration will be treated as an integral file block and will be scanned for declassification review through the RAC Project.

        (b)  After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center and before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly. NARA, through the NDC, will coordinate processing of referrals made in these special media records as part of its overall prioritization strategy.

        (c)  The IRC at the NDC will provide official notification for Federal records, while the RAC Project will provide formal notification for Presidential records. For agencies which fail to act on their referrals after formal notification by the IRC or the RAC Project, NARA will automatically declassify their information in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order.

        (d)  Agencies will identify referrals in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of the Order. NARA will delay automatic declassification for up to 1 year for classified records that have been identified by the originating agency or by NARA as having classified information that requires referral that were not identified by the primary reviewing agency.

        (e)  Information from another agency that has not been properly identified and referred is not subject to automatic declassification. When NARA identifies information, in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order, that agency will have up to 1 year from the date of formal notification to review its information for declassification.

        (f)  When NARA identifies a file series or collection in its physical and legal custody that contains classified information over 25 years old and that was inadvertently not reviewed before the effective date of automatic declassification, NARA must report the discovery to the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and to the responsible agency head or senior agency official within 90 days of discovery. ISOO, the responsible agency, and NARA will consult on a delay of up to three years to review the records.

      Subpart E—Systematic Declassification

        § 1260.60   How does the NDC facilitate systematic review of records exempted at the individual record or file series level?

#### § § 1260.60

        (a) NARA, through the NDC, follows the procedures established in § 1260.52 above regarding agency access for review of exempt file series.

        (b) NARA, through the NDC, will establish a prioritization schedule for review of exempted individual Federal records. This schedule will take into account upcoming exemption expiration, researcher interest and likelihood of declassification. This schedule will be included as part of the NDC annual work plan.

        (c) The Presidential Libraries will work directly with agencies to facilitate the review of records exempted at the file series level.

        (d) The Presidential Libraries, through the NDC, will establish a prioritization schedule for review of previously exempted classified materials in the Presidential Library system. These materials will be referred to agencies holding equity in the records via the RAC Project.

      Subpart F—Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR)

        § 1260.70   How does a researcher submit an MDR request?

#### § § 1260.70

        (a) For Federal records in NARA's physical and legal custody, requests for MDR should be submitted to: National Archives at College Park, ANDC (Attn: MDR Staff), 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 2600, College Park MD 20740 or

        (b) For Presidential records, Nixon Presidential materials, or donated presidential materials in the custody of the Presidential Libraries, MDR requests should be submitted to the Presidential Library with physical and legal custody of the records;

        (c) For Congressional records in NARA's custody, MDR requests should be submitted to: The Center for Legislative Archives, 700 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20408 or

        (d) For all records in NARA's physical and legal custody, MDR requests must describe the record or material with sufficient specificity to enable NARA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. If NARA is unable to locate the record or material, or requires additional information, NARA will inform the requester.

        § 1260.72   What procedures does NARA follow when it receives a request for Executive Branch records under MDR?

#### § § 1260.72

        (a) NARA will review the requested records and determine if they have already been released. If not, NARA will refer copies of the records to the originating agency and to agencies that may have an interest or activity with respect to the classified information for declassification review. Agencies may also send personnel to a NARA facility where the records are located to conduct a declassification review, or may delegate declassification authority to NARA.

        (b) When the records were originated by a defunct agency that has no successor agency, NARA is responsible for making the declassification determinations, but will consult with agencies having interest in or activity with respect to the classified information.

        (c) If the document or information has been reviewed for declassification within the past 2 years, NARA may opt not to conduct a second review and may instead inform the requester of this fact and of the prior review decision and advise the requester of appeal rights in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33.

        (d) If NARA determines that a requester has submitted a request for the same information under both MDR and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended, NARA will notify the requester that he/she is required to elect one process or the other. If the requester fails to elect one or the other, the request will be treated under the FOIA, unless the requested information or materials are subject only to mandatory review.

        (e) In every case, NARA will acknowledge receipt of the request and inform the requester of the action taken. If additional time is necessary to make a declassification determination on material for which NARA has delegated authority, NARA will tell the requester how long it will take to process the request and advise the requester of available appeal rights. NARA may also inform the requester if part or all of the requested information is referred to other agencies for declassification review in accordance with section 3.6(a) and (b) of the Executive Order.

        (f) If NARA fails to provide the requester with a final decision on the mandatory review request within one year of the original date of the request, the requester may appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP).

        § 1260.74   What are agency responsibilities after receiving an MDR request forwarded by NARA?

#### § § 1260.74

        (a) The agency receiving the referral will promptly process and review the referral for declassification and public release on a line-by-line basis in accordance with section 3.5(c) of the Order and communicate its review decisions to NARA.

        (b) The agency must notify NARA of any other agency to which it forwards the request in those cases requiring the declassification determination of another agency to which NARA has not already sent a referral for review.

        (c) The agency must return to NARA a complete copy of each referred document with the agency determination clearly stated to leave no doubt about the status of the information and the authority for its continued classification or its declassification.

        § 1260.76   What are NARA's procedures after it has received the agency's declassifications determination?

#### § § 1260.76

        (a) If a document cannot be declassified in its entirety, the agency must return to NARA a copy of the document with those portions that require continued classification clearly marked. If a document requires continued classification in its entirety, the agency must return to NARA a copy of the document clearly so marked.

        (b) NARA will notify the requester of the results of its review and make available copies of documents declassified in full and in part. If the requested information cannot be declassified in its entirety, NARA will send the requester a notice of the right to appeal the determination within 60 calendar days to the Deputy Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. Additional information on appeals is located in 36 CFR Part 1264 and in Appendix A to 32 CFR Part 2001 (Article VIII).

        § 1260.78   What is the appeal process when an MDR request for Executive Branch information in NARA's legal custody is denied in whole or in part?

#### § § 1260.78

        (a) NARA shall respond to the requester in writing that her/his mandatory declassification review request was denied in full or in part and the rationale for the denial by using the appropriate category in either section 1.4 of the Order for information that is less than 25 years old, or section 3.3 of the Order for information that is older than 25 years, or 32 CFR 2001.30(p) for information governed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the National Security Act of 1947, as amended. NARA will send the requester a notice of the right to appeal the determination within 60 calendar days to the Deputy Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD.

        § 1270.20   Presidential records in the physical custody of the Archivist.

#### § § 1270.20

        During a President's term of office, the President may request that the Archivist maintain physical custody of Presidential records, including digital or electronic records. However, the President remains exclusively responsible for control and access to their records until their term of office concludes. During the President's terms of office, the Archivist does not disclose any of these records, except under the President's direction, until the President's term of office concludes. If a President serves consecutive terms, the Archivist does not disclose records without the President's direction until the end of the last term, or the end of another period if specified in 44 U.S.C. 2204 and subpart E of this part.

        § 1270.22   Designating a representative to act for a President.

#### § § 1270.22

        (a) Title 44 U.S.C. chapter 22 grants the President certain discretion and authority over Presidential records. An incumbent or former President may designate one or more representatives to exercise this discretion and authority, including in the event of the President's death or disability.

#### § § 1270.30

        An incumbent President may dispose of any Presidential records of their administration that, in the President's opinion, lack administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value, if the President obtains the Archivist's written views about the proposed disposal and either—

        (a) Those views state that the Archivist does not intend to request Congress's advice on the matter because the Archivist either does not consider the records proposed for disposal to be of special interest to Congress or does not consider it to be in the public interest to consult with Congress about the proposed disposal; or

        (b)(1) Those views state that the Archivist considers either that the records proposed for disposal may be of special interest to Congress or that consulting with Congress about the proposed disposal is in the public interest; and

        (2) The President submits copies of the proposed disposal schedule to the Senate and the House of Representatives at least 60 calendar days of continuous congressional session before the proposed disposal date. For the purpose of this section, a continuous congressional session breaks only when Congress adjourns  (with no date set to resume). If either House of Congress adjourns with a date set to resume, and breaks for more than three days, the adjourned days do not count when computing the 60-day timeline. The President submits copies of the proposed disposal schedule to the Senate Committees on Rules and Administration and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and to the House Committees on House Administration and Oversight and Government Reform.

        § 1270.32   Disposing of Presidential records in the Archivist's custody.

#### § § 1270.32

        (a) The Archivist may dispose of Presidential records in the Archivist's legal custody that the Archivist appraises and determines to have insufficient administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to warrant continuing to preserve them.

        (b) If the Archivist determines that Presidential records have insufficient value under paragraph (a) of this section, the Archivist publishes a proposed disposal notice in the  with a public comment period of at least 45 days. The notice describes the records the Archivist proposes to dispose of, the reason for disposing of them, and the projected earliest disposal date.

        (c) After the public comment period in paragraph (b) of this section, the Archivist publishes a final disposal notice in the  at least 60 calendar days before the earliest disposal date. The notice includes:

        (1) A reasonably specific description of the records scheduled for disposal;

        (2) The earliest disposal date; and

        (3) A concise statement of the reason for disposing of the records.

        (d) Publishing the notice required by paragraph (c) of this section in the  constitutes a final agency action for purposes of review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

#### § § 1270.38

        Public access to Presidential records generally begins five years after the President leaves office, and is administered through the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as modified by the Presidential Records Act (44 U.S.C. 2204(c)).

        § 1270.40   Restricting access to Presidential records.

#### § § 1270.40

        (a) An incumbent President may, prior to the end of the President's term of office or last consecutive term of office, restrict access to certain information within Presidential records created during their administration, for a period not to exceed 12 years after the President leaves office (in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2204).

        (b) If a President specifies such restrictions, the Archivist consults with that President or the President's designated representative to identify the affected records, or any reasonably segregable portion of them.

        (c) The Archivist then restricts public access to the identified records or the restricted information contained in them until the earliest of following occurs:

        (1) The restricting President waives the restriction, in whole or in part;

        (2) The restriction period in paragraph (a) of this section expires for the category of information; or

        (3) The Archivist determines that the restricting President or an agent of that President has published the restricted record, a reasonably segregable portion of the record, or any significant element or aspect of the information contained in the record, in the public domain.

        § 1270.42   Appealing restricted access.

#### § § 1270.42

        (a) If the Archivist denies a person access to a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it due to a restriction made under § 1270.40, that person may file an administrative appeal. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Library of the President during whose term of office the record was created, at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.3. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Vice Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Materials Division at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.1.

        (d) The director responds to the requester in writing and within 30 working days from the date they receive the appeal. The director's response states whether or not the director is granting access to the Presidential records and the basis for that decision. The director's decision to withhold release of Presidential records is final and is not subject to judicial review.

        § 1270.44   Exceptions to restricted access.

#### § § 1270.44

        (a) Even when a President imposes restrictions on access under § 1270.40, NARA still makes Presidential records of former Presidents available in the following instances, subject to any rights, defenses, or privileges which the United States or any agency or person may invoke:

        (1) To a court of competent jurisdiction in response to a properly issued subpoena or other judicial process, for the purposes of any civil or criminal investigation or proceeding;

        (2) To an incumbent President if the President seeks records that contain information they need to conduct current Presidential business and the information is not otherwise available;

        (3) To either House of Congress, or to a congressional committee or subcommittee, if the congressional entity seeks records that contain information it needs to conduct business within its jurisdiction and the information is not otherwise available; or

        (b) The President, either House of Congress, or a congressional committee or subcommittee must request the records they seek under paragraph (a) of this section from the Archivist in writing and, where practicable, identify the records with reasonable specificity.

        (c) The Archivist promptly notifies the President (or their representative) during whose term of office the record was created, and the incumbent President (or their representative) of a request for records under paragraph (a) of this section.

The incumbent or former President must personally make any decision to assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it.

        (e) The Archivist does not disclose a Presidential record or reasonably segregable part of a record if it is subject to a privilege claim asserted by the incumbent President unless:

        (1) The incumbent President withdraws the privilege claim; or

        (2) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to release the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.

        (f)(1) If a former President asserts the claim, the Archivist consults with the incumbent President, as soon as practicable and within 30 calendar days from the date that the Archivist receives notice of the claim, to determine whether the incumbent President will uphold the claim.

        (2) If the incumbent President upholds the claim asserted by the former President, the Archivist does not disclose the Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of the record unless:

        (i) The incumbent President withdraws the decision upholding the claim; or

        (ii) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to disclose the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.

        (3) If the incumbent President does not uphold the claim asserted by the former President, fails to decide before the end of the 30-day period detailed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or withdraws a decision upholding the claim, the Archivist discloses the Presidential record 60 calendar days after the Archivist received notification of the claim (or 60 days after the withdrawal) unless a court order in an action in any Federal court directs the Archivist to withhold the record, including an action initiated by the former President under 44 U.S.C. 2204(e).

        (g) The Archivist may adjust any time period or deadline under this subpart, as appropriate, to accommodate records requested under this section.

A President must assert their claim within 60 working days after the date of the Archivist's notice, and make the claim in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) If neither President asserts a claim within the 60-working-day period, the Archivist discloses the Presidential record covered by the notice.

        (d)(1) The incumbent or former President must personally make any decision to assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it.

        (2) The President must notify the Archivist, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, of a privilege claim under paragraph (a) of this section on the same day that the President asserts such a claim.

        (2) The Archivist notifies the former President and the public of the incumbent President's decision on the former President's claim no later than 30 calendar days after the Archivist receives notice of the claim.

        (i) The incumbent President withdraws the decision upholding the claim; or

        (ii) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to disclose the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.

        (4) If the incumbent President does not uphold the claim asserted by the former President, fails to decide before the end of the 30-day period detailed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or withdraws a decision upholding the claim, the Archivist discloses the Presidential record 90 calendar days after the Archivist received notification of the claim (or 90 days after the withdrawal) unless a court order in an action in any Federal court directs the Archivist to withhold the record, including an action initiated by the former President under 44 U.S.C. 2204(e).

        (f) The Archivist does not disclose a Presidential record or reasonably segregable part of a record if it is subject to a privilege claim asserted by the incumbent President unless:

        (1) The incumbent President withdraws the privilege claim; or

        (a) The Archivist requests specific guidance from the appropriate law enforcement agency when the Archivist is determining whether to release Presidential records compiled for law enforcement purposes that may be subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7). The Archivist requests guidance if:

        (1) No general guidance applies;

        (2) The record is particularly sensitive; or

        (3) The type of record or information is widespread throughout the files.

        (b) When the Archivist decides to release Presidential records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the Archivist notifies any agency that has provided guidance on those records under this section. The notice includes the following:

        (1) A description of the records in question;

        (2) A statement that the records described contain information compiled for law enforcement purposes and may be subject to the exemption provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) for records of this type; and

        In accordance with subpart B of this part, and subject to any rights, defenses, or privileges which the Federal Government or any person may invoke, the Presidential historical materials in the custody and control of the Archivist will be made available for use in any judicial proceeding and are subject to subpoena or other lawful process.

      Subpart D—Public Access to Materials

        § 1275.42   Processing.

#### § § 1275.42

        The archivists will conduct archival processing of all closed materials to prepare them for public access. In processing the materials, the archivists will give priority to segregating private or personal materials and transferring them to their proprietary or commemorative owners in accordance with § 1275.46. In conducting such archival processing, the archivists will restrict portions of the materials pursuant to §§ 1275.48 and 1275.50. All materials will be prepared for public access and released subject to restrictions or outstanding claims or petitions seeking such restrictions.

        § 1275.44   Segregating and reviewing.

#### § § 1275.44

        (a) During the processing period described in § 1275.42, the Archivist will assign archivists to segregate private or personal materials, as defined in § 1275.16(b). The archivists have sole responsibility for the initial review and determination of private or personal materials. At all times when the archivists or other authorized officials have access to the materials in accordance with these regulations, they will take all reasonable steps to minimize the degree of intrusion into private or personal materials. Except as provided in these regulations, the archivists or other authorized officials will not disclose to any person private or personal or otherwise restricted information learned as a result of their activities under these regulations.

        (b) During the processing period described in § 1275.42, the Archivist will assign archivists to segregate materials neither relating to abuses of governmental power, as defined in § 1275.16(c), nor otherwise having general historical significance, as defined in § 1275.16(d). The archivists have sole responsibility for the initial review and determination of those materials which are not related to abuses of governmental power and do not otherwise have general historical significance.

        (c) During the processing period described in § 1275.42, the Archivist will assign archivists to segregate materials subject to restriction, as prescribed in §§ 1275.48 and 1275.50. The archivists have sole responsibility for the initial review and determination of materials that should be restricted. The archivists insert a notification of withdrawal at the front of the file folder or container affected by the removal of restricted material. The notification includes a brief description of the restricted material and the basis for the restriction as prescribed in §§ 1275.48 and 1275.50.

        § 1275.46   Transfer of private or personal materials.

#### § § 1275.46

        (a) The Archivist will transfer sole custody and use of those materials determined to be private or personal, or to be neither related to abuses of governmental power nor otherwise of general historical significance, to Richard Nixon's heirs or to the former staff member who created the materials having primary proprietary or commemorative interest in the materials, or to their heir, designee, or assignee. Such materials include all segments of the original tape recordings that have been or will be identified as private or personal.

        (b) Materials determined to be neither related to abuses of governmental power nor otherwise of general historical significance, and transferred pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, will upon such transfer no longer be deemed Presidential historical materials as defined in § 1275.16(a).

        § 1275.48   Restriction of materials related to abuses of governmental power.

#### § § 1275.48

        (a) The Archivist will restrict access to materials determined during the processing period to relate to abuses of governmental power, as defined in § 1275.16(c), when:

        (1) Ordered by a court;

        (2) The release of the materials would violate a Federal statute; or

        (3) The materials are authorized under criteria established by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, provided that any question as to whether materials are in fact properly classified or are properly subject to classification will be resolved in accordance with the applicable executive order or as otherwise provided by law.

        (b) However, the Archivist may waive these restrictions when:

        (1) The requester is engaged in a hist_or_ical research project;

        (2) The requester is a former Federal official who had been appointed by President Nixon to a policymaking position _and_ who seeks access to only those classified materials which he originated, reviewed, signed, or received while in public office;

        (3) The requester has a security clearance equivalent to the highest degree of national security classification that may be applicable to any of the materials to be examined;

        (4) The Archivist has determined that the heads of agencies having subject matter interest in the material do not object to the granting of access to the materials;

        (5) The requester has signed a statement, which declares that the requester will not publish, disclose, or otherwise compromise the classified material to be examined and that the requester has been made aware of Federal criminal statutes which prohibit the compromise or disclosure of this information.

        (c) The Archivist will restrict access to any portion of materials determined to relate to abuses of governmental power when the release of those portions would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or constitute libel of a living person:  That if material related to an abuse of governmental power refers to, involves, or incorporates such personal information, the Archivist will make available such personal information, or portions thereof, if such personal information, or portions thereof, is essential to an understanding of the abuses of governmental power.

        § 1275.50   Restriction of materials of general historical significance unrelated to abuses of governmental power.

#### § § 1275.50

        (a) The Archivist will restrict access to materials determined during the processing period to be of general historical significance, but not related to abuses of governmental power, under one or more of the circumstances specified in § 1275.48(a).

        (b) The Archivist will also restrict access to materials of general historical significance, but not related to abuses of governmental power, when the release of these materials would:

        (1) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; or

        (2) Constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of a living person; or

        (3) Disclose investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only when the disclosure of such records would:

        (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

        (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

        (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

        (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source who furnished information on a confidential basis, and in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished by a confidential source;

        (v) Disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or

        (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.

        § 1275.52   Periodic review of restrictions.

#### § § 1275.52

        The Archivist periodically will assign archivists to review materials placed under restriction by § 1275.48 or § 1275.50 and to make available for public access those materials which, with the passage of time or other circumstances, no longer require restriction.

        § 1275.54   Appeal of restrictions.

#### § § 1275.54

        The Nixon Presidential Library controls the Nixon Presidential historical materials. Upon petition of any researcher who claims in writing to the library director that the restriction of specified materials is inappropriate and should be removed, the archivists will submit the pertinent materials, or representative examples of them, to the library director. The library director reviews the restricted materials, and consults with interested Federal agencies as necessary. To the extent these consultations require the transfer of copies of materials to Federal officials outside NARA, the library director will comply with the requirements of § 1275.32. As necessary and practicable, the library director will also seek the views of any person whose rights or privileges might be adversely affected by a decision to open the materials. The library director prepares a final written decision as to the continued restriction of all or part of the pertinent materials. The library director's decision constitutes the final administrative determination. The library director will notify the petitioner and other interested people of the final administrative determination within 60 calendar days following receipt of such petition.

        § 1275.56   Deleting restricted portions.

#### § § 1275.56

        The Archivist will provide a requester any reasonably segregable portions of otherwise restricted materials after NARA deletes the portions which are restricted under § 1275.48 or § 1275.50.

        § 1275.58   Requests for declassification.

#### § § 1275.58

        Challenges to the classification and requests for the declassification of national security classified materials are governed by the provisions of 36 CFR part 1256, subpart E, as that may be amended from time to time.

        § 1275.60   Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

#### § § 1275.60

        (a) The Archivist will process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for access to only those materials within the Presidential historical materials that are identifiable by an archivist as records of an agency as defined in § 1275.16(f). The Archivist will process these requests in accordance with the FOIA regulations set forth in 36 CFR part 1250, NARA Records Subject to FOIA.

        (b) In order to allow NARA archivists to devote as much time and effort as possible to the processing of materials for general public access, the Archivist will not process those FOIA requests where the requester can reasonably obtain the same materials through a request directed to an agency (as defined in § 1275.16(f)), unless the requester demonstrates that he or she has unsuccessfully sought access from that agency or its successor in law or function.

          (a)  Some NARA facilities are located on property the United States owns or that is otherwise under the control of the Archivist of the United States (“NARA property”), other facilities are leased by NARA directly using authority delegated by the General Services Administration (GSA), and still others are located on property owned, leased by, or otherwise under GSA's control (“GSA property”), or owned and under the control of the Government Publishing Office (“GPO property”).

          (b)  You must comply with the rules in this part when you are on NARA property or using facilities located on _NARA property._

          (1)  The National Archives Building in Washington, DC, is NARA property and NARA's control includes:

These Federal records centers are listed in 36 CFR 1253.4 and archival facilities are listed in 36 CFR 1253.5.

          (c)  (1) The following NARA facilities are located on GSA property: All Federal records centers listed at 36 CFR 1253.4, except the Federal records centers listed in 36 CFR 1280.1(b)(3), and all archival research rooms and facilities listed at 36 CFR 1253.5, except the National Archives at Atlanta and the archival facilities listed in 36 CFR 1280.1(b)(3).

Due to dangers that smoking and smoking devices present to the safety of occupants and the security of archival holdings, we have a zero-tolerance policy. You may smoke and use alternative smoking devices only in marked smoking areas outside certain NARA facilities.

      Subpart C—Additional Rules for Using Public Areas of NARA Property or Facilities

        § 1280.60   Permitting use of public areas.

#### § § 1280.60

        (a) The primary use for NARA property and facilities, including those areas open to the public, is conducting official NARA business. NARA's official business includes educational and public programs and other activities we conduct on our own or in conjunction with government organizations, the National Archives Foundation (“Foundation”) and Presidential library foundations, or other private organizations. NARA uses all of the public areas of NARA property and facilities in the course of conducting official business.

        (b) We may permit, under the conditions described in this subpart, Federal agencies, quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal government organizations to occasionally use certain public areas for official activities (“government organization use”).

        (c) We may also permit occasional, non-official use of specified public areas for private group activities and events that relate to or further NARA's archival, records, or other interests. The authorities for such use are 44 U.S.C. 2112(e) (for Presidential libraries) and 44 U.S.C. 2903(b) (for other NARA property and facilities).

        (1) Examples of private use that relate to or further NARA's archival, records, or other interests include, but are not limited to: Meetings and other business activities held by archival, historical, or other professional organizations with a connection to NARA's holdings or mission; activities or events that promote research in, or use or preservation of, NARA holdings; invitation-only screening of film or TV premieres when NARA holdings have been used in the production or when the screening otherwise promotes use of NARA holdings ( documentary film premiere); and dinners, receptions, or other private group events where the connection to NARA is the location itself ( The National Archives Building or a Presidential library) or the opportunity to view NARA exhibits. Private group events may include events of a personal or social nature, such as weddings and wedding receptions, and school-sponsored activities.

        (2) Each NARA facility with public use space determines whether and what kind of events of a personal nature the facility can support, given the size and configuration of available space, staff availability, and other logistical factors. We also reserve the right to limit the number and size of personal celebrations, and to limit or prohibit activities as part of a private group event that pose a risk to the facility, property, people, or our holdings. If you are interested in holding a private group event at a NARA facility, contact that facility directly for more information. See 36 CFR part 1253 for facility listings and contact information.

        (3) We may charge fees for private group and government organization use of these public areas and the services related to such use. See § 1280.68. NARA, the Foundation, or Presidential library foundations may collect the fees.

        § 1280.62   General rules when using public areas.

#### § § 1280.62

        In addition to the rules listed in subparts A and B of this part, the following rules apply to all government organization and private group use of NARA public areas:

        (a) You may not characterize your use of NARA property or facilities as an endorsement by NARA of your organization or its activities, or otherwise suggest an official relationship between NARA and your organization if such a relationship does not exist.

        (b) You may not charge or collect admission fees, or money for other purposes, at the event.

        (c) You may not use NARA property, facilities, or permission to use a NARA property or facility for any activities that involve:

        (1) Profit-making;

        (2) Advertising, promoting, or selling commercial enterprises, products, or services;

        (3) Partisan political activities;

        (4) Sectarian or other similar activities; or

        (5) Any use inconsistent with those authorized in this section.

        (d) You may not use NARA property or facilities if you or your organization or group engage in discriminatory practices proscribed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.

        (e) You may not misrepresent your identity to the public or conduct any activities in a misleading or fraudulent manner.

        (f) You must ensure that no Government property is destroyed, displaced, or damaged during your use of NARA public areas. You must take prompt action to replace, return, restore, repair, or repay NARA for any damage caused to Government property during your use of NARA facilities or property, and the facility director may charge additional fees to recoup the cost of any damage that occurs due to your use of the property or facility.

        § 1280.64   Requesting to use our public areas.

#### § § 1280.64

        (a) This section provides a general description of the process that different NARA facilities use to review and respond to requests to use their public areas. You should contact a facility before submitting a formal request, to check on availability and to obtain any forms, procedures, or rules that are specific to that facility.

        (b)  (1) If you are interested in hosting an official governmental event or meeting at the National Archives Building, you should contact NARA Special Events by phone at 202.357.5164 or by email at  If you are interested in hosting a private group event at the National Archives Building, you should contact the National Archives Foundation by phone at 202.357.5404, toll-free at 844.723.2155, or by email at  Additional information is in subpart D of this part and online at

        (2) If you are interested in hosting an event or meeting at the National Archives at College Park, you should contact NARA Special Events by phone at 301.837.1504 or by email at  Additional information is in subpart D of this part.

        (3) You will need to submit a written request at least 30 calendar days before the proposed date of your event. Your request will need to include such information as the name of your group and any other organization that is participating, point-of-contact information, the date and time you are requesting, number of attendees, type of event, description of the event, other arrangements you would like to include, and other information about the event to enable us to determine whether we can accommodate it. We may also request additional information. OMB control number 3095-0043 covers this information collection.

        (c)  (1) You should contact the Presidential library and museum where you wish to hold your event (see contact information in 36 CFR 1253.3).

        (2) Depending on what kind of event you want to host, you may be referred to the foundation that supports the library to make the event arrangements and to pay any event fees and costs that apply. Some Presidential libraries are located at shared-use facilities where their library foundations own certain areas and spaces used for private group events and operate those areas and spaces under their rules rather than the rules in this part 1280.

        (3) For events held in Presidential library areas or spaces that are considered NARA property, you will need to submit a written, signed request to the library you wish to use (see  for the address) and complete NA Form 16011, Application for Use of Space in Presidential Libraries. OMB control number 3095-0024 covers this information collection.

        (d)  (1) Most archival research facilities and the FRCs do not have any public use areas or spaces.

        (2) If you wish to request use of public areas at an archival research facility, you must submit a written, signed request to the director of the facility you wish to use (see  for a list of addresses) at least 30 days before the proposed date of your event. GSA's rules for requesting use of the facility will also apply if the facility is located on GSA property (see 41 CFR part 102-74, subpart D, Occasional Use of Public Buildings).

        (3) Your request will need to include such information as the name of your group and any other organization that is participating, point-of-contact information, the date and time you are requesting, number of attendees, type of event, description of the event, and other information about the event to enable us to determine whether we can accommodate it. We may also request additional information. OMB control number 3095-0043 covers this information collection.

        (e)  None of the NARA facilities that are located on GPO property have spaces available for public use.

        § 1280.66   How we handle requests to use public areas.

#### § § 1280.66

        (a) When you ask to use NARA property, we review your request to:

        (1) Ensure that it meets all of the provisions in this subpart and subpart D of this part;

        (2) Determine if the public area you have requested is available on the date and time you have requested;

        (3) Evaluate whether the requested space can accommodate your proposed use; and

        (4) Determine the fees and costs we will charge for the event.

        (b) When we have completed this review, we will notify you of the decision. We may ask for additional information before deciding whether or not to approve your event.

        (c) We reserve the right to review, reject, or require changes in any material, activity, or caterer you intend to use for the event.

        § 1280.68   Fees for using public areas.

#### § § 1280.68

        (a) We are authorized to charge fees for occasional, non-official use of NARA public areas, as well as for services related to such use, including additional cleaning, security, and other staff services. We will either exercise this authority directly, or through the Foundation or an authorized Presidential library foundation or support organization.

        (b) Federal and quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal governmental institutions using public space for official government functions pay fees for the costs of room rental, administrative fees, additional cleaning, security, and other staff services NARA provides.

        (c) You will be informed in advance and in writing of the total estimated cost associated with using the public area of interest. If we collect the fees directly, you will pay the National Archives Trust Fund. If the Foundation collects the fees, you will pay the National Archives Foundation. If a Presidential library foundation collects the fees, they will inform you where to submit the payment.

        § 1280.70   Additional rules that apply to approved events.

#### § § 1280.70

        (a) Once we approve your event, you must provide any support people you need to register guests, distribute approved literature, name tags, and other material.

        (b) We must approve in advance any item that you plan to distribute or display during your use of NARA property or facilities, or any notice or advertisement that refers, directly or indirectly, to NARA, the Foundation, a Presidential foundation or supporting organization, or the National Archives Trust Fund, or incorporates any of NARA's logos or seals (see 36 CFR 1200.2).

        (c) We must approve in advance any vendor or caterer who will work in NARA facilities. You must comply with all NARA requirements for the use of food and drink at your event.

        (d) You may not allow or consume food or drink in areas where original records or historical materials are displayed.

      § 1281.3   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 1281.3

      The following definitions apply to this part:

      This term refers to the document cited in § 1281.4.

      The term means arranging, describing, reviewing, preserving, reproducing, restoring, exhibiting, and making available Presidential and other records and historical materials in the care and custody of the Presidential libraries, and includes the salaries and expenses of NARA personnel performing those functions.

      This term means a Presidential library that is subject to the endowment requirements of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g). The term includes the existing libraries of presidents who took the oath of office as President for the first time on or after January 20, 1985, the proposed library of President George W. Bush, and the libraries of presidents who take the oath of office as President for the first time on or after July 1, 2002.

      As used in this part, the term means operating equipment that must be furnished with the new library and included in the calculation of the required endowment. Operating equipment is fundamental to the operation of the library and is normally built into the facility or permanently mounted to the structure.

      This term means a Presidential library that has been accepted by the Archivist under 44 U.S.C. 2112(a) and established as part of the system of Presidential libraries managed by NARA.

      This term means those activities, including administrative services, involved with maintaining, operating, protecting, and improving a Presidential library.

      This term means a private organization organized under state law to construct a new Presidential library. The term usually refers to nonprofit charitable organizations that meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 CFR 501(c)(3)). The term specifically includes “foundation” and “institute,” as those terms are used in 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(1)(B).

      The term “historical materials” has the meaning set forth at 44 U.S.C. 2101.

      This term means a Presidential library for a President who took the oath of office as President for the first time on or after January 20, 1985, that has not been accepted by the Archivist under 44 U.S.C. 2112(a). Presidential libraries that have been accepted by the Archivist and established as part of the system of Presidential libraries that are managed by NARA are “existing libraries.”

      This term means any addition of square footage, as defined by the BOMA Standard (incorporated by reference in § 1281.2) or any physical or material change to the existing structure of an existing library that results in a significant increase in the cost of facility operations.

      This term means a Presidential archival depository as defined in 44 U.S.C. 2101.

      The term has the meaning set forth at 44 U.S.C. 2201.

      § 1281.4   What are the architectural and design standards for Presidential libraries?

#### § § 1281.4

      The Archivist is required by 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(2) to promulgate architectural and design standards for Presidential libraries. The standards address the architectural, design, and structural requirements of a new Presidential library and additions or renovations, and they ensure that Presidential libraries are safe and efficient to operate and provide adequate and secure research and museum facilities. A copy of the standards is provided to the foundation upon request and is available from the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001.

      § 1281.6   What certifications must be provided to NARA?

#### § § 1281.6

      (a) The foundation must provide to NARA design and construction certifications specified in the architectural and design standards.

      (b) Any item that NARA finds is not in compliance with the architectural and design standards must be corrected by the foundation or, if not corrected by the foundation, will be corrected by NARA with the foundation paying the full cost of taking necessary corrective action.

      § 1281.8   What information must be provided to NARA for its report to Congress on a new Presidential library facility?

#### § § 1281.8

      (a) NARA must submit a report to Congress on a proposed new library pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). The foundation that is building the library must help NARA as necessary in compiling the information needed for this report. If a State, political subdivision, university, institution of higher learning, or institute participates in the construction of the new library (e.g., by making land available for the facility), that party is subject to the same requirement. Requested information must be sent to the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001 far enough in advance of the anticipated date of transfer of the Library for NARA to compile and submit the report so that it may lie before Congress for the minimum time period specified in 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(5). The normal lead time for submitting the required information is a least six months in advance of the anticipated date of transfer, but the submission date is subject to negotiation between NARA and the foundation in specific cases. The collection of information by NARA for these purposes has been approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0036.

      (b) Paragraph (a)(3) of 44 U.S.C. 2112 lists the information that NARA must include in its report to Congress. The foundation and NARA will agree as part of the planning process for a new library on what information the foundation will provide and when. The same requirement applies to other entities involved in the construction of a new library (e.g., a local government or university).

      A foundation must consult with the Office of Presidential Libraries before beginning the process of offering a gift for the purpose of making a physical or material change or addition to a new or existing library. NARA will furnish the interested foundation the current architectural and design standards as specified in § 1281.4. Others may request a single copy by writing the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.

      § 1281.12   What information must be provided to NARA for its report to Congress on a change or addition to a Presidential library facility?

#### § § 1281.12

      (a) NARA must submit a report to Congress on a proposed physical or material change or addition to an existing library that is being funded wholly by gift. The foundation or other party offering the gift to NARA must help NARA as necessary in compiling the information needed for the report. Required information must be sent to the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001, far enough in advance of the Archivist's acceptance of the gift for NARA to compile and submit the report to Congress in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(5). The normal lead time for submitting the required information on physical or material changes or additions is at least nine (9) months in advance of the anticipated date that work will begin on the physical or material change or addition to the library. The collection of information contained in this section has been approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0036.

      (b) Paragraph (a)(4) of 44 U.S.C. 2112 lists the information that NARA must include in its report to Congress.

      (4) A written certification that the library and the equipment therein will comply with NARA standards after the change or addition is made.

      § 1281.14   What type of endowment is required for a Presidential library?

#### § § 1281.14

      (a)  The foundation or organization that is offering NARA a new Presidential library must establish an endowment for the library, by gift or bequest, in the National Archives Trust Fund before the Archivist may accept the transfer of the library. The purpose of the endowment is to help NARA defray the cost of facility operations. The endowment requirement for the prospective new library of President George W. Bush is set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g). The endowment requirements for the new libraries of presidents taking the oath of office from the first time on or after July 1, 2002, are set forth in paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g).

      (b)  For a proposed physical or material change or addition to an endowment library that is being funded wholly by gift, the foundation or other organization that is offering the gift must agree, as a condition of the gift, to transfer monies by gift or bequest to the library's existing endowment in the National Archives Trust Fund in an amount sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g). The Archivist must determine that the additional endowment monies have been transferred to the Trust Fund before he accepts the gift of the physical or material change or addition.

      (c)  The income from a library's endowment is available to cover the cost of facility operations, but is not available for the performance of archival functions.

      (d)  The formulas for calculating the required endowment are set forth in 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3)-(5).

      (e)  The cost of all operating equipment provided with a new library must be included in the endowment calculation pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3). The Archivist will provide in the architectural and design standards, a list of equipment guidelines, recommendations, and minimum requirements for a foundation's use in designing and building a new library. The list is not exhaustive and requirements may change with evolving technology, program requirements, and the final library design.

      (f)  For endowment purposes, the construction cost of a shared use library building containing both NARA and Foundation-controlled areas will be determined using the following formula: The percentage of the usable square footage of the NARA-controlled areas to the usable square footage of the entire building multiplied by the cost of the entire building. That figure is then used in calculating a library's endowment as specified by subsection (d) of this section and 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3)-(5).

      § 1281.16   What standard does NARA use for measuring building size?

#### § § 1281.16

      For purposes of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3) and (4), and this part, NARA has adopted the BOMA Standard (incorporated by reference in § 1281.2) as the standard for measuring the size of the facility and the value for calculating the endowment. The architectural and design standards contain the description of the area to be measured as to obtain the useable square footage and the exclusions to the measurement.
