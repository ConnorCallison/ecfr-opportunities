**Authority:** Authority: 28 U.S.C. 510; 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 28 CFR 0.75(j) and 0.76(j).

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 47118, Aug. 2, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart 2801.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance

        2801.101   Purpose.

#### § 2801.101

        (a) The Justice Acquisition Regulation (JAR) provides agency guidance, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 1.301(a)(2), and establishes, in this chapter, procurement regulations that supplement the FAR, 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter 1, and must be utilized conjunction with the FAR.

        (b)(1) The JAR contains Department of Justice (DOJ) policies that govern DOJ's acquisition process or otherwise control acquisition relationships between DOJ's contracting activities and contractors. The JAR contains—

        (i) Requirements of law;

        (ii) Deviations from the FAR requirements; and

        (iii) Policies that either have a significant effect beyond the internal procedures of DOJ or a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.

        (2) Relevant internal DOJ policies, procedures, guidance, and information not meeting the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are issued by DOJ in other announcements, internal policies, procedures, or guidance.

        2801.105   Issuance.

#### § 2801.105

        2801.105-2   Arrangement of regulation.

#### § 2801.105-2

        The JAR is subdivided into parts, which correspond to FAR parts. The numbering system permits the discrete identification of every JAR paragraph. This numbering system permits immediate identification of each JAR part with coverage of the same subject matter and same numbering system as in the FAR. Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR is identified by a numerical suffix of 70 or higher in the final position of the reference number.

        2801.106   OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § 2801.106

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320, require that reporting and recordkeeping requirements affecting ten (10) or more members of the public be cleared by OMB. The OMB control number for the collection of information under this chapter is 1103-0018.

      Subpart 2801.3—Agency Acquisition Regulations

        2801.304   Agency control and compliance procedures.

#### § 2801.304

        Pursuant to FAR 1.304, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is responsible for ensuring that bureau acquisition guidance and directives do not restrain the flexibilities found in the FAR. For this reason, bureaus shall forward any bureau acquisition guidance to the SPE upon issuance. The SPE has the authority to revoke any guidance or directive considered restrictive of the regulations found in the FAR.

      Subpart 2801.4—Deviations From the FAR and JAR

        2801.403   Individual deviations.

#### § 2801.403

        Individual deviations from the FAR or the JAR that affect only one contract action shall be approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) or designee.

        2801.404   Class deviations.

#### § 2801.404

        Requests for class deviations from the FAR or JAR shall be submitted to the SPE. The SPE will consult with the chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC), as appropriate, and send his/her recommendations to the Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO). The CAO will grant or deny requests for such deviations. Requests for deviations involving basic ordering agreements, master type contracts, or situations where multiple awards are made from one solicitation are considered to involve more than one contract and, therefore, are considered class deviation requests.

        2801.404-70   Requests for class deviations.

#### § 2801.404-70

        Requests for approval of class deviations from the FAR or the JAR, for any solicitation that will result in multiple awards, shall be forwarded to the SPE. Such requests will be signed by the Bureau Procurement Chief (BPC).

      Subpart 2801.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities

        (b) The head of the agency has determined that the filing of information returns, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6050M, on confidential contracts, which involve law enforcement or foreign counterintelligence activities, would interfere with the effective conduct of those confidential law enforcement or foreign counterintelligence activities, and that the special reporting exceptions added to 26 U.S.C. 6050M by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 apply to these types of contracts.

        (c)  means an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

        (4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the Deciding Official.

        (e) Upon receipt of a protest by the agency, the contracting officer, even when not serving as the Deciding Official, will notify other vendors competing in the procurement of the protest, any stay of award or suspension of performance, and/or any determination under FAR 33.103(f)(1) or (3) if and when made.

        (f) Intervenors to the protest are not permitted.

        (g) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to a decision by the contracting officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from a contracting officer's decision on an agency protest and a decision by the Agency Protest Official is final and not appealable.

        (h) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. DOJ procedures do not provide for any discovery. The Deciding Official has discretion to request additional information from the agency or the protestor.

        (i) A protestor may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. DOJ will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees or costs related to the agency protest.

        (j) If an agency protest is received before contract award, the contracting officer shall not make award unless the HCA or designee makes a determination to proceed under FAR 33.103(f)(1). Similarly, if an agency protest is filed within ten (10) days after award or within 5 days after a debriefing date has been offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request under FAR 15.505 or 15.506, whichever is later, the contracting officer shall suspend contract performance unless the HCA or designee makes a determination to proceed under FAR 33.103(f)(3). Any stay of award or suspension of performance remains in effect until the agency protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.

        (k) The deciding official's decision may be oral or written. If oral, the deciding official shall send a confirming letter after the decision using a means that allows proof of receipt, including electronic mail. The letter shall:

        (1) State whether the protest was denied, sustained, or dismissed;

        (2) Indicate the date the decision was provided; and

        (3) Provide the rationale for the decision.

        (l) If the deciding official sustains the protest, relief may consist of any of the following:

        (1) Termination of the contract for convenience or cause.

        (2) Recompeting the requirement.

        (3) Amending the solicitation.

        (4) Refraining from exercising contract options.

        (5) Reevaluating the offers or bids and making a new award determination.

        (6) Other action that the deciding official determines is appropriate.

        (m) Proceedings on an agency protest shall be dismissed if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside of DOJ.
