      (iii)(A) For trading in a security in a jurisdiction other than the United States, the method to be used to determine the dollar value of ADTV as of the preceding 6 full calendar months is to sum the value in U.S. dollars of all reported transactions in such security in such jurisdiction for each trading day during the preceding 6 full calendar months, and to divide this sum by the total number of trading days in such jurisdiction during the preceding 6 full calendar months.

      (B) If the value of reported transactions used in calculating the ADTV of securities under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) is reported in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the total value of each day's transactions in such currency shall be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of a spot rate of exchange for that day obtained from at least one independent entity that provides or disseminates foreign exchange quotations in the ordinary course of its business.

      § 41.25   Additional conditions for trading for security futures products.

#### § § 41.25

      (a)  For purposes of this section:

      means the quantity of the security underlying a security futures product that reasonably can be expected to be readily available to short traders and salable by long traders at its market value in normal cash marketing channels during the specified delivery period. For guidance on estimating deliverable supply, designated contract markets may refer to appendix A of this subpart.

      means the aggregate of long positions in physically-delivered security futures products and cash-settled security futures products, in the same security, and, separately, the aggregate of short positions in physically-delivered security futures products and cash-settled security futures products, in the same security.

      (b) —(1)  The designated contract market shall comply with part 16 of this chapter requiring the daily reporting of market data.

      (2)  The rules of a designated contract market that lists or trades one or more security futures products must include the following provisions:

      (i) Trading of a security futures product based on a single security shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for the underlying security; and

      (ii) Trading of a security futures product based on a narrow-based security index shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for one or more underlying securities that constitute 50 percent or more of the market capitalization of the narrow-based security index.

      (3)  A designated contract market shall have rules in place establishing position limits or position accountability procedures for the expiring futures contract month as specified in this paragraph (b)(3).

      (i)  For a security futures product on a single equity security, including a security futures product on an underlying security that represents ownership in a group of securities, e.g., an exchange traded fund, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit no greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; except where:

      (A) For a security futures product on a single equity security where the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares, a designated contract market may adopt, if appropriate in light of the liquidity of trading in the underlying security, a position limit no greater than the equivalent of 12.5 percent of the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; or

      (B) For a security futures product on a single equity security where the six-month total trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 2.5 billion shares and there are more than 40 million shares of estimated deliverable supply, a designated contract market may adopt a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. Upon request by a designated contract market, traders who hold positions greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), or such lower level specified pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, must provide information to the designated contract market and consent to halt increasing their positions when so ordered by the designated contract market.

      (ii)  For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security, e.g., a basket of deliverable securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month and the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must apply to the underlying security with the lowest estimated deliverable supply. For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security with a contract size different than 100 shares per underlying security, an appropriate adjustment to the limit must be made. If each of the underlying equity securities in the basket of deliverable securities is eligible for a position accountability level under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, then the security futures product is eligible for a position accountability level in lieu of position limits.

      (iii)  For a security futures product cash settled to a narrow-based security index of equity securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. For guidance on setting limits for a cash-settled equity index security futures product, designated contract markets may refer to paragraph (b) of appendix A to this subpart.

      (iv)  For a security futures product on one or more debt securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. For guidance on setting limits for a debt security futures product, designated contract markets may refer to paragraph (c) of appendix A to this subpart.

      (v)  For position limits required under this section where the security futures product permits delivery before the termination of trading, a designated contract market shall apply such position limits for a period beginning no later than the first day that long position holders may be assigned delivery notices, if such period is longer than the last three trading days of an expiring contract month.

      (vi)  A designated contract market shall calculate estimated deliverable supply and six-month total trading volume no less frequently than semi-annually.

      (A) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a lower speculative limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall lower the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security futures product, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; provided, that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.

      (B) If the estimated deliverable supply or six-month total trading volume data no longer supports a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall establish a position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.

      (C) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a higher speculative limit for a security futures product, as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, then the designated contract market may raise the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.

      (vii)  If the designated contract market lists both physically-delivered contracts and cash-settled contracts in the same security, it shall not permit netting of positions in the physically-delivered contract with that of the cash-settled contract for purposes of determining applicability of position limits.

      (c)  (1) The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities;

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if an opening price for one or more securities underlying a security futures product is not readily available, the final settlement price of the security futures product shall fairly reflect:

      (i) The price of the underlying security or securities during the most recent regular trading session for such security or securities; or

      (ii) The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.

      (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.

      (d)  For security futures products settled by actual delivery of the underlying security or securities, payment and delivery of the underlying security or securities must be effected through a clearing agency that is registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      (e)  The Commission may exempt a designated contract market from the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall not operate as an exemption from any Securities and Exchange Commission rule. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      § 41.27   Prohibition of dual trading in security futures products by floor brokers.

#### § § 41.27

      (a)  For purposes of this section:

      (1) Trading session means hours during which a designated contract market is scheduled to trade continuously during a trading day, as set forth in its rules, including any related post settlement trading session. A designated contract market may have more than one trading session during a trading day.

      (2) Member shall have the meaning set forth in section 1a(24) of the Act.

      (3) Broker association includes two or more designated contract market members with floor trading privileges of whom at least one is acting as a floor broker who:

      (i) Engage in floor brokerage activity on behalf of the same employer;

      (ii) Have an employer and employee relationship which relates to floor brokerage activity;

      (iii) Share profits and losses associated with their brokerage or trading activity; or

      (iv) Regularly share a deck of orders.

      (4) Customer means an account owner for which a trade is executed other than:

      (i) An account in which such floor broker has any interest;

      (ii) An account for which a floor broker has discretion;

      (iii) An account controlled by a person with whom a floor broker has a relationship through membership in a broker association;

      (iv) A house account of the floor broker's clearing member; or

      (v) An account for another member present on the floor of a designated contract market or an account controlled by such other member.

      (5) Dual trading means the execution of customer orders by a floor broker through open outcry during the same trading session in which the floor broker executes directly or by initiating and passing to another member, either through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers pursuant to a predetermined algorithm, a transaction for the same security futures product on the same designated contract market for an account described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.

      (b)  (1) No floor broker shall engage in dual trading in a security futures product on a designated contract market, except as otherwise provided under paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.

      (2) A designated contract market operating an electronic market or electronic trading system that provides market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm must submit an appropriate rule proposal to the Commission consistent with the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The proposed rule must prohibit electronic market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm from trading a security futures product for accounts in which these same participants have any interest during the same trading session that they also trade the same security futures product for other accounts. This paragraph, however, is not applicable with respect to execution priorities or quantity guarantees granted to market makers who perform that function, or to market participants who receive execution priorities based on price improvement activity, in accordance with the rules governing the designated contract market.

      (c) —(1)  Prior to listing a security futures product for trading on a trading floor where bids and offers are executed through open outcry, a designated contract market:

      (i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule prohibiting dual trading, together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or

      (ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (d)  Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market pursuant to one or more of the following specific exceptions:

      (1)  To offset trading errors resulting from the execution of customer orders,  that the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers as soon as practicable, but, except as provided herein, not later than the close of business on the business day following the discovery of error. In the event that a floor broker is unable to offset the error trade because the daily price fluctuation limit is reached, a trading halt is imposed by the designated contract market, or an emergency is declared pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error as soon as practicable thereafter.

      (2)  To permit a customer to designate in writing not less than once annually a specifically identified floor broker to dual trade while executing orders for such customer's account. An account controller acting pursuant to a power of attorney may designate a dual trading broker on behalf of its customer, provided, that the customer explicitly grants in writing to the individual account controller the authority to select a dual trading broker.

      (3)  To permit a broker who unsuccessfully attempts to leg into a spread transaction for a customer to take the executed leg into his or her personal account and to offset such position, provided, that a record is prepared and maintained to demonstrate that the customer order was for a spread.

      (4)  To address emergency market conditions resulting in a temporary emergency action as determined by a designated contract market.

      (e) —(1)  Prior to permitting dual trading under any of the exceptions provided in paragraphs (d)(1)-(4) of this section, a designated contract market:

      (i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule permitting the exception(s), together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or

      (ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (f)  Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market to address unique or special characteristics of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market as provided herein. Any rule of a designated contract market that would permit dual trading when it would otherwise be prohibited, based on a unique or special characteristic of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market must be submitted to the Commission for prior approval under the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The rule submission must include a detailed demonstration of why an exception is warranted.

#### § § 41.41

      (a)  (1) A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Securities Exchange Act”) (“Full FCM/Full BD”) may hold all of a customer's security futures products in a futures account, all of a customer's security futures products in a securities account, or some of a customer's security futures products in a futures account and other security futures products of the same customer in a securities account. A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(2) of the CEA (a notice-registered FCM) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a securities account. A person registered with the SEC as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act (a notice-registered broker-dealer) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a futures account.

      (2) A Full FCM/Full BD shall establish written policies or procedures for determining whether customer security futures products will be placed in a futures account and/or a securities account and, if applicable, the process by which a customer may elect the type or types of account in which security futures products will be held (including the procedure to be followed if a customer fails to make an election of account type).

      (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), before a futures commission merchant accepts the first order for a security futures product from or on behalf of a customer, the firm shall furnish the customer with a disclosure document containing the following information:

      (i) A description of the protections provided by the requirements set forth under section 4d of the CEA applicable to a futures account;

      (ii) A description of the protections provided by the requirements set forth under Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 applicable to a securities account;

      (iii) A statement indicating whether the customer's security futures products will be held in a futures account and/or a securities account, or whether the firm permits customers to make or change an election of account type; and

      (iv) A statement that, with respect to holding the customer's security futures products in a securities account or a futures account, the alternative regulatory scheme is not available to the customer in connection with that account.

      (2) Where a customer account containing an open security futures product position is transferred to a futures commission merchant, that futures commission merchant may instead provide the statements described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) above no later than ten business days after the date the account is transferred.

      (c)  A Full FCM/Full BD may change the type of account in which a customer's security futures products will be held; provided, that:

      (1) The firm creates a record of each change in account type, including the name of the customer, the account number, the date the firm received the customer's request to change the account type, if applicable, and the date the change in account type became effective; and

      (2) The firm, at least ten business days before the customer's account type is changed:

      (i) Notifies the customer in writing of the date that the change will become effective; and

      (ii) Provides the customer with the disclosures described in paragraph (b)(1) above.

      (d)  The Commission's recordkeeping rules set forth in §§ 1.31, 1.32, 1.35, 1.36, 1.37, 4.23, 4.33, and 18.05 of this chapter shall apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a futures account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter). The rules in the preceding sentence shall not apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a securities account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter); provided, that the SEC's recordkeeping rules apply to those transactions and positions.

      (e)  The Commission's reporting requirements set forth in §§ 1.33 and 1.46 of this chapter shall apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a futures account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter). These rules shall not apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a securities account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter);  that the SEC's rules set forth in §§ 240.10b-10 and 240.15c3-2 of this chapter regarding delivery of confirmations and account statements apply to those transactions and positions.

      (f)  All money, securities, or property held to margin, guarantee or secure security futures products held in a futures account, or accruing to customers as a result of such products, are subject to the segregation requirements of section 4d of the CEA and the rules thereunder.

The principal purpose of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) is to regulate customer margin collected by brokers, dealers, and members of national securities exchanges, including futures commission merchants required to register as brokers or dealers under section 15(b)(11) of the Exchange Act, relating to security futures.

      (b)  This Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) shall be jointly interpreted by the SEC and the Commission, consistent with the criteria set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and the provisions of Regulation T (12 CFR part 220).

      (c)  (1) This Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) does not preclude a self-regulatory authority, under rules that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act or section 19(b)(7) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), or a security futures intermediary from imposing additional margin requirements on security futures, including higher initial or maintenance margin levels, consistent with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), or from taking appropriate action to preserve its financial integrity.

      (2) This Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) does not apply to:

      (i) Financial relations between a customer and a security futures intermediary to the extent that they comply with a portfolio margining system under rules that meet the criteria set forth in section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act;

      (iii) Margin requirements that clearing agencies registered under section 17A of the Exchange Act or derivatives clearing organizations registered under section 5b of the Act impose on their members;

      (iv) Financial relations between a security futures intermediary and a person based on a good faith determination by the security futures intermediary that such person is an exempted person; and

      (v) Financial relations between a security futures intermediary and, or arranged by a security futures intermediary for, a person relating to trading in security futures by such person for its own account, if such person:

      (A) Is a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Exchange Act; and

      (B) Is registered with such exchange or such association as a security futures dealer pursuant to rules that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act, that:

      () Require such member to be registered as a floor trader or a floor broker with the Commission under section 4f(a)(_1_) of the Act, or as a dealer with the SEC under section 15(b) of the Exchange Act;

      () Require such member to maintain records sufficient to prove compliance with this paragraph (c)(_2_)(v) and the rules of the exchange or association of which it is a member;

      () Require such member to hold itself out as being willing to buy and sell security futures for its own account on a regular or continuous basis; and

      () Provide for disciplinary action, including revocation of such member's registration as a security futures dealer, for such member's failure to comply with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ _4_1.42 through 41.49) or the rules of the exchange or association.

      (d)  The Commission may exempt, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, financial relations involving any security futures intermediary, customer, position, or transaction, or any class of security futures intermediaries, customers, positions, or transactions, from one or more requirements of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any SEC rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the SEC.

      § 41.44   General provisions.

#### § § 41.44

      (a)  Except to the extent inconsistent with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49):

      (1) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a securities account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with Regulation T and the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.

      (2) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a futures account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.

      (b)  (1) The requirements for security futures and related positions in one account may not be met by considering items in any other account, except as permitted or required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or applicable margin rules. If withdrawals of cash, securities or other assets deposited as margin are permitted under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), bookkeeping entries shall be made when such cash, securities, or assets are used for purposes of meeting requirements in another account.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the security futures intermediary shall consider all futures accounts in which security futures and related positions are held that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer to be a single account for purposes of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49). The security futures intermediary may combine such accounts with other futures accounts that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer for purposes of computing a customer's overall margin requirement, as permitted or required by applicable margin rules.

      (c)  If a partner of the security futures intermediary has an account with the security futures intermediary in which security futures or related positions are held, the security futures intermediary shall disregard the partner's financial relations with the firm (as shown in the partner's capital and ordinary drawing accounts) in calculating the margin or equity of any such account.

      (d)  If an account in which security futures or related positions are held is the account of a joint venture in which the security futures intermediary participates, any interest of the security futures intermediary in the joint account in excess of the interest which the security futures intermediary would have on the basis of its right to share in the profits shall be margined in accordance with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).

      (e)  (1) No security futures intermediary may extend or maintain credit to or for any customer for the purpose of evading or circumventing any requirement under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).

      (2) A security futures intermediary may arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer by any person, provided that the security futures intermediary does not willfully arrange credit that would constitute a violation of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR parts 220, 221, and 224) by such person.

      (f)  Once a person ceases to qualify as an exempted person, it shall notify the security futures intermediary of this fact before entering into any new security futures transaction or related transaction that would require additional margin to be deposited under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49). Financial relations with respect to any such transactions shall be subject to the provisions of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).

      § 41.45   Required margin.

#### § § 41.45

      (a)  Each security futures intermediary shall determine the required margin for the security futures and related positions held on behalf of a customer in a securities account or futures account as set forth in this section.

      (b) —(1)  The required margin for each long or short position in a security future shall be fifteen (15) percent of the current market value of such security future.

      (2)  Notwithstanding the margin levels specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a self-regulatory authority may set the required initial or maintenance margin level for an offsetting position involving security futures and related positions at a level lower than the level that would be required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if such positions were margined separately, pursuant to rules that meet the criteria set forth in section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act.

      (c)  An exchange registered under section 6(g) of the Exchange Act, or a national securities association registered under section 15A(k) of the Exchange Act, may raise or lower the required margin level for a security future to a level not lower than that specified in this section, in accordance with section 19(b)(7) of the Exchange Act.

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a security futures intermediary need not value a margin equity security at its Regulation T collateral value when determining whether the required margin for the security futures and related positions in a futures account is satisfied,

      (i) The margin equity security is valued at an amount no greater than the current market value of the security reduced by the lowest percentage level of margin required for a long position in the security held in a margin account under the rules of a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Exchange Act;

      (ii) Additional margin is required to be deposited on any day when the day's security futures transactions and related transactions would create or increase a margin deficiency in the account if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value, and shall be for the amount of the margin deficiency so created or increased (a “special margin requirement”); and

      (iii) Cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for the positions in an account are not permitted to be withdrawn from the account at any time that:

      (A) Additional cash, securities, or other assets are required to be deposited as margin under this section for a transaction in the account on the same or a previous day; or

      (B) The withdrawal, together with other transactions, deposits, and withdrawals on the same day, would create or increase a margin deficiency if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value.

      (2) All security futures transactions and related transactions on any day shall be combined to determine the amount of a special margin requirement. Additional margin deposited to satisfy a special margin requirement shall be valued at an amount no greater than its Regulation T collateral value.

      (3) If the alternative collateral valuation method set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is used with respect to an account in which security futures or related positions are carried:

      (i) An account that is transferred from one security futures intermediary to another may be treated as if it had been maintained by the transferee from the date of its origin, if the transferee accepts, in good faith, a signed statement of the transferor (or, if that is not practicable, of the customer), that any margin call issued under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) has been satisfied; and

      (ii) An account that is transferred from one customer to another as part of a transaction, not undertaken to avoid the requirements of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), may be treated as if it had been maintained for the transferee from the date of its origin, if the security futures intermediary accepts in good faith and keeps with the transferee account a signed statement of the transferor describing the circumstances for the transfer.

      (f)  No guarantee of a customer's account shall be given any effect for purposes of determining whether the required margin in an account is satisfied, except as permitted under applicable margin rules.

      § 41.47   Withdrawal of margin.

#### § § 41.47

      (a)  Except as otherwise provided in § 41.46(e)(1)(ii) of this subpart, cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for positions in an account may be withdrawn, provided that the equity in the account after such withdrawal is sufficient to satisfy the required margin for the security futures and related positions in the account under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).

      (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the security futures intermediary, in its usual practice, may deduct the following items from an account in which security futures or related positions are held if they are considered in computing the balance of such account:

      (1) Variation settlement payable, directly or indirectly, to a clearing agency that is registered under section 17A of the Exchange Act or a derivatives clearing organization that is registered under section 5b of the Act;

      (2) Interest charged on credit maintained in the account;

      (3) Communication or shipping charges with respect to transactions in the account;

      (4) Payment of commissions, brokerage, taxes, storage and other charges lawfully accruing in connection with the positions and transactions in the account;

      (5) Any service charges that the security futures intermediary may impose; or

      (6) Any other withdrawals that are permitted from a securities margin account under Regulation T, to the extent permitted under applicable margin rules.

      § 41.48   Undermargined accounts.

#### § § 41.48

      (a)  If any margin call required by this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) is not met in full, the security futures intermediary shall take the deduction required with respect to an undermargined account in computing its net capital under SEC or Commission rules.

      (b)  If at any time there is a liquidating deficit in an account in which security futures are held, the security futures intermediary shall take steps to liquidate positions in the account promptly and in an orderly manner.

      (c)  Notwithstanding § 41.44(a)(1) of this subpart, § 220.4(d) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.4(d)) respecting liquidation of positions in lieu of deposit shall not apply with respect to security futures carried in a securities account.

      § 41.49   Filing proposed margin rule changes with the Commission.

#### § § 41.49

      (a)  Any self-regulatory authority that is registered with the Commission as a designated contract market under section 5f of the Act shall, when filing a proposed rule change regarding customer margin for security futures with the SEC for approval in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, concurrently provide to the Commission a copy of such proposed rule change and any accompanying documentation filed with the SEC.

      (b)  Any self-regulatory authority that is registered with the Commission as a designated contract market under section 5 of the Act shall, when filing a proposed rule change regarding customer margin for security futures with the SEC for approval in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, submit such proposed rule change to the Commission as follows:

      (1) If the self-regulatory authority elects to request the Commission's prior approval for the proposed rule change pursuant to section 5c(c)(2) of the Act, it shall concurrently file the proposed rule change with the Commission in accordance with § 40.5 of this chapter.

      (2) If the self-regulatory authority elects to implement a proposed rule change by written certification pursuant to section 5c(c)(1) of the Act, it shall concurrently provide to the Commission a copy of the proposed rule change and any accompanying documentation filed with the SEC. Promptly after obtaining SEC approval for the proposed rule change, such self-regulatory authority shall file its written certification with the Commission in accordance with § 40.6 of this chapter.

The asset classes include interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity, other commodity, and such other asset classes as may be determined by the Commission.

    means a publicly reportable swap transaction that:

    (1) Involves a swap that is listed on a swap execution facility or designated contract market;

    (2) Is executed on a swap execution facility's trading system or platform that is not an order book as defined in § 37.3(a)(3) of this chapter, or occurs away from the swap execution facility's or designated contract market's trading system or platform and is executed pursuant to the swap execution facility's or designated contract market's rules and procedures;

    (i) Under all such mirror swaps to which the prime broker that is a counterparty to the trigger swap is also a counterparty, the aggregate contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts shall be equal to the aggregate of the contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts under the corresponding trigger swap; and

    (ii) The market risk and contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts of all such mirror swaps to which a prime broker that is not a counterparty to the corresponding trigger swap is a party will offset each other, resulting in such prime broker having a flat market risk position at the execution of such mirror swaps.

    means all other currencies that are not super-major currencies or major currencies.

    means the process by which a party to a swap legally transfers all or part of its rights, liabilities, duties, and obligations under the swap to a new legal party other than the counterparty to the swap under applicable law.

    means:

    (1) Unless otherwise provided in this part—

    (i) Any executed swap that is an arm's-length transaction between two parties that results in a corresponding change in the market risk position between the two parties; or

    (ii) Any termination, assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, amendment, conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or obligations of a swap that changes the pricing of the swap.

    (ii) Portfolio compression exercises; and

    (iii) Swaps entered into by a derivatives clearing organization as part of managing the default of a clearing member.

    (3) These examples represent swaps that are not at arm's length and thus are not publicly reportable swap transactions, notwithstanding that they do result in a corresponding change in the market risk position between two parties.

    means a floating price series (including derivatives contract prices and cash market prices or price indices) used by the parties to a swap or swaption to determine payments made, exchanged, or accrued under the terms of a swap contract.

    means the party to a swap with the duty to report a publicly reportable swap transaction in accordance with this part and section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act.

    (2) To which one counterparty or both counterparties are prime brokers;

    (3) That serves as the contingency for, or triggers, the execution of one or more corresponding mirror swaps; and

    (4) That is a publicly reportable swap transaction that is required to be reported to a swap data repository pursuant to this part and part 45 of this chapter. A prime broker swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall be treated as the trigger swap for purposes of this part.

    means a data set that has had extraordinarily large notional transactions removed by transforming the data into a logarithm with a base of 10, computing the mean, and excluding transactions that are beyond two standard deviations above the mean for the other commodity asset class and three standard deviations above the mean for all other asset classes.

    § 43.3   Method and timing for real-time public reporting.

#### § § 43.3

    (a) —(1)  The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market responsible for reporting a swap as determined by this section shall report the publicly reportable swap transaction to a swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after execution, subject to paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section. Such reporting shall be done in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

    (2)  For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after execution.

    (3)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this section, a reporting counterparty shall report all publicly reportable swap transactions that are off-facility swaps to a swap data repository for the appropriate asset class in accordance with the rules set forth in this part as soon as technologically practicable after execution. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties prior to execution, the following shall be the reporting counterparty for a publicly reportable swap transaction that is an off-facility swap:

    (i) If only one party is a swap dealer or major swap participant, then the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty;

    (ii) If one party is a swap dealer and the other party is a major swap participant, then the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty;

    (iii) If both parties are swap dealers, then the swap dealers shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap;

    (iv) If both parties are major swap participants, then the major swap participants shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap; and

    (v) If neither party is a swap dealer or a major swap participant, then the parties shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap.

    (4) —(i)  The reporting counterparty may delay reporting a post-priced swap to a swap data repository until the earlier of the price being determined and 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date. If the price of a publicly reportable swap transaction that is a post-priced swap is not determined by 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository by 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date all swap transaction and pricing data for such post-priced swap other than the price and any other then-undetermined swap transaction and pricing data and shall report each such item of previously undetermined swap transaction and pricing data as soon as technologically practicable after such item is determined.

    (ii)  The post-priced swap reporting delay set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to publicly reportable swap transactions with respect to which the price is known at execution, but one or more other economic or other terms are not yet known at the time of execution.

    (5)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, if a clearing swap, as defined in § 45.1(a) of this chapter, is a publicly reportable swap transaction, the derivatives clearing organization that is a party to such swap shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all reporting counterparty obligations for such swap as soon as technologically practicable after execution.

    (6)  (i) A mirror swap is not a publicly reportable swap transaction. Execution of a trigger swap, for purposes of determining when execution occurs under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, shall be deemed to occur at the time of the pricing event for such trigger swap.

    (ii) With respect to a given set of swaps, if it is unclear which is, or are the mirror swap(s) and which is the related trigger swap (including, but not limited to, situations where there is more than one prime broker counterparty within such set of swaps and situations where the pricing event for each set of swaps occurs between prime brokerage agents of a common prime broker), or if under the prime brokerage agency arrangement, the trigger swap would occur between two prime brokers, the prime broker(s) shall determine which of the prime broker swaps shall be treated as the trigger swap and which are mirror swaps.

    (iii) Trigger swaps shall be reported in accordance with the following:

    (A) Trigger swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall be reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

    (B) Off-facility trigger swaps shall be reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except that if a counterparty to a trigger swap is a swap dealer that is not a prime broker with respect to that trigger swap, then that swap dealer counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty for the trigger swap.

    (7)  Any person required by this part to report swap transaction and pricing data, while remaining fully responsible for reporting as required by this part, may contract with a third-party service provider to facilitate reporting.

    (b) —(1)  A swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty, unless such swap transaction and pricing data is subject to a time delay described in § 43.5, in which case the swap transaction and pricing data shall be publicly disseminated in the manner described in § 43.5.

    (2)  Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall comply with part 49 of this chapter.

    (3)  (i) If there is a swap data repository for an asset class, a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a swap data repository unless:

    (A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a swap data repository for public dissemination;

    (B) Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such swap execution facility or designated contract market;

    (C) Market participants are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and

    (D) Any such disclosure by the swap execution facility or designated contract market is non-discriminatory.

    (ii) If there is a swap data repository for an asset class, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a swap data repository unless:

    (A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a swap data repository for public dissemination;

    (B) Such disclosure is only made to the customer base of such swap dealer or major swap participant, including parties who maintain accounts with or have been swap counterparties with such swap dealer or major swap participant;

    (C) Swap counterparties are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and

    (D) Any such disclosure by the swap dealer or major swap participant is non-discriminatory.

    (4)  Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for swaps in its selected asset class shall accept and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for all publicly reportable swap transactions within such asset class, unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission.

    (5)  Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall perform, on an annual basis, an independent review in accordance with established audit procedures and standards of the swap data repository's security and other system controls for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements in this part.

    (c)  (1) Swap data repositories shall make swap transaction and pricing data available on their websites for a period of time that is at least one year after the initial public dissemination of such data and shall make instructions freely available on their websites on how to download, save, and search such data.

    (2) Swap transaction and pricing data that is publicly disseminated pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available free of charge.

    (d)  (1) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market shall report the swap transaction and pricing data as described in the elements in appendix A of this part in the form and manner provided in the technical specification published by the Commission pursuant to § 43.7.

    (2) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market making such report shall satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository.

    (3) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market shall use the facilities, methods, or data standards provided or required by the swap data repository to which the entity or reporting counterparty reports the data.

    (e) —(1)  Any swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error relating to swap transaction and pricing data that it was required to report under this part shall correct the error. To correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall submit complete and accurate swap transaction and pricing data to the swap data repository that maintains the swap transaction and pricing data for the relevant swap, or completely and accurately report swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that was not previously reported to a swap data repository as required under this part, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirement to correct any error applies regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the swap transaction and pricing data, including a swap that has terminated, matured, or otherwise is no longer considered to be an open swap.

    (i)  The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall correct any error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of the error. In all cases, errors shall be corrected within seven business days after discovery. Any error that a reporting counterparty discovers or could have discovered during the verification process required under § 45.14(b) of this chapter is considered discovered for the purposes of this section as of the moment the reporting counterparty began the verification process during which the error was first discovered or discoverable.

    (ii)  If the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty will, for any reason, fail to timely correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall notify the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate. The notification shall be in the form and manner, and according to the instructions, specified by the Director of the Division of Data in concurrence with the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the respective Director may designate. Unless otherwise instructed by the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time, the notification shall include an initial assessment of the scope of the error or errors that were discovered, and shall include any initial remediation plan for correcting the error or errors, if an initial remediation plan exists. This notification shall be made within 12 hours of the swap execution facility's, designated contract market's, or reporting counterparty's determination that it will fail to timely correct the error.

    (iii)  In order to satisfy the requirements of this section, a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall conform to a swap data repository's policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.10 of this chapter for correction of errors.

    (2)  Any non-reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error in the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap to which it is the non-reporting counterparty, shall notify the reporting counterparty for the swap of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but not later than three business days following discovery of the error. If the non-reporting counterparty does not know the identity of the reporting counterparty, the non-reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market where the swap was executed of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but no later than three business days following the discovery. Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.

    (3)  The requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section only apply to errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention period under § 45.2 of this chapter has not expired as of the time the error is discovered. Errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention periods under § 45.2 of this chapter have expired at the time that the errors are discovered are not subject to the requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

    (4) —(i)  For the purposes of this part, there is an error when swap transaction and pricing data is not completely and accurately reported. This includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:

    (A) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap reported to a swap data repository is incorrect or any of the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained by a swap data repository differs from any of the relevant swap transaction and pricing data contained in the books and records of a party to the swap.

    (B) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is not reported to a swap data repository or is not maintained by the swap data repository as required by this part.

    (C) None of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is reported to a swap data repository or is maintained by a swap data repository.

    (D) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is no longer an open swap is maintained by the swap data repository as if the swap is still an open swap.

    (ii)  For the purposes of this section, there is a presumption that an error exists if the swap data or the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained and disseminated by an SDR for a swap is not complete and accurate. This includes, but is not limited to, the swap data that the SDR makes available to the reporting counterparty for verification under § 49.11 of this chapter.

    (f)  (1) A swap data repository shall validate each swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to the swap data repository and notify the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market submitting the report whether the report satisfied the data validation procedures of the swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after accepting the swap transaction and pricing data report. A swap data repository may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by making available data validation acceptance messages as required by § 49.10 of this chapter.

    (2) If a swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to a swap data repository does not satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository, the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market required to submit the report has not satisfied its obligation to report swap transaction and pricing data in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section. The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market has not satisfied its obligation until it submits the swap transaction and pricing data report in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section, which includes the requirement to satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository.

    (g)  Any fee or charge assessed on a reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market by a swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for the collection of such data shall be equitable and non-discriminatory. If such swap data repository allows a fee discount based on the volume of data reported to it for public dissemination, then such discount shall be made available to all reporting counterparties, swap execution facilities, and designated contract markets in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner.

    § 43.4   Swap transaction and pricing data to be publicly disseminated in real-time.

#### § § 43.4

    (a)  Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall publicly disseminate the information described in appendix A of this part for the swap transaction and pricing data, as applicable, in the form and manner provided in the technical specification published by the Commission pursuant to § 43.7.

    (b)  A swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time may require reporting counterparties, swap execution facilities, and designated contract markets to report to such swap data repository information that is necessary to compare the swap transaction and pricing data that was publicly disseminated in real-time to the data reported to a swap data repository pursuant to section 2(a)(13)(G) of the Act or to confirm that parties to a swap have reported in a timely manner pursuant to § 43.3. Such additional information shall not be publicly disseminated by the swap data repository.

    (c) —(1)  Swap transaction and pricing data that is publicly disseminated in real-time shall not disclose the identities of the parties to the swap or otherwise facilitate the identification of a party to a swap. A swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall not publicly disseminate such data in a manner that discloses or otherwise facilitates the identification of a party to a swap.

    (2)  Reporting counterparties, swap execution facilities, and designated contract markets shall provide a swap data repository with swap transaction and pricing data that includes an actual description of the underlying asset(s). This requirement is separate from the requirement that a reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market shall report swap data to a swap data repository pursuant to section 2(a)(13)(G) of the Act and 17 CFR chapter I.

    (3)  Notwithstanding the anonymity protection for certain swaps in the other commodity asset class in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a swap data repository shall publicly disseminate the actual underlying asset(s) of all publicly reportable swap transactions in the interest rate, credit, equity, and foreign exchange asset classes.

    (4)  A swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in the other commodity asset class as described in this paragraph.

    (i) A swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class in the manner described in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

    (ii) The actual underlying asset(s) shall be publicly disseminated for the following publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class:

    (A) Any publicly reportable swap transaction that references one of the contracts described in appendix B to this part;

    (B) Any publicly reportable swap transaction that is economically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B of this part; or

    (C) Any publicly reportable swap transaction executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.

    (iii) The underlying assets of swaps in the other commodity asset class that are not described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section shall be publicly disseminated by limiting the geographic detail of the underlying asset(s). The identification of any specific delivery point or pricing point associated with the underlying asset of such other commodity swap shall be publicly disseminated pursuant to appendix E of this part.

    (d) —(1)  The reporting counterparty shall report the actual notional or principal amount of any publicly reportable swap transaction that is an off-facility swap to a swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates such data pursuant to this part.

    (2)  (i) A swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report the actual notional or principal amount for all swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of such swap execution facility or designated contract market to a swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates such data pursuant to this part.

    (ii) The actual notional or principal amount for any block trade executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall be reported to the swap execution facility or designated contract market pursuant to the rules of the swap execution facility of designated contract market.

    (e)  The notional or principal amount of a publicly reportable swap transaction shall be publicly disseminated by a swap data repository subject to rounding as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, and the cap size as set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.

    (f)  (1) If the notional or principal amount is less than one thousand, round to nearest five, but in no case shall a publicly disseminated notional or principal amount be less than five;

    (2) If the notional or principal amount is less than 10 thousand but equal to or greater than one thousand, round to nearest one hundred;

    (3) If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 thousand but equal to or greater than 10 thousand, round to nearest one thousand;

    (4) If the notional or principal amount is less than one million but equal to or greater than 100 thousand, round to nearest 10 thousand;

    (5) If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 million but equal to or greater than one million, round to the nearest one million;

    (6) If the notional or principal amount is less than 500 million but equal to or greater than 100 million, round to the nearest 10 million;

    (7) If the notional or principal amount is less than one billion but equal to or greater than 500 million, round to the nearest 50 million;

    (8) If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 billion but equal to or greater than one billion, round to the nearest 100 million;

    (9) If the notional or principal amount is equal to or greater than 100 billion, round to the nearest 10 billion.

    (g)  Prior to the effective date of a Commission determination to establish an applicable post-initial cap size for a swap category as determined pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the initial cap sizes for each swap category shall be equal to the greater of the initial appropriate minimum block size for the respective swap category in appendix F of this part or the respective cap sizes in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section. If appendix F of this part does not provide an initial appropriate minimum block size for a particular swap category, the initial cap size for such swap category shall be equal to the appropriate cap size as set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.—

    (1) For swaps in the interest rate asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be:

    (i) USD 250 million for swaps with a tenor greater than zero up to and including two years;

    (ii) USD 100 million for swaps with a tenor greater than two years up to and including ten years; and

    (h)  (1) The Commission shall establish, by swap categories, post-initial cap sizes as described in paragraphs (h)(2) through (8) of this section.

    (2) The Commission shall determine post-initial cap sizes for the swap categories described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i) through (xii), (c)(4)(i), and (c)(5)(i) of § 43.6 by utilizing reliable data collected by swap data repositories, as determined by the Commission, based on paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the Commission is unable to determine a cap size for any swap category described in § 43.6(c)(1)(i), the Commission shall assign a cap size of USD 100 million to such category.

    (i) A one-year window of swap transaction and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap category recalculated no less than once each calendar year; and

    (ii) The 75-percent notional amount calculation described in § 43.6(d)(2).

    (3) The Commission shall determine the post-initial cap size for a swap category in the foreign exchange asset class described in § 43.6(c)(4)(ii) as the lower of the notional amount of either currency's cap size for the swap category described in § 43.6(c)(4)(i).

    (4) All swaps or instruments in the swap category described in § 43.6(c)(1)(ii) shall have a cap size of USD 100 million.

    (1)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for any publicly reportable swap transaction that falls within the swap categories described in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(i), (b)(5)(i), or (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the initial appropriate minimum block size for such publicly reportable swap transaction shall be the appropriate minimum block size that is in appendix F of this part.

    (2)  All swaps or instruments in the swap categories described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii) of this section shall be eligible to be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable.

    (3)  Publicly reportable swap transactions described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section that are economically related to a futures contract in appendix B of this part shall not qualify to be treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps (as applicable), if such futures contract is not subject to a designated contract market's block trading rules.

    (g) —(1)  The Commission shall establish, by swap categories, the appropriate minimum block sizes as described in paragraphs (g)(2) through (6) of this section. No less than once each calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall update the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes.

    (2)  The Commission shall determine post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes for the swap categories described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i) through (xii), (c)(4)(i), and (c)(5)(i) of this section by utilizing a one-year window of swap transaction and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap category reviewed no less than once each calendar year, and by applying the 67-percent notional amount calculation to such data. If the Commission is unable to determine an appropriate minimum block size for any swap category described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Commission shall assign a block size of zero to such swap category.

    (3)  The parties to a swap in the foreign exchange asset class described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section may elect to receive block treatment if the notional amount of either currency in the exchange is greater than the minimum block size for a swap in the foreign exchange asset class between the respective currency, in the same amount, and U.S. dollars described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

    (4) All swaps or instruments in the swap category described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (c)(2)(xiii), (c)(4)(iii), and (c)(5)(ii) of this section shall have a block size of zero and be eligible to be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable.

    (5)  The Commission shall publish the appropriate minimum block sizes determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section on its website at

    (6)  Unless otherwise indicated on the Commission's website, the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be effective on the first day of the second month following the date of publication.

    (h) —(1)  (i) If the parties make such an election, the reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market, as applicable, of the parties' election. The parties to a publicly reportable swap transaction may elect to have a publicly reportable swap transaction treated as a block trade if such swap:

    (A) Is executed on the trading system or platform, that is not an order book as defined in § 37.3(a)(3) of this chapter of a swap execution facility, or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market; and

    (B) That has a notional amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size.

If the parties make such an election, the reporting counterparty for such publicly reportable swap transaction shall notify the applicable swap data repository of the reporting counterparty's election when reporting the swap transaction and pricing data in accordance with this part.

    (i)  The following special rules shall apply to the determination of appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes—

    (1)  The notional amount of a swap with optionality shall equal the notional amount of the component of the swap that does not include the option component.

    (2)  The parties to a swap transaction with composite reference prices may elect to apply the lowest appropriate minimum block size or cap size applicable to one component reference price's swap category of such publicly reportable swap transaction.

    (3)  Unless otherwise specified in this part, the notional amount for a physical commodity swap shall be based on the notional unit measure utilized in the related futures contract or the predominant notional unit measure used to determine notional quantities in the cash market for the relevant, underlying physical commodity.

    (4)  Unless otherwise specified in this part, when the appropriate minimum block size or cap size for a publicly reportable swap transaction is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, parties to a swap and registered entities may use a currency exchange rate that is widely published within the preceding two business days from the date of execution of the swap transaction in order to determine such qualification.

    (5)  For currencies that succeed a super-major currency, the appropriate currency classification for such currency shall be based on the corresponding nominal gross domestic product classification (in U.S. dollars) as determined in the most recent World Bank, World Development Indicator at the time of succession. If the gross domestic product of the country or nation utilizing the successor currency is:

    (i) Greater than $2 trillion, then the successor currency shall be included among the super-major currencies;

    (ii) Greater than $500 billion but less than $2 trillion, then the successor currency shall be included among the major currencies; or

    (iii) Less than $500 billion, then the successor currency shall be included among the non-major currencies.

    (6)  The aggregation of orders for different accounts in order to satisfy the minimum block trade size or the cap size requirement is permitted for publicly reportable swap transactions only if each of the following conditions is satisfied:

    (i) The aggregation of orders is done by a person who:

    (A) Is a commodity trading advisor registered pursuant to section 4n of the Act, or exempt from such registration under the Act, or a principal thereof, and who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts;

    (B) Is an investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of § 4.7(a)(6)(i)(G) of this chapter; or

    (C) Is a foreign person who performs a similar role or function as the persons described in paragraph (i)(6)(i)(A) or (B) of this section and is subject as such to foreign regulation;

    (ii) The aggregated transaction is reported pursuant to this part and part 45 of this chapter as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable, subject to the cap size thresholds;

    (iii) The aggregated orders are executed as one swap transaction; and

    (iv) Aggregation occurs on a designated contract market or swap execution facility if the swap is listed for trading by a designated contract market or swap execution facility.

    (j)  (1) Parties to a block trade shall be “eligible contract participants,” as defined in section 1a(18) of the Act and 17 CFR chapter I. However, a designated contract market may allow:

    (i) A commodity trading advisor registered pursuant to section 4n of the Act, or exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal thereof, and who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts,

    (ii) An investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of § 4.7(a)(6)(i)(G) of this chapter, or

    (iii) A foreign person who performs a similar role or function as the persons described in paragraph (j)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and is subject as such to foreign regulation, to transact block trades for customers who are not eligible contract participants.

    (2) A person transacting a block trade on behalf of a customer shall receive prior written instruction or consent from the customer to do so. Such instruction or consent may be provided in the power of attorney or similar document by which the customer provides the person with discretionary trading authority or the authority to direct the trading in its account.

    (a)  For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (1)  The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier at, or as soon as technologically practicable following, the time of execution of the swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:

    (i) The legal entity identifier of the swap execution facility or designated contract market; and

    (ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap execution facility or designated contract market, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap execution facility or designated contract market.

    (2)  The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:

    (i) To the swap data repository to which the swap execution facility or designated contract market reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;

    (ii) To each counterparty to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap;

    (iii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.

    (b)  For each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a financial entity, the reporting counterparty shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (1)  The reporting counterparty shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap and prior to both the reporting of required swap creation data and the transmission of swap data to a derivatives clearing organization if the swap is to be cleared. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:

    (i) The legal entity identifier of the reporting counterparty; and

    (ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the reporting counterparty, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that reporting counterparty.

    (2)  The reporting counterparty shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:

    (i) To the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;

    (ii) To the non-reporting counterparty to the swap, no later than the applicable deadline in § 45.3(b) for reporting required swap creation data; and

    (iii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.

    (c)  For each off-facility swap for which the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparty that is not a financial entity, the reporting counterparty shall either: Create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; or request that the swap data repository to which required swap creation data will be reported create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (1)  The swap data repository shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier as soon as technologically practicable following receipt of the request from the reporting counterparty. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:

    (i) The legal entity identifier of the swap data repository; and

    (ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap data repository, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap data repository.

    (2)  The swap data repository shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:

    (i) To the counterparties to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique transaction identifier; and

    (ii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique transaction identifier.

    (d)  For each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a derivatives clearing organization, the reporting counterparty shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

    (1)  The derivatives clearing organization shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier upon, or as soon as technologically practicable after, acceptance of an original swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data for the clearing swap. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:

    (i) The legal entity identifier of the derivatives clearing organization; and

    (ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that clearing swap by the automated systems of the derivatives clearing organization, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that derivatives clearing organization.

    (2)  The derivatives clearing organization shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:

    (i) To the swap data repository to which the derivatives clearing organization reports required swap creation data for the clearing swap, as part of that report; and

    (ii) To its counterparty to the clearing swap, as soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of a swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap.

    (e)  For swaps involving allocation, unique transaction identifiers shall be created and transmitted as follows.

    (1)  The unique transaction identifier for the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent shall be created as required by paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, as applicable, and shall be transmitted as follows:

    (i) If the unique transaction identifier is created by a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must include the unique transaction identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the reporting counterparty and to the agent.

    (ii) If the unique transaction identifier is created by the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty must include the unique transaction identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the agent.

    (2)  The reporting counterparty must create a unique transaction identifier for each of the individual swaps resulting from allocation, as soon as technologically practicable after it is informed by the agent of the identities of its actual counterparties, and must transmit each such unique transaction identifier to:

    (i) The non-reporting counterparty for the swap in question.

    (ii) The agent; and

    (iii) The derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.

    (f)  Each registered entity and swap counterparty shall include the unique transaction identifier for a swap in all of its records and all of its swap data reporting concerning that swap, from the time it creates or receives the unique transaction identifier as provided in this section, throughout the existence of the swap and for as long as any records are required by the Act or Commission regulations to be kept concerning the swap, regardless of any life cycle events concerning the swap, including, without limitation, any changes with respect to the counterparties to the swap.

    (g)  If a registered entity or reporting counterparty required by this part to report required swap creation data or required swap continuation data contracts with a third-party service provider to facilitate reporting pursuant to § 45.9, the registered entity or reporting counterparty shall ensure that such third-party service provider creates and transmits the unique transaction identifier as otherwise required for such category of swap by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:

    (1) The legal entity identifier of the third-party service provider; and

    (2) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the third-party service provider, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that third-party service provider.

    (h)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, if a swap is also reportable to one or more other jurisdictions with a regulatory reporting deadline earlier than the deadline set forth in § 45.3 or in part 43 of this chapter, the same unique transaction identifier generated according to the rules of the jurisdiction with the earliest regulatory reporting deadline shall be transmitted pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section and used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part.

    § 45.6   Legal entity identifiers.

#### § § 45.6

    Each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and counterparty to any swap that is eligible to receive a legal entity identifier shall obtain, maintain, and be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by a single legal entity identifier as specified in this section.

    (a)  As used in this section:

    means an entity authorized under the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System to issue legal entity identifiers.

    means all identification and relationship information, as set forth in the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, of the legal entity or individual to which a legal entity identifier is assigned.

    means submission by a legal entity or individual of its own reference data.

    means submission of reference data for a legal entity or individual that is or may become a swap counterparty, made by an entity or organization other than the legal entity or individual identified by the submitted reference data. Examples of third-party registration include, without limitation, submission by a swap dealer or major swap participant of reference data for its swap counterparties, and submission by a national numbering agency, national registration agency, or data service provider of reference data concerning legal entities or individuals with respect to which the agency or service provider maintains information.

    (b)  The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall be issued under, and shall conform to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), issued by the International Organization for Standardization.

    (c)  Reference data for each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and counterparty to any swap shall be reported, by self-registration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System. All subsequent changes and corrections to reference data previously reported shall be reported, by self-registration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.

    (d)  (1) Each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and swap counterparty shall use legal entity identifiers to identify itself and swap counterparties in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part. If a swap counterparty is not eligible to receive a legal entity identifier as determined by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, such counterparty shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part with an alternate identifier as prescribed by the Commission pursuant to § 45.13(a) of this chapter.

    (2) Each swap dealer, major swap participant, swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, and swap data repository shall maintain and renew its legal identity identifier in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System.

    (3) Each financial entity reporting counterparty executing a swap with a counterparty that is eligible to receive a legal entity identifier, but has not been assigned a legal entity identifier, shall, prior to reporting any required swap creation data for such swap, use best efforts to cause a legal entity identifier to be assigned to the counterparty. If these efforts do not result in a legal entity identifier being assigned to the counterparty prior to the reporting of required swap creation data, the financial entity reporting counterparty shall promptly provide the identity and contact information of the counterparty to the Commission.

    (4) For swaps previously reported pursuant to this part using substitute counterparty identifiers assigned by a swap data repository prior to Commission designation of a legal entity identifier system, each swap data repository shall map the legal entity identifiers for the counterparties to the substitute counterparty identifiers in the record for each such swap.

    § 45.7   Unique product identifiers.

#### § § 45.7

    Each swap shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a unique product identifier and product classification system as specified in this section. Each swap sufficiently standardized to receive a unique product identifier shall be identified by a unique product identifier. Each swap not sufficiently standardized for this purpose shall be identified by its description using the product classification system.

    (a)  The unique product identifier and product classification system shall identify and describe the swap asset class and the sub-type within that asset class to which the swap belongs, and the underlying product for the swap, with sufficient distinctiveness and specificity to enable the Commission and other financial regulators to fulfill their regulatory responsibilities and to assist in real time reporting of swaps as provided in the Act and part 43 of this chapter. The level of distinctiveness and specificity which the unique product identifier will provide shall be determined separately for each swap asset class.

    (b)  (1) The Commission shall determine when a unique product identifier and product classification system that is acceptable to the Commission and satisfies the requirements set forth in this section is available for use in compliance with this section.

    (2) When the Commission determines that such a unique product identifier and product classification system is available, the Commission shall designate the unique product identifier and product classification system to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the  and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the issuer of such unique product identifiers, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining unique product identifiers and using the product classification system.

    (c)  (1) When a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the unique product identifier and product classification system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.

    (2) Before a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the internal product identifier or product description used by the swap data repository to which a swap is reported in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.

    § 45.10   Reporting to a single swap data repository.

#### § § 45.10

    All swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a given swap shall be reported to a single swap data repository, which shall be the swap data repository to which the first report of such data is made, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (a)  To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market is reported to a single swap data repository:

    (1) The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for a swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit to both counterparties to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

    (2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to that same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (b)  To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for an off-facility swap that is not a clearing swap is reported to a single swap data repository:

    (1) The reporting counterparty shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

    (2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (c)  To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a given clearing swap, including clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap or that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, is reported to a single swap data repository:

    (1) The derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such clearing swap shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for that clearing swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of an original swap for clearing, or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall transmit to the counterparty to each clearing swap the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

    (2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data and required swap continuation data for that clearing swap shall be reported by the derivatives clearing organization to the same swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (3) For clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap, and for equal and opposite clearing swaps that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall report all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for such clearing swaps to a single swap data repository.

    (d)  A reporting counterparty may change the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data is reported as set forth in this paragraph.

    (1)  At least five business days prior to changing the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a swap, the reporting counterparty shall provide notice of such change to the other counterparty to the swap, the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data is currently reported, and the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data will be reported going forward. Such notification shall include the unique transaction identifier of the swap and the date on which the reporting counterparty will begin reporting such swap transaction and pricing data and swap data to a different swap data repository.

    (2)  After providing the notifications required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall follow paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to complete the change of swap data repository.

    (i) The reporting counterparty shall report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty is currently reporting swap transaction and pricing data and swap data as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to § 45.4.

    (ii) On the same day that the reporting counterparty reports required swap continuation data as required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall also report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data will be reported going forward as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to § 45.4. The required swap continuation data report shall identify the swap using the same unique transaction identifier used to identify the swap at the previous swap data repository.

    (iii) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty for the swap makes another change to the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

#### § § 45.14

    (a) —(1)  Any swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error relating to swap data that it was required to report under this part shall correct the error. To correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall submit complete and accurate swap data to the swap data repository that maintains the swap data for the relevant swap, or completely and accurately report swap data for a swap that was not previously reported to a swap data repository as required under this part, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirement to correct any error applies regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the swap data, including a swap that has terminated, matured, or otherwise is no longer considered to be an open swap.

    (i)  The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall correct any error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of the error. In all cases, errors shall be corrected within seven business days after discovery. Any error that a reporting counterparty discovers or could have discovered during the verification process required under paragraph (b) of this section is considered discovered for the purposes of this section as of the moment the reporting counterparty began the verification process during which the error was first discovered or discoverable.

    (ii)  If the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty will, for any reason, fail to timely correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall notify the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time. The notification shall be in the form and manner, and according to the instructions, specified by the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time. Unless otherwise instructed by the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time, the notification shall include an initial assessment of the scope of the error or errors that were discovered, and shall include any initial remediation plan for correcting the error or errors, if an initial remediation plan exists. This notification shall be made within 12 hours of the swap execution facility's, designated contract market's, or reporting counterparty's determination that it will fail to timely correct the error.

    (iii)  In order to satisfy the requirements of this section, a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall conform to a swap data repository's policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.10 of this chapter for correction of errors.

    (2)  Any non-reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error in the swap data for a swap to which it is the non-reporting counterparty, shall notify the reporting counterparty for the swap of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but not later than three business days following discovery of the error. If the non-reporting counterparty does not know the identity of the reporting counterparty, the non-reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market where the swap was executed of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but no later than three business days following the discovery. Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.

    (3)  The requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section only apply to errors in swap data relating to swaps for which the record retention period under § 45.2 has not expired as of the time the error is discovered. Errors in swap data relating to swaps for which the record retention periods under § 45.2 have expired at the time that the errors are discovered are not subject to the requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b)  Each reporting counterparty shall verify that there are no errors in the swap data for all open swaps that the reporting counterparty reported, or was required to report, to a swap data repository under the requirements of this part, in accordance with this paragraph (b).

    (1)  Each reporting counterparty shall utilize the mechanism for verification that each swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports swap data adopts under § 49.11 of this chapter. Each reporting counterparty shall utilize the relevant mechanism(s) to compare all swap data for each open swap for which it serves as the reporting counterparty maintained by the relevant swap data repository or repositories with all swap data contained in the reporting counterparty's internal books and records for each swap, to verify that there are no errors in the relevant swap data maintained by the swap data repository. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a reporting counterparty is not required to verify the accuracy and completeness of any swap data to which the reporting counterparty is not permitted access under the Act or Commission regulations, including, but not limited to, § 49.17 of this chapter.

    (2)  In performing verification as required by this paragraph, each reporting counterparty shall conform to each relevant swap data repository's verification policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.11 of this chapter. If a reporting counterparty utilizes a third-party service provider to perform verification, the reporting counterparty shall conform to each relevant swap data repository's third-party service provider verification policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.11 of this chapter and shall require the third-party service provider to conform to the same policies and procedures while performing verification on behalf of the reporting counterparty.

    (3)  Any and all errors discovered during the verification process shall be corrected in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (4)  Each reporting counterparty shall perform verification at a minimum:

    (i) If the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer, major swap participant, or derivatives clearing organization, once every thirty calendar days; or

    (ii) If the reporting counterparty is not a swap dealer, major swap participant, or a derivatives clearing organization, once every calendar quarter, provided that there are at least two calendar months between verifications.

    (5)  Each reporting counterparty shall keep a log of each verification that it performs. For each verification, the log shall include all errors discovered during the verification, and the corrections performed under paragraph (a) of this section. This requirement is in addition to any other applicable reporting counterparty recordkeeping requirement.

    (c) —(1)  For the purposes of this part, there is an error when swap data is not completely and accurately reported. This includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:

    (i) Any of the swap data for a swap reported to a swap data repository is incorrect or any of the swap data that is maintained by a swap data repository differs from any of the relevant swap data contained in the books and records of a party to the swap.

    (ii) Any of the swap data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is not reported to a swap data repository or is not maintained by the swap data repository as required by this part.

    (iii) None of the swap data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is reported to a swap data repository or is maintained by a swap data repository.

    (iv) Any of the swap data for a swap that is no longer an open swap is maintained by the swap data repository as if the swap is still an open swap.

    (2)  For the purposes of this section, there is a presumption that an error exists if the swap data that is maintained and disseminated by an SDR for a swap is not complete and accurate. This includes, but is not limited to, the swap data that the SDR makes available to the reporting counterparty for verification under § 49.11 of this chapter.

    § 46.3   Data reporting for pre-enactment swaps and transition swaps.

#### § § 46.3

    (a) —(1)  For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report electronically to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, the following:

    (i) All of the minimum primary economic terms data specified in appendix 1 to this part that were in the possession of the reporting counterparty on or after April 25, 2011;

    (ii) The legal entity identifier of the reporting counterparty required pursuant to § 46.4; and

    (iii) The following additional identifiers:

    (A) The internal counterparty identifier or legal entity identifier used by the reporting counterparty to identify the non-reporting counterparty.

    (B) The internal transaction identifier used by the reporting counterparty to identify the swap.

    (2)  (i) For each uncleared pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, throughout the existence of the swap following the compliance date, the reporting counterparty must report all required swap continuation data as required by part 45 of this chapter.

    (ii) Swap continuation data reporting is not required for a pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that has been cleared by a designated clearing organization.

    (3)  (i) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a multi-asset swap, all data required to be reported by this part shall be reported to a single swap data repository that accepts swaps in the asset class treated as the primary asset class involved in the swap by the reporting counterparty making the first report of such data pursuant to this section.

    (ii) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a mixed swap, all data required to be reported pursuant to this part shall be reported to a swap data repository registered with the Commission and to a security-based swap data repository registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This requirement may be satisfied by reporting the mixed swap to a swap data repository or security-based swap data repository registered with both Commissions.

    (b) —(1)  For each pre-enactment swap which expired or was terminated prior to April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, such information relating to the terms of the transaction as was in the reporting counterparty's possession on or after October 14, 2010 (17 CFR 44.00 through 44.02). This information may be reported via any method selected by the reporting counterparty.

    (2)  For each transition swap which expired or was terminated prior to April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, such information relating to the terms of the transaction as was in the reporting counterparty's possession on or after December 17, 2010 (17 CFR 44.03). This information may be reported via any method selected by the reporting counterparty.

    (c)  For all pre-enactment and transition swaps required to be reported pursuant to this part, the reporting counterparty may make the initial data report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the data report required by paragraph (b) of this section, prior to the applicable compliance date, if a swap data repository accepting swaps in the asset class in question is prepared to accept the report. The obligation to report continuation data as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a swap for which a voluntary early submission is made commences on the applicable compliance date. However, the reporting counterparty may submit continuation data at any time after a voluntary early submission made pursuant to this paragraph, if the swap data repository is prepared to accept such continuation data, and if that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository as of the applicable compliance date.

    (d)  If the reporting counterparty for a pre-enactment or transition swap has reported any of the information required as paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section to a trade repository prior to the compliance date, and if as of the compliance date that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository, then:

    (1) The counterparty shall not be required to report such previously reported information to the swap data repository again;

    (2) The counterparty shall be required to report to the swap data repository on the compliance date any information required as part of the initial data report by paragraph (a) of this section that has not been reported prior to the compliance date: and

    (3) In the case of pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the initial data report required by paragraph (a) of this section and all subsequent data reporting concerning the swap shall be made to the same swap data repository to which data concerning the swap was first reported prior to the compliance date (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).

    § 46.4   Unique identifiers.

#### § § 46.4

    The unique identifier requirements for data reporting with respect to pre-enactment or transition swaps shall be as follows:

    (a) By the compliance date, the reporting counterparty (as defined by part 45 of this chapter) for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain for itself a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier), and shall include its own legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) in the initial data report concerning the swap. With respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty and the swap data repository to which the swap is reported shall comply thereafter with all unique identifier requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.

    (b) Within 180 days after the compliance date, the non-reporting counterparty for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier as provided in § 45.6(f) of this chapter), and shall provide its legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) to the reporting counterparty. Upon receipt of the non-reporting counterparty's legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier), the reporting counterparty shall provide it to the swap data repository to which swap data for the swap was reported. Thereafter, with respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the non-reporting counterparty, the counterparties to the swap and the swap data repository to which it is reported shall comply with all requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.

    (c) The legal entity identifier requirements of parts 46 and 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011.

    (d) The unique swap identifier, unique transaction identifier, and unique product identifier requirements of part 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps.

    § 46.5   Determination of which counterparty must report.

#### § § 46.5

    (a) Determination of which counterparty must report data concerning each pre-enactment or transition swap shall be made as follows:

    (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (2) If neither party is an swap dealer, and only one counterparty is an major swap participant, the major swap participant shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty.

    (4) For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap for which both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall fulfill reporting obligations with respect to that swap; and the counterparty so selected shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, for pre-enactment or transition swaps for which both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, if only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (b) For pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence as of the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the current counterparties to the swap as of the compliance date, regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.

    (c) For pre-enactment and transition swaps for which reporting is required, but which have expired or been terminated prior to the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to the counterparties to the swap as of the date of its expiration or termination (except for determination of a counterparty's status as an SD or MSP, which shall be made as of the compliance date), regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.

    (d) After the initial report required by § 46.3 is made, if a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.

    (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

    (4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties.

    § 49.3   Procedures for registration.

#### § § 49.3

    (a)  (1) An applicant, person or entity desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions contained therein.

    (2) The application shall include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review procedures.

    (3)  The Commission will review the application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed submission on Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.

    (4)  The Commission shall grant the registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with this § 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is denying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.

    (5)  If any information reported on Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the application for registration has been granted under this paragraph (a), the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information.

    (6)  Each swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations thereunder.

    (b)  The Commission, upon the request of an applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data repository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to demonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple redundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration of a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that the Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data repository; or the date that the Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall terminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

    (c)  An applicant for registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.

    (d)  Before accepting or re-accepting SDR data, a dormant swap data repository as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter shall reinstate its registration under the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and accurately describe, current conditions.

    (e)  (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or the Director's delegates, with the consultation of the General Counsel or the General Counsel's delegates, the authority to notify an applicant seeking registration as a swap data repository pursuant to Section 21 of the Act that the application is materially incomplete and the 180-day period review period is extended.

    (2) The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph.

    (3) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

    (f)  An applicant for registration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted in its application as set forth in §§ 40.8 and 145.9 of this chapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment.

    (2) Prior to filing a request to withdraw, a swap data repository shall execute an agreement with the custodial swap data repository governing the custody of the withdrawing swap data repository's data and records. The custodial swap data repository shall retain such records for at least as long as the remaining period of time the swap data repository withdrawing from registration would have been required to retain such records pursuant to this part.

    (b) A notice of withdrawal from registration filed by a swap data repository shall become effective for all matters (except as provided in this paragraph (b)) on the 60th day after the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such swap data repository consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest.

    (c)  If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that any swap data repository has obtained its registration by making any false or misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to comply with any provision of the Act and regulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. Pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and in the public interest.

    § 49.10   Acceptance and validation of data.

#### § § 49.10

    (a) —(1)  A swap data repository shall establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to facilitate the complete and accurate reporting of SDR data. A swap data repository shall promptly accept, validate, and record SDR data.

    (2)  For the purpose of accepting SDR data, the swap data repository shall adopt policies and procedures, including technological protocols, which provide for electronic connectivity between the swap data repository and designated contract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, swap execution facilities, swap dealers, major swap participants and non-SD/MSP/DCO reporting counterparties who report such data. The technological protocols established by a swap data repository shall provide for the receipt of SDR data. The swap data repository shall ensure that its mechanisms for SDR data acceptance are reliable and secure.

    (b)  A swap data repository shall set forth in its application for registration as described in § 49.3 the specific asset class or classes for which it will accept SDR data. If a swap data repository accepts SDR data of a particular asset class, then it shall accept SDR data from all swaps of that asset class, unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission.

    (c)  A swap data repository shall validate SDR data as soon as technologically practicable after such data is accepted according to the validation conditions approved in writing by the Commission. A swap data repository shall validate SDR data by providing data validation acceptance messages and data validation error messages, as provided in this paragraph (c).

    (1)  A swap data repository shall validate each SDR data report submitted to the swap data repository and notify the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, designated contract market, or third-party service provider submitting the report whether the report satisfied the data validation procedures of the swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after accepting the SDR data report.

    (2)  If SDR data contains one or more data validation errors, the swap data repository shall distribute a data validation error message to the designated contract market, swap execution facility, reporting counterparty, or third-party service provider that submitted such SDR data as soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of such data. Each data validation error message shall indicate which specific data validation error(s) was identified in the SDR data.

    (3)  If a swap data repository allows for the joint submission of swap transaction and pricing data and swap data, the swap data repository shall validate the swap transaction and pricing data and swap data separately. Swap transaction and pricing data that satisfies the data validation procedures applied by a swap data repository shall not be deemed to contain a data validation error because it was submitted to the swap data repository jointly with swap data that contained a data validation error.

    (d)  A swap data repository shall establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent any provision in a valid swap from being invalidated or modified through the verification or recording process of the swap data repository. The policies and procedures shall ensure that the swap data repository's user agreements are designed to prevent any such invalidation or modification.

    (e) —(1)  A swap data repository shall accept error corrections for SDR data. _Error corrections_ include corrections to errors and omissions in SDR data previously reported to the swap data repository pursuant to part 43, 45, or 46 of this chapter, as well as omissions in reporting SDR data for swaps that were not previously reported to a swap data repository as required under part 43, 45, or 46 of this chapter. The requirement to accept error corrections applies for all swaps, regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the SDR data. This includes swaps that have terminated, matured, or are otherwise no longer considered to be open swaps, provided that the record retention period under § 49.12(b)(2) has not expired as of the time the error correction is reported.

    (2)  A swap data repository shall record the corrections, as soon as technologically practicable after the swap data repository accepts the error correction.

    (3)  A swap data repository shall disseminate corrected SDR data to the public and the Commission, as applicable, in accordance with this chapter, as soon as technologically practicable after the swap data repository records the corrected SDR data.

    (4)  A swap data repository shall establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures designed for the swap data repository to accept error corrections, to record the error corrections as soon as technologically practicable after the swap data repository accepts the error correction, and to disseminate corrected SDR data to the public and to the Commission, as applicable, in accordance with this chapter.

    (f)  A swap data repository shall establish procedures and provide facilities for effectively resolving disputes over the accuracy of the SDR data and positions that are recorded in the swap data repository.

#### § § 49.11

    (a)  Each swap data repository shall verify the accuracy and completeness of swap data that it receives from swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, reporting counterparties, or third-party service providers acting on their behalf, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b) —(1)  Each swap data repository shall provide a mechanism that allows each reporting counterparty that is a user of the swap data repository to access all swap data maintained by the swap data repository for each open swap for which the reporting counterparty is serving as the reporting counterparty, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This mechanism shall allow sufficient access, provide sufficient information, and be in a form and manner to enable each reporting counterparty to perform swap data verification as required under § 45.14 of this chapter.

    (2)  The swap data accessible through the mechanism provided by each swap data repository shall accurately reflect the most current swap data maintained by the swap data repository, as of the time the reporting counterparty accesses the swap data using the provided mechanism, for each data field that the reporting counterparty was required to report for each relevant open swap pursuant to part 45 of this chapter, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The swap data accessible through the mechanism provided by each swap data repository shall include sufficient information to allow reporting counterparties to successfully perform the swap data verification required under § 45.14 of this chapter.

    (3)  The swap data access each swap data repository shall provide pursuant to this section is subject to all applicable confidentiality requirements of the Act and this chapter, including, but not limited to, § 49.17. The swap data accessible to any reporting counterparty shall not include any swap data that the relevant reporting counterparty is prohibited to access under any Commission regulation.

    (4)  Each swap data repository shall allow each reporting counterparty that is a user of the relevant swap data repository to utilize the mechanism as required under this section with at least sufficient frequency to allow each relevant reporting counterparty to perform the swap data verification required under § 45.14 of this chapter.

    (5)  If a reporting counterparty informs a swap data repository that the reporting counterparty will utilize a third-party service provider to perform verification as required pursuant to § 45.14 of this chapter, the swap data repository will satisfy its requirements under this section by providing the third-party service provider with the same access to the mechanism and the relevant swap data for the reporting counterparty under this section, as if the third-party service provider was the reporting counterparty. The access for the third-party service provider shall be in addition to the access for the reporting counterparty required under this section. The access for the third-party service provider under this paragraph shall continue until the reporting counterparty informs the swap data repository that the third-party service provider should no longer have access on behalf of the reporting counterparty. The policies and procedures each swap data repository adopts under paragraph (c) of this section shall include instructions detailing how each reporting counterparty can successfully inform the swap data repository regarding a third-party service provider.

    (c) —(1)  Each swap data repository shall establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section. Such policies and procedures shall include, but are not limited to, instructions detailing how each reporting counterparty, or third-party service provider acting on behalf of a reporting counterparty, can successfully utilize the mechanism provided pursuant to this section to perform each reporting counterparty's verification responsibilities under § 45.14 of this chapter.

    (2)  Each swap data repository shall comply with the requirements under part 40 of this chapter in adopting or amending the policies and procedures required by this section.

    (2) Establish and maintain emergency procedures, backup facilities, and a business continuity-disaster recovery plan that allow for the timely recovery and resumption of operations and the fulfillment of the duties and obligations of the swap data repository; and

    (3) Periodically conduct tests to verify that backup resources are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of all duties of the swap data repository established by the Act or the Commission's regulations.

    (b) A swap data repository's program of risk analysis and oversight with respect to its operations and automated systems shall address each of the following categories of risk analysis and oversight:

    (1)  This category includes, but is not limited to: Assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of security and technology risk; security and technology capital planning and investment; board of directors and management oversight of technology and security; information technology audit and controls assessments; remediation of deficiencies; and any other elements of enterprise risk management and governance included in generally accepted best practices.

    (2)  This category includes, but is not limited to, controls relating to: Access to systems and data (including least privilege, separation of duties, account monitoring and control); user and device identification and authentication; security awareness training; audit log maintenance, monitoring, and analysis; media protection; personnel security and screening; automated system and communications protection (including network port control, boundary defenses, encryption); system and information integrity (including malware defenses, software integrity monitoring); vulnerability management; penetration testing; security incident response and management; and any other elements of information security included in generally accepted best practices.

    (3)  This category includes, but is not limited to: Regular, periodic testing and review of business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities, the controls and capabilities described in paragraph (a), (d), (e), (f), and (k) of this section; and any other elements of business continuity-disaster recovery planning and resources included in generally accepted best practices.

    (4)  This category includes, but is not limited to: Controls for monitoring the swap data repository's systems to ensure adequate scalable capacity (including testing, monitoring, and analysis of current and projected future capacity and performance, and of possible capacity degradation due to planned automated system changes); and any other elements of capacity and performance planning included in generally accepted best practices.

    (5)  This category includes, but is not limited to: System maintenance; configuration management (including baseline configuration, configuration change and patch management, least functionality, inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices and software); event and problem response and management; and any other elements of system operations included in generally accepted best practices.

    (6)  This category includes, but is not limited to: Requirements development; pre-production and regression testing; change management procedures and approvals; outsourcing and vendor management; training in secure coding practices; and any other elements of systems development and quality assurance included in generally accepted best practices.

    (c) In addressing the categories of risk analysis and oversight required under paragraph (b) of this section, a swap data repository shall follow generally accepted standards and best practices with respect to the development, operation, reliability, security, and capacity of automated systems.

    (d) A swap data repository shall maintain a business continuity-disaster recovery plan and business continuity-disaster recovery resources, emergency procedures, and backup facilities sufficient to enable timely recovery and resumption of its operations and resumption of its ongoing fulfillment of its duties and obligations as a swap data repository following any disruption of its operations. Such duties and obligations include, without limitation, the duties set forth in §§ 49.10 through 49.18, 49.23, and the core principles set forth in §§ 49.19 through 49.21 and §§ 49.25 through 49.27, and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail. The swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan and resources generally should enable resumption of the swap data repository's operations and resumption of ongoing fulfillment of the swap data repository's duties and obligation during the next business day following the disruption. A swap data repository shall update its business continuity-disaster recovery plan and emergency procedures at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but at a minimum no less frequently than annually.

    (e) Swap data repositories determined by the Commission to be critical swap data repositories are subject to more stringent requirements as set forth below.

    (1) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a disaster recovery plan and business continuity and disaster recovery resources, including infrastructure and personnel, sufficient to enable it to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event that its normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.

    (2) A same-day recovery time objective is a recovery time objective within the same business day on which normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.

    (3) To ensure its ability to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption, each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a degree of geographic dispersal of both infrastructure and personnel such that:

    (i) Infrastructure sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective after interruption is located outside the relevant area of the infrastructure the entity normally relies upon to conduct activities necessary to the reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination of SDR data, and does not rely on the same critical transportation, telecommunications, power, water, or other critical infrastructure components the entity normally relies upon for such activities; and

    (ii) Personnel sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective, after interruption of normal SDR data reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination by a wide-scale disruption affecting the relevant area in which the personnel the entity normally relies upon to engage in such activities are located, live and work outside that relevant area.

    (4) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must conduct regular, periodic tests of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans and resources and its capacity to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption. The swap data repository shall keep records of the results of such tests, and make the results available to the Commission upon request.

    (f) A swap data repository that is not determined by the Commission to be a critical swap data repository satisfies the requirement to be able to resume operations and resume ongoing fulfillment of the swap data repository's duties and obligations during the next business day following a disruption by maintaining either:

    (1) Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are sufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations, duties and obligations as a swap data repository following any disruption of its operations; or

    (2) Contractual arrangements with other swap data repositories or disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, that are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of all of the swap data repository's duties and obligations following any disruption of its operations, both with respect to all swaps reported to the swap data repository and with respect to all SDR data contained in the swap data repository.

    (g) A swap data repository shall notify Commission staff promptly of all:

    (1) Systems malfunctions;

    (2) Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or potentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity; and

    (3) Any activation of the swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan.

    (h) A swap data repository shall give Commission staff timely advance notice of all:

    (1) Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the reliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems; and

    (2) Planned changes to the swap data repository's program of risk analysis and oversight.

    (i) As part of a swap data repository's obligation to produce books and records in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter, and § 49.12, a swap data repository shall provide to the Commission the following system safeguards-related books and records, promptly upon the request of any Commission representative:

    (1) Current copies of its business continuity-disaster recovery plans and other emergency procedures;

    (2) All assessments of its operational risks or system safeguards-related controls;

    (3) All reports concerning system safeguards testing and assessment required by this chapter, whether performed by independent contractors or by employees of the swap data repository; and

    (4) All other books and records requested by Commission staff in connection with Commission oversight of system safeguards pursuant to the Act or Commission regulations, or in connection with Commission maintenance of a current profile of the swap data repository's automated systems.

    (5) Nothing in paragraph (i) of this section shall be interpreted as reducing or limiting in any way a swap data repository's obligation to comply with § 1.31 of this chapter, or with § 49.12.

    (j) A swap data repository shall conduct regular, periodic, objective testing and review of its automated systems to ensure that they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. It shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and review of its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities. Such testing and review shall include, without limitation, all of the types of testing set forth in this paragraph.

    (1)  As used in this paragraph (j):

    means the safeguards or countermeasures employed by the swap data repository in order to protect the reliability, security, or capacity of its automated systems or the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its SDR data and SDR information, and in order to enable the swap data repository to fulfill its statutory and regulatory duties and responsibilities.

    means assessment of the swap data repository's controls to determine whether such controls are implemented correctly, are operating as intended, and are enabling the swap data repository to meet the requirements established by this section.

    means a written assessment that includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of threats and vulnerabilities in the context of mitigating controls. An enterprise technology risk assessment identifies, estimates, and prioritizes risks to swap data repository operations or assets, or to market participants, individuals, or other entities, resulting from impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SDR data and SDR information or the reliability, security, or capacity of automated systems.

    means attempts to penetrate the swap data repository's automated systems from outside the systems' boundaries to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Methods of conducting external penetration testing include, but are not limited to, methods for circumventing the security features of an automated system.

    means attempts to penetrate the swap data repository's automated systems from inside the systems' boundaries, to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Methods of conducting internal penetration testing include, but are not limited to, methods for circumventing the security features of an automated system.

    means those controls that an appropriate risk analysis determines are either critically important for effective system safeguards or intended to address risks that evolve or change more frequently and therefore require more frequent review to ensure their continuing effectiveness in addressing such risks.

    means a cyber security or physical security event that actually jeopardizes or has a significant likelihood of jeopardizing automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity, or the availability, confidentiality, or integrity of SDR data.

    means a written plan documenting the swap data repository's policies, controls, procedures, and resources for identifying, responding to, mitigating, and recovering from security incidents, and the roles and responsibilities of its management, staff and independent contractors in responding to security incidents. A security incident response plan may be a separate document or a business continuity-disaster recovery plan section or appendix dedicated to security incident response.

    means testing of a swap data repository's security incident response plan to determine the plan's effectiveness, identify its potential weaknesses or deficiencies, enable regular plan updating and improvement, and maintain organizational preparedness and resiliency with respect to security incidents. Methods of conducting security incident response plan testing may include, but are not limited to, checklist completion, walk-through or table-top exercises, simulations, and comprehensive exercises.

    means testing of a swap data repository's automated systems to determine what information may be discoverable through a reconnaissance analysis of those systems and what vulnerabilities may be present on those systems.

    (2)  A swap data repository shall conduct vulnerability testing of a scope sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (i) A swap data repository shall conduct such vulnerability testing at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but no less frequently than quarterly.

    (ii) Such vulnerability testing shall include automated vulnerability scanning, which shall follow generally accepted best practices.

    (iii) A swap data repository shall conduct vulnerability testing by engaging independent contractors or by using employees of the swap data repository who are not responsible for development or operation of the systems or capabilities being tested.

    (4)  A swap data repository shall conduct internal penetration testing of a scope sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (i) A swap data repository shall conduct such internal penetration testing at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but no less frequently than annually.

    (ii) A swap data repository shall conduct internal penetration testing by engaging independent contractors, or by using employees of the swap data repository who are not responsible for development or operation of the systems or capabilities being tested.

    (5)  A swap data repository shall conduct controls testing of a scope sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (i) A swap data repository shall conduct controls testing, which includes testing of each control included in its program of risk analysis and oversight, at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis. Such testing may be conducted on a rolling basis. A swap data repository shall conduct testing of its key controls no less frequently than every three years. The swap data repository may conduct testing of its key controls on a rolling basis over the course of three years or the period determined by such risk analysis, whichever is shorter.

    (ii) A swap data repository shall engage independent contractors to test and assess the key controls included in its program of risk analysis and oversight no less frequently than every three years. The swap data repository may conduct any other controls testing required by this section by using independent contractors or employees of the swap data repository who are not responsible for development or operation of the systems or capabilities being tested.

    (6)  A swap data repository shall conduct security incident response plan testing sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (i) A swap data repository shall conduct such security incident response plan testing at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but no less frequently than annually.

    (ii) A swap data repository's security incident response plan shall include, without limitation, the swap data repository's definition and classification of security incidents, its policies and procedures for reporting security incidents and for internal and external communication and information sharing regarding security incidents, and the hand-off and escalation points in its security incident response process.

    (iii) A swap data repository may coordinate its security incident response plan testing with other testing required by this section or with testing of its other business continuity-disaster recovery and crisis management plans.

    (iv) A swap data repository may conduct security incident response plan testing by engaging independent contractors or by using employees of the swap data repository.

    (7)  A swap data repository shall conduct enterprise technology risk assessment of a scope sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.

    (i) A swap data repository shall conduct an enterprise technology risk assessment at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but no less frequently than annually.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), a swap data repository shall have systems in place to continuously accept and promptly record all SDR data reported to the swap data repository as required in this chapter and, as applicable, publicly disseminate all swap transaction and pricing data reported to the swap data repository as required in part 43 of this chapter.

    (1) A swap data repository may establish normal closing hours to perform system maintenance during periods when, in the reasonable estimation of the swap data repository, the swap data repository typically receives the least amount of SDR data. A swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice of its normal closing hours to market participants and to the public.

    (2) A swap data repository may declare, on an ad hoc basis, special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours. A swap data repository shall schedule special closing hours during periods when, in the reasonable estimation of the swap data repository in the context of the circumstances prompting the special closing hours, the special closing hours will be the least disruptive to the swap data repository's SDR data reporting responsibilities. A swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice of its special closing hours to market participants and to the public whenever possible, and, if advance notice is not reasonably possible, shall provide notice of its special closing hours to market participants and to the public as soon as reasonably possible after declaring special closing hours.

    (b) A swap data repository shall comply with the requirements under part 40 of this chapter in adopting or amending normal closing hours and special closing hours.

    (c) During normal closing hours and special closing hours, a swap data repository shall have the capability to accept and hold in queue any and all SDR data reported to the swap data repository during the normal closing hours or special closing hours.

    (1) Upon reopening after normal closing hours or special closing hours, a swap data repository shall promptly process all SDR data received during normal closing hours or special closing hours, as required pursuant to this chapter, and, pursuant to part 43 of this chapter, publicly disseminate all swap transaction and pricing data reported to the swap data repository that was held in queue during the normal closing hours or special closing hours.

    (2) If at any time during normal closing hours or special closing hours a swap data repository is unable to receive and hold in queue any SDR data reported pursuant to this chapter, then the swap data repository shall immediately issue notice to all swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, reporting counterparties, and the public that it is unable to receive and hold in queue SDR data. Immediately upon reopening, the swap data repository shall issue notice to all swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, reporting counterparties, and the public that it has resumed normal operations. Any swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that was obligated to report SDR data pursuant to this chapter to the swap data repository, but could not do so because of the swap data repository's inability to receive and hold in queue SDR data, shall report the SDR data to the swap data repository immediately after receiving such notice.

      (2) If there is more than one electing counterparty to a swap, the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be provided with respect to each of the electing counterparties.

      (b)  (1) When a counterparty elects the exception to the clearing requirement under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Act, one of the counterparties to the swap (the “reporting counterparty,” as determined in accordance with § 45.8 of this part) shall provide, or cause to be provided, the following information to a registered swap data repository or, if no registered swap data repository is available to receive the information from the reporting counterparty, to the Commission, in the form and manner specified by the Commission:

      () Exempt from the definition of “financial entity” as described in § 50.53;

      (B) Whether the swap or swaps for which the electing counterparty is electing the exception are used by the electing counterparty to hedge or mitigate commercial risk as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;

      (C) How the electing counterparty generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps by identifying one or more of the following categories, as applicable:

      () A written credit support agreement;

      () Pledged or segregated assets (including posting or receiving margin pursuant to a credit support agreement or otherwise);

      (2) An entity that qualifies for an exception to the clearing requirement under this section may report the information listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section annually in anticipation of electing the exception for one or more swaps. Any such reporting under this paragraph shall be effective for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for swaps entered into by the entity for 365 days following the date of such reporting. During such period, the entity shall amend such information as necessary to reflect any material changes to the information reported.

      (3) Each reporting counterparty shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the electing counterparty meets the requirements for an exception to the clearing requirement under this section.

      (c)  For purposes of section 2(h)(7)(A)(ii) of the Act and paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, a swap is used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk if:

      (1) Such swap:

      (i) Is economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise, where the risks arise from:

      (E) Any potential change in value related to any of the foregoing arising from interest, currency, or foreign exchange rate movements associated with such assets, liabilities, services, inputs, products, or commodities; or

      (F) Any fluctuation in interest, currency, or foreign exchange rate exposures arising from a person's current or anticipated assets or liabilities; or

      (A) Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as Statement No. 133); or

      (B) Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments; and

      (2) Such swap is:

      (i) Not used for a purpose that is in the nature of speculation, investing, or trading; and

      (ii) Not used to hedge or mitigate the risk of another swap or security-based swap position, unless that other position itself is used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk as defined by this rule or § 240.3a67-4 of this title.

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      § 75.12   Permitted investment in a covered fund.

#### § § 75.12

      (a)  (1) Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in § 75.10(a), a banking entity may acquire and retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that the banking entity or an affiliate thereof organizes and offers pursuant to § 75.11, for the purposes of:

      (B) An investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in a c_o_vered fund that is an issuing entity of asset-backed securities may not exceed 3 percent of the total fair market value of the ownership interests of the fund measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless a greater percentage is retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in compliance with the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder, in which case the investment by the banking entity and its affiliates in the covered fund may not exceed the amount, number, or value of ownership interests of the fund required under section 15G of the Exchange Act and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.

      (iii)  The aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired or retained under this section may not exceed 3 percent of the tier 1 capital of the banking entity, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter.

      (2)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) or (4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (ii)(A) of this section:

      (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment);

      (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment). If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;

      (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (3)  In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section:

      (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or

      (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.

      (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes.

      (iv) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (4) —(i)  If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the “feeder fund”) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the “master fund”), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entity's permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund. The banking entity's permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and

      (ii)  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11 for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a “fund of funds”) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entity's permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the fund that is held through the fund of funds. The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.

      (5)  (i) A banking entity shall not be required to include in the calculation of the investment limits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (ii) A banking entity shall not be restricted under this section in the amount of any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (ii) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (2) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (e) —(1)  Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.

      (iv) The total exposure of the covered banking entity to the investment and the risks that disposing of, or maintaining, the investment in the covered fund may pose to the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States;

      (v) The cost to the banking entity of divesting or disposing of the investment within the applicable period;

      (vi) Whether the investment or the divestiture or conformance of the investment would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and unaffiliated parties, including clients, customers, or counterparties to which it owes a duty;

      (vii) The banking entity's prior efforts to reduce through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods its ownership interests in the covered fund, including activities related to the marketing of interests in such covered fund;

      (viii) Market conditions; and

      (ix) Any other factor that the Board believes appropriate.

      (4)  The Board may impose such conditions on any extension approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States, address material conflicts of interest or other unsound banking practices, or otherwise further the purposes of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.

      (5)  In the case of a banking entity that is primarily regulated by another Federal banking agency, the SEC, or the CFTC, the Board will consult with such agency prior to acting on an application by the banking entity for an extension under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (i) The banking entity has established and implements, maintains and enforces an internal compliance program in accordance with subpart D of this part that is reasonably designed to ensure the banking entity's compliance with the requirements of this section, including:

      (A) Reasonably designed written policies and procedures; and

      (B) Internal controls and ongoing monitoring, management, and authorization procedures, including relevant escalation procedures; and

      (ii) The acquisition or retention of the ownership interest:

      (A) Is made in accordance with the written policies, procedures, and internal controls required under this section;

      (B) At the inception of the hedge, is designed to reduce or otherwise significantly mitigate one or more specific, identifiable risks arising:

      () Out of a transaction conducted solely to accommodate a specific customer request with respect to the covered fund; or

      () In connection with the compensation arrangement with the employee that directly provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, or other services to the covered fund;

      (C) Does not give rise, at the inception of the hedge, to any significant new or additional risk that is not itself hedged contemporaneously in accordance with this section; and

      (D) Is subject to continuing review, monitoring and management by the banking entity.

      (iii) With respect to risk-mitigating hedging activity conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the compensation arrangement relates solely to the covered fund in which the banking entity or any affiliate has acquired an ownership interest pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) and such compensation arrangement provides that any losses incurred by the banking entity on such ownership interest will be offset by corresponding decreases in amounts payable under such compensation arrangement.

      (b)  (1) The prohibition contained in § 75.10(a) does not apply to the acquisition or retention of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund by a banking entity only if:

      (B) With respect to a banking entity that is not a foreign banking organization, the banking entity is not organized under the laws of the United States or of one or more States and the banking entity, on a fully-consolidated basis, meets at least two of the following requirements:

      () Total assets of the banking entity held outside of the United States exceed total assets of the banking entity held in the United States;

      () Total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity outside of the United States exceed total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity in the United States; or

      (iii) The investment or sponsorship, including any transaction arising from risk-mitigating hedging related to an ownership interest, is not accounted for as principal directly or indirectly on a consolidated basis by any branch or affiliate that is located in the United States or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State.

      (5) For purposes of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank, or any subsidiary thereof, is located in the United States; however, a foreign bank of which that branch, agency, or subsidiary is a part is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operation of the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (iii) Would not otherwise be a banking entity except by virtue of the acquisition or retention of an ownership interest in, sponsorship of, or relationship with the entity, by another banking entity that meets the following:

      (A) The banking entity is not organized, or directly or indirectly controlled by a banking entity that is organized, under the laws of the United States or of any State; and

      (B) The banking entity's acquisition of an ownership interest in or sponsorship of the fund by the foreign banking entity meets the requirements for permitted covered fund activities and investments solely outside the United States, as provided in § 75.13(b);

#### § § 75.14

      (a)  (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 75.11(b), and no affiliate of such entity, may enter into a transaction with the covered fund, or with any other covered fund that is controlled by such covered fund, that would be a covered transaction as defined in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b)(7)), as if such banking entity and the affiliate thereof were a member bank and the covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a banking entity may:

      (i) Acquire and retain any ownership interest in a covered fund in accordance with the requirements of § 75.11, § 75.12, or § 75.13;

      (A) The banking entity is in compliance with each of the limitations set forth in § 75.11 with respect to a covered fund organized and offered by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof);

      (B) The chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) of the banking entity certifies in writing annually no later than March 31 to the CFTC (with a duty to update the certification if the information in the certification materially changes) that the banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee, assume, or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such covered fund invests; and

      (C) The Board has not determined that such transaction is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation and condition of the banking entity; and

      (C) The banking entity making each extension of credit meets the requirements of § 223.42(l)(1)(i) and (ii) of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42(l)(1)(i) and(ii)), as if the extension of credit was an intraday extension of credit, regardless of the duration of the extension of credit.

      (3) Any transaction or activity permitted under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (iv) or (v) must comply with the limitations in § 75.15.

      (b)  A banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, or that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 75.11(b), shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1), as if such banking entity were a member bank and such covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      § 75.15   Other limitations on permitted covered fund activities.

#### § § 75.15

      (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 75.11 through 75.13 if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:

      (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

      (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or

      (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;

      (2) The banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in Qualifying TruPS Collateral; and

      (3) The banking entity acquired such interest on or before December 10, 2013 (or acquired such interest in connection with a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that acquired the interest on or before December 10, 2013).

      (b) For purposes of this § 75.16,  shall mean any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that, as of the end of any reporting period within 12 months immediately preceding the issuance of such trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument, had total consolidated assets of less than $15,000,000,000 or issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a mutual holding company.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a banking entity may act as a market maker with respect to the interests of an issuer described in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§ 75.4 and 75.11.

      (d) Without limiting the applicability of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board, the FDIC and the OCC will make public a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of paragraph (a). A banking entity may rely on the list published by the Board, the FDIC and the OCC.

      (3) For each seeding vehicle described in § 75.10(c)(12)(i) or (iii) that will become a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company, a written plan documenting the banking entity's determination that the seeding vehicle will become a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company; the period of time during which the vehicle will operate as a seeding vehicle; and the banking entity's plan to market the vehicle to third-party investors and convert it into a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company within the time period specified in § 75.12(a)(2)(i)(B);

      (4) For any banking entity that is, or is controlled directly or indirectly by a banking entity that is, located in or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, if the aggregate amount of ownership interests in foreign public funds that are described in § 75.10(c)(1) owned by such banking entity (including ownership interests owned by any affiliate that is controlled directly or indirectly by a banking entity that is located in or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State) exceeds $50 million at the end of two or more consecutive calendar quarters, beginning with the next succeeding calendar quarter, documentation of the value of the ownership interests owned by the banking entity (and such affiliates) in each foreign public fund and each jurisdiction in which any such foreign public fund is organized, calculated as of the end of each calendar quarter, which documentation must continue until the banking entity's aggregate amount of ownership interests in foreign public funds is below $50 million for two consecutive calendar quarters; and

      (5) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign banking entity is located in the United States; however, the foreign bank that operates or controls that branch, agency, or subsidiary is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operating or controlling the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (f) —(1)  A banking entity that does not engage in activities or investments pursuant to subpart B or subpart C of this part (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 75.6(a)) may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing the required compliance program prior to becoming engaged in such activities or making such investments (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 75.6(a)).

      (2)  A banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities may satisfy the requirements of this section by including in its existing compliance policies and procedures appropriate references to the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and adjustments as appropriate given the activities, size, scope, and complexity of the banking entity.

      (g) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a banking entity with limited trading assets and liabilities shall be presumed to be compliant with subpart B and subpart C of this part and shall have no obligation to demonstrate compliance with this part on an ongoing basis.

      (2)  If upon examination or audit, the CFTC determines that the banking entity has engaged in proprietary trading or covered fund activities that are otherwise prohibited under subpart B or subpart C of this part, the CFTC may require the banking entity to be treated under this part as if it did not have limited trading assets and liabilities. The CFTC's rebuttal of the presumption in this paragraph must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the CFTC retains its authority to require a banking entity without significant trading assets and liabilities to apply any requirements of this part that would otherwise apply if the banking entity had significant or moderate trading assets and liabilities if the CFTC determines that the size or complexity of the banking entity's trading or investment activities, or the risk of evasion of subpart B or subpart C, of this part does not warrant a presumption of compliance under paragraph (g) of this section or treatment as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities, as applicable. The CFTC's exercise of this reservation of authority must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (i) —(1)  The CFTC will notify the banking entity in writing of any determination requiring notice under this part and will provide an explanation of the determination.

      (2)  The banking entity may respond to any or all items in the notice described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The response should include any matters that the banking entity would have the CFTC consider in deciding whether to make the determination. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated CFTC official within 30 days after the date on which the banking entity received the notice. The CFTC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the CFTC, the activities or condition of the banking entity so requires, provided that the banking entity is informed of the time period at the time of notice, or with the consent of the banking entity. In its discretion, the CFTC may extend the time period for good cause.

      (3)  Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the CFTC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the CFTC's determination.

      (4)  The CFTC will notify the banking entity of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision.

A no-action letter represents the position only of the Division that issued it, or the Office of the General Counsel if issued thereby. A no-action letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and not the Commission or other Commission staff. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the no-action letter.

      (3)  means written advice or guidance issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission or the Office of the General Counsel. An interpretative letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and does not bind the Commission or other Commission staff.

      (4)  means an exemptive, no-action or interpretative letter.

      (5)  means the Market Participants _Division_, the Division of Clearing and Risk, the Division of Market Oversight, the Division of Data, or the Office of the General Counsel, or any successor divisions or organizational units, as the context requires.

      (b)  (1) Issuance of a Letter is entirely within the discretion of Commission staff.

      (2) Each request for a Letter must comply with the requirements of this section. Commission staff may reject or decline to respond to a request that does not comply with the requirements of this section.

      (3) The request must relate to a proposed transaction or a proposed activity. Absent extraordinary circumstances, Commission staff will not issue a Letter based upon transactions or activities that have been completed or activities that have been conducted prior to the date upon which the request is filed with the Commission.

      (4) The request must be made by or on behalf of the person whose activities or transactions are the subject of the request. Commission staff will not respond to a request for a Letter that is made by or on behalf of an unidentified person.

      (5)(i) The request must set forth as completely as possible all material facts and circumstances giving rise to the request.

      (ii) Commission staff will not respond to a request based on a hypothetical situation. However, a requester may set forth one or more alternative structures or fact situations for a proposed transaction or activity;  That the request complies with this section with respect to each alternative structure or fact situation.

      (c)  Each request for a Letter must comply with the following information requirements:

      (1)(i) A request made by the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought must contain:

      (A) The name, main business address, main telephone number and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of such person; and

      (B) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of each other person for whose benefit the person is seeking the Letter.

      (ii) When made by a requester other than the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought, the request must contain:

      (A) The name, main business address and main business telephone number of the requester;

      (B) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought; and

      (C) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of each other person for whose benefit the requester is seeking the Letter.

      (iii) The request must provide the name, address and telephone number of a contact person from whom Commission staff may obtain additional information if necessary.

      (2) The section number of the particular provision of the Act and/or Commission rules, regulations or orders to which the request relates must be set forth in the upper right-hand corner of the first page of the request.

      (3) The request must be accompanied by:

      (i) A certification by a person with knowledge of the facts that the material facts as represented in the request are true and complete. The following form of certification is sufficient for this purpose:

      (ii) An undertaking made by the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought or by that person's authorized representative that, if at any time prior to issuance of a Letter, any material representation made in the request ceases to be true and complete, the person who made the undertaking will ensure that Commission staff is informed promptly in writing of all materially changed facts and circumstances. If a material change in facts or circumstances occurs subsequent to issuance of a Letter, the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought (or that person's authorized representative at the time of the change) must promptly so inform Commission staff.

      (4) The request must identify the type of relief requested and Letter sought and must clearly state why a Letter is needed. The request must identify all relevant legal and factual issues and discuss the legal and public policy bases supporting issuance of the Letter.

      (5) The request must contain references to all relevant authorities, including applicable provisions of the Act, Commission rules, regulations and orders, judicial decisions, administrative decisions, relevant statutory interpretations and policy statements. Adverse authority must be cited and discussed.

      (6) The request must identify prior publicly available Letters issued by Commission staff in response to circumstances similar to those surrounding the request (including adverse Letters), and must identify any conditions imposed by prior Letters as prerequisites for the issuance of those Letters. Citation of a representative sample of prior Letters is sufficient where a comprehensive recitation of prior Letters on a given topic would be repetitious or would not assist the staff in considering the request.

      (7) Requests may ask that, if the requested exemptive relief, no-action position or interpretative guidance is denied, the staff consider granting alternative relief or adopting an alternative position.

      (d)  Each request for a Letter must comply with the following filing requirements:

      (1) The request must be in writing and signed.

      (2)(i)(A) A request for a letter relating to the provisions of the Act or the Commission's rules, regulations, or orders issued thereunder governing designated contract markets, registered swap execution facilities, registered swap data repositories, registered foreign boards of trade, the nature of particular transactions and whether they are exempt or excluded from being required to be traded on one of the foregoing entities, made available for trading determinations, position limits, hedging exemptions, the trading of block trades, or position aggregation treatment shall be filed with the Director, Division of Market Oversight, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters.

      (ii) A request for a Letter relating to the provisions of the Act or the Commission's rules, regulations or orders governing or related to derivatives clearing organizations and other central counterparties, the clearing process, the clearing requirement determination, Commission regulation 1.25 jointly with the Director of the Market Participants Division, risk assessment, financial surveillance, the end user exemption, and bankruptcy shall be filed with the Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters.

      (iii) A request for a Letter relating to all other provisions of the Act or Commission rules, including Commission regulation 1.25 jointly with the Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, shall be filed with the Director of the Market Participants Division at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters.

      (iv) The requests described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section must be submitted electronically using the email address  (for a request filed with the Division of Market Oversight),  (for a request filed with the Division of Clearing and Risk), or  (for a request filed with the Division of Data), or  (for a request filed with the Market Participants Division), as appropriate, and a properly signed paper copy of the request must be provided to the Division of Market Oversight, the Division of Data, the Division of Clearing and Risk, or the Market Participants Division, as appropriate, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable, within ten days for purposes of verification of the electronic submission.

      (e)  No response to any request governed by this section is effective unless it is in writing, signed by appropriate Commission staff, and transmitted in final form to the recipient. Failure by Commission staff to respond to a request for a Letter does not constitute approval of the request. Nothing in this section shall preclude Commission staff from responding to a request for a Letter by way of endorsement or any other abbreviated, written form of response.

      (f)  (1) A request for a Letter may be withdrawn by filing with Commission staff a written request for withdrawal, signed by the person on whose behalf the Letter was sought or by that person's authorized representative, that states whether the person on whose behalf the Letter was sought will proceed with the proposed transaction or activity.

      (2) Where a request has been submitted by an authorized representative of the person on whose behalf a Letter is sought, the authorized representative may withdraw from representation at any time without explanation,  That Commission staff is promptly so notified.

      (g)  In the event that Commission staff requests additional information or analysis from a requester and the requester does not provide that information or analysis within thirty calendar days, Commission staff generally will issue a denial of the request;  that Commission staff in its discretion may issue an extension of time to provide the information and or analysis.

      (h)  Confidential treatment of a request for a Letter must be requested separately in accordance with § 140.98 or § 145.9 of this chapter, as applicable.

      (i)  The provisions of this section shall not affect the requirements of, or otherwise be applicable to:

      (1) Have a financial interest, through ownership of securities or otherwise, in any person   registered with the Commission (including futures commission merchants, associated persons and agents of futures commission merchants, floor brokers, commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators, and any other persons required to be registered in a fashion similar to any of the above under the Commodity Exchange Act or pursuant to any rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission), or any contract market, swap execution facility, swap data repository, board of trade, or other trading facility, or any derivatives clearing organization subject to regulation or oversight by the Commission;

      (d)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a member or employee, or a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee, from:

      (1) Retaining a financial interest that was permitted to be retained by the member or employee prior to the adoption of this regulation, was obtained prior to the commencement of employment with the Commission, or was acquired by a spouse prior to marriage to the member or employee; or

      (ii) Makes full written disclosure to the General Counsel within 30 days of commencing employment or, for incumbents, within twenty days of his or her receipt of actual or constructive notice that the interest has been acquired;   and

      (iii) Will be disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, and 18 U.S.C. 208 from participating in any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question. Any Commission member or employee affected by this section may, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and 5 CFR 2640.301-303, request a waiver of the disqualification requirement.

      (e)  This section shall not apply to the financial interests of a legally separated spouse of a Commission member or employee, including transactions for the benefit of a minor child, if the member or employee has no power to control and does not, in fact, advise or control with respect to such transactions.

      (5)  means a retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of $140 or less, except as redefined to reflect changes in the consumer price index at three year intervals by the Administrator of General Services pursuant to authority granted in 5 U.S.C. 7342(a)(5)(A).

      (b) Commission members and employees shall not:

      (1) Request or otherwise encourage the tender of a gift or decoration;

      (2) Accept a gift of currency, except that which has an historical or numismatic value;

      (3) Accept gifts of travel or gifts of expenses for travel, such as transportation, food and lodging, from foreign governments, other than those authorized in paragraph (c)(5) of this section; or

      (4) Accept any gift or decoration, except as authorized by this section.

      (c) Gifts which may be accepted:

      (1) Commission members and employees may accept and retain gifts of minimal value tendered or received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy from a foreign government without further approval. If the value of a gift is uncertain, the recipient shall be responsible for establishing that it is of minimal value, as defined in this section. Documentary evidence may be required in support of the valuation.

      (2) Commission members and employees may accept, on behalf of the United States, gifts of more than minimal value tendered or received from a foreign government when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. When a tangible gift of more than minimal value is accepted on behalf of the United States, it becomes the property of the United States.

      (3) Commission members and employees may accept a gift of more than minimal value where such gift is in the nature of an educational scholarship or medical treatment.

      (4) Within 60 days after accepting a tangible gift of more than minimal value, other than a gift described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a Commission member or employee shall file a statement with the Executive Director of the Commission which shall include the following information:

      (A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;

      (B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justify acceptance;

      (C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift;

      (D) The date of acceptance of the gift;

      (E) The estimated value in the United States of the gift at the time of acceptance; and

      (F) The disposition or current location of the gift.

      (5) Commission members and employees are authorized to accept from a foreign government gifts of travel or gifts of expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States, such as transportation, food and lodging, of more than minimal value if the acceptance is approved by the Executive Director, upon a finding that it is consistent with the interests of the Commission. Either prior to or within 30 days after accepting each gift of travel or gift of travel expenses pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission member or employee concerned shall file a statement with the Executive Director containing the following information:

      (A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;

      (B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance;

      (C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift; and

      (d) Commission members or employees may accept, retain and wear decorations tendered by a foreign government in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, subject to the approval of the Executive Director. Without this approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States, shall become the property of the United States, and shall be deposited by the employee, within 60 days of acceptance, with the Executive Director for official use or forwarding to the Administrator of General Services for disposal in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that a Commission member or employee will be notified of the intent of a foreign government to award him or her or a spouse or dependent a decoration for outstanding or unusually meritorious service sufficiently in advance so that the approval required can be sought prior to its acceptance. A request for the approval of the Executive Director shall be submitted in writing, stating the nature of the decoration and the reason why it is being awarded. Whenever possible, the request should also be accompanied by a statement from the foreign government, preferably in the form of the citation, which shows the basis for the tender of the award, whether it is in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.

      (e) Within 60 days after acceptance of a tangible gift of more than minimal value or a decoration for which the Executive Director has not given approval, a Commission member or employee shall:

      (1) Deposit the gift or decoration for disposal with the Executive Director; or

      (2) Subject to the approval of the Commission, upon the recommendation of the Executive Director, deposit the gift or decoration with the Commission for official use.

      (f) Whenever possible, gifts and decorations that have been deposited with the Executive Director for disposal shall be returned to the donor. The Executive Director, in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, shall examine the circumstances surrounding the donation, assessing whether any adverse effect on the foreign relations of the United States might result from the return of the gift or decoration to the donor. The appropriate Department of State officials shall be consulted if a question of adverse effect on United States foreign relations arises.

      (g) Gifts and decorations that have not been returned to the donor, retained for official use, or for which official use has terminated, shall be forwarded by the Executive Director to the Administrator of General Services for transfer, donation, or other disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 7342.

      (h) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7342(h), the U.S. Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court against any Commission member or employee who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government not consented to by the Congress of the United States in 5 U.S.C. 7342, or who fails to deposit or report such gift as required by 5 U.S.C. 7342. The court may assess a penalty against such Commission member or employee in any amount not exceeding the retail value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus $5,000.

      (i) A violation of the requirements set forth in this section by a Commission employee may be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.

      (j)(1) The burden of proving minimal value shall be on the recipient. In the event of a dispute over the value of a gift, the Executive Director shall arrange for an outside appraiser to determine whether the gift is of more or less than minimal value.

      (2) When requested by the Administrator of Government Services, the Executive Director shall arrange for an appraisal of a gift or decoration.

      (k) No appropriated funds of the Commission may be used to buy any tangible gift of more than minimal value for any foreign individual, unless the gift has been approved by Congress.

This part is intended to provide indemnification for adverse judgments for constitutional and federal statutory torts excepted from the Federal Tort Claims Act exclusive remedy provision 28 U.S.C. 2679(b) (as amended by the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-694)). In any lawsuit which is filed against the employee alleging a common law tort occurring within the scope of employment, the United States may be substituted for the individual employee and any liability which may be found will be assessed against the government, pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988.

    § 142.2   Policy.

#### § § 142.2

    (a) The Commission may indemnify its employees by the payment of available funds, in whole, or in part, for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Commission and that such indemnification is in the interest of the United States, as determined by the Commission.

    (b) The Commission may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against its employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment and that such settlement is in the interest of the United States as determined by the Commission in its discretion.

    (c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Commission, the Commission will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.

    (d) When an employee of the Commission becomes aware that an action may be or has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the Commission's Office of the General Counsel that such an action is pending or threatened.

    (e) The employee may thereafter request either (1) indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or award entered against the employee or (2) payment to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal. The employee shall submit a written request, with documentation including copies of the verdict, judgment, award or settlement proposal, as appropriate, to the head of his or her division or office, who thereupon shall submit to the General Counsel, in a timely manner, a recommended disposition of the request. The General Counsel shall also seek the views of the Department of Justice. The General Counsel shall forward the request, the division or office's recommendation and the General Counsel's recommendation to the Commission for decision.

    (f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Commodity Futures Trading Commission employee or to settle a personal damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

#### § § 143.3

      (a) The Commission will assess interest on unpaid claims. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury ( the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness.

      (c) The Commission may waive in whole or in part interest, penalty charges or administrative costs if it finds that:

      (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum within a reasonable period of time;

      (a) Whenever feasible, the Commission will collect claims under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor.

    § 145.7   Requests for Commission records and copies thereof.

#### § § 145.7

    Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission will accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission will respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.

    (a)  Information concerning the nature and extent of available public records may be obtained in person, by telephone, via Internet (), or by writing to the Commission offices designated in §§ 145.2 and 145.6.

    (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to public records, all requests for records maintained by the Commission shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Office of the General Counsel of the Commission and shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”

    (c)  The Commission cannot ensure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to requests for records that are directed to the Commission other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Any misdirected written request for nonpublic records should be promptly forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel of the Commission. Misdirected requests for nonpublic records will be considered to have been received for purposes of this section only when they actually have been received by the Office of the General Counsel.

    (d)  Each written request for Commission records made under paragraph (b) of this section shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to permit the records to be located among the records maintained by or for the Commission. The Commission staff may communicate with the requester (by telephone when practicable) in an effort to reduce the administrative burden of processing a broad request and to minimize fees for copying and search services.

    (e)  In each request for records, requesters shall reasonable identify themselves as a commercial user, educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media if one of these categories is applicable. The requester shall describe the use to which the records will be put.

    (f)  The Commission's response to a request for nonpublic records will encompass all nonpublic records identifiable as responsive to the request that are in existence on the date that the written request is received by the Office of the General Counsel. The Commission need not create a new record in response to a FOIA request.

    (g)  A request for copies of records pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must indicate the requester's agreement to pay all fees that are associated with the processing of the request, in accordance with the rates set forth in appendix B to this part, or the requester's intention to limit the fees incurred to a stated amount. If the requester states a fee limitation, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated amount. A requester who seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (b) of appendix B of this part must show that such a waiver or reduction would be in the public interest. If the Office of the General Counsel receives a request for records under paragraph (b) of this section from a requester who has not paid fees from a previous request in accordance with appendix B of this part, the staff will decline to process the request until such fees have been paid.

    (h)  (1) With respect to any request for nonpublic records as defined in § 145.0(c), the FOIA compliance staff of the Commission will forward the request to the Commission divisions or offices likely to maintain records that are responsive to the request. If a responsive record is located, the FOIA compliance staff will, in consultation with the Commission office in which the record was located, determine whether to comply with such request. The FOIA compliance staff may, in their discretion, determine whether to comply with any portion of a request for nonpublic records before considering the remainder of the request. The FOIA compliance staff will inform the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

    (2) Where it is determined to deny, in whole or in part, a request for nonpublic records, the FOIA compliance staff will notify the requester of the denial, citing applicable exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act or other provisions of law that require or allow the records to be withheld. The FOIA compliance staff's response to the FOIA request should describe in general terms what categories of documents are being withheld under which applicable FOIA exemption or exemptions. The FOIA compliance staff's response will include a statement notifying the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services. The FOIA compliance staff, in denying an initial request for records, is not required to provide the requester with an inventory of those documents determined to be exempt from disclosure.

    (3) The FOIA compliance staff will issue an initial determination with respect to a FOIA request within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of the General Counsel. In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, the prescribed time limit may be extended by written notice to the person making a request for a record or a copy. The notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. Where the extension exceeds ten business days, the FOIA compliance staff will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The FOIA compliance staff or the FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist the requester in unusual circumstances. The FOIA compliance staff will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of a particular request:

    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;

    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components in the Commission having substantial subject matter interest therein;

    (iv) The need to coordinate a response with several Commission offices;

    (v) The need to obtain records currently being used by members of the Commission, the Commission staff, or the public;

    (vi) The need to respond to a large number of previously-filed FOIA requests.

    (i)  (1) Any person who has been notified pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that his request for records has been denied in whole or in part may file an application for review as set forth below.

    (2) An application for review must be received by the Office of General the Counsel within 90 days of the date of the denial by the FOIA compliance staff. This 90-day period shall not begin to run until the FOIA compliance staff has issued an initial determination with respect to all portions of the request for nonpublic records. An application for review shall be in writing and shall be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. If the appeal involves information as to which the FOIA requester has received a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9(e), the requester must also serve a copy of the appeal on the submitter of the information.

    (3) The applicant must attach to the application for review a copy of all correspondence relevant to the request,  the initial request, any correspondence amending or modifying the request, and all correspondence from the staff responding to the request.

    (4) The application for review shall state such facts and cite such legal or other authorities as the applicant may consider appropriate. The application may, in addition, include a description of the general benefit to the public from disclosure of that information.

    (5) If the appeal involves information that is subject to a petition for confidential treatment filed under § 145.9, the submitter of the information shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing the appeal. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. Copies shall be sent to the person requesting the information.

    (6) The General Counsel, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to consider all appeals under this section from initial determinations of the FOIA compliance staff of the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her designee, may:

    (i) Determine either to affirm or to reverse the initial determination in whole or in part;

    (ii) Determine to disclose a record, even if exempt, if good cause for doing so either is shown by the application or otherwise appears;

    (iii) Remand the matter to the FOIA compliance staff—

    (A) To correct a deficiency in the initial processing of the request, or

    (B) When an investigation as to which the staff originally claimed exemption from mandatory disclosure on the basis of 5 U.S.C. 555(b)(7)(A) or 7 U.S.C. 12(a) is subsequently closed; or

    (iv) Refer the matter to the Commission for a decision.

    (7) If the initial denial of the request for nonpublic records is reversed, the Office of the General Counsel shall, in writing, advise the requester that the records will be available on or after a specified date. If, on appeal, the denial of access to a record is affirmed in whole or in part, the person who requested the information shall be notified in writing of:

    (i) The reasons for the denial,

    (ii) The mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and

    (iii) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) providing for judicial review of a determination to withhold records.

    (j)  A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term “compelling need” means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The FOIA compliance staff will determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of the General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the FOIA compliance staff. The Office of the General Counsel will respond to the appeal within ten days after the date of the appeal.

    § 145.8   Fees for records services.

#### § § 145.8

    A schedule of fees for record services, including locating, and making records available, and copying, appears in appendix B to this part. Copies of the schedule of fees may also be obtained upon request made in person, by telephone or by mail from the FOIA compliance staff or at any regional office of the Commission.

> [82 FR 28005, June 20, 2017, as amended at 89 FR 71817, Sept. 4, 2024]

    § 145.9   Petition for confidential treatment of information submitted to the Commission.

#### § § 145.9

    (a)  This section provides a procedure by which persons submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other context.

    (b)  The provisions of this section shall apply only where the Commission has not specified that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. See 40.8 for procedures to be utilized in connection with filing information required to be filed pursuant to 17 CFR parts 40 and 41.

    (c)  The following definitions apply to this section:

    (1)  A “submitter” is any person who submits any information or material to the Commission or who permits any information or material to be submitted to the Commission. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section only, “submitter” includes any person whose information has been submitted to a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association that in turn has submitted the information to the Commission.

    (2)  A “FOIA requester” is any person who files with the Commission a request to inspect or copy Commission records or documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

    (d)  (1) Any submitter may request in writing that the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act to any information that he or she submits to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no oral requests for confidential treatment will be accepted by the Commission. The submitter shall specify the grounds on which confidential treatment is being requested but need not provide a detailed written justification of the request unless required to do so under paragraph (e) of this section. Confidential treatment may be requested only on the grounds that disclosure:

    (i) Is specifically exempted by a statute that either requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.

    (ii) Would reveal the submitter's trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.

    (iii) Would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the submitter's personal privacy.

    (iv) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would deprive the submitter of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication.

    (v) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the submitter.

    (vi) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures,  that the claim may be made only by a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association with regard to its own investigatory records.

    (2) The original of any written request for confidential treatment must be sent to the Office of the General Counsel at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters, Attn: FOIA compliance staff. A copy of any request for confidential treatment shall be sent to the Commission division or office receiving the original of any material for which confidential treatment is being sought.

    (3) A request for confidential treatment shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the submitter. The submitter is responsible for informing the FOIA compliance staff of any changes in his or her name, address, and telephone number.

    (4) A request for confidential treatment should accompany the material for which confidential treatment is being sought. If a request for confidential treatment is filed after the filing of such material, the submitter shall have the burden of showing that it was not possible to request confidential treatment for that material at the time the material was filed. A request for confidential treatment of a future submission will not be processed. All records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page stating “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name].” If such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]” should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this matter should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable. In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be impractical to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or as soon thereafter as practicable, that the person is requesting confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit a written request for confidential treatment within 30 days of the submission of the information. If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act with respect to material for which no timely request for confidential treatment has been made, it may be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting that the material is confidential.

    (5) A request for confidential treatment shall state the length of time for which confidential treatment is being sought.

    (6) A request for confidential treatment (as distinguishing from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. When a submitter deems it necessary to include, in its request for confidential treatment, information for which it seeks confidential treatment, the submitter shall place that information in an appendix to the request.

    (7) On 10 business days notice from the FOIA compliance staff, a submitter shall submit a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Upon request and for good cause shown, the FOIA compliance staff may grant an extension of such time. The FOIA compliance staff will notify the submitter that failure to provide timely a detailed written justification will be deemed a waiver of the submitter's opportunity to appeal an adverse determination.

    (8)(i) Requests for confidential treatment for any reasonably segregable material that is not exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as implemented in § 145.5, shall be summarily rejected under § 145.9(d)(9). Requests for confidential treatment of public information contained in financial reports as specified in § 1.10 shall not be processed. A submitter has the burden of specifying clearly and precisely the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request. A submitter may be able to meet this burden in various ways, including:

    (A) Segregating material for which confidential treatment is being sought;

    (B) Submitting two copies of the submission: a copy from which material for which confidential treatment is being sought has been obliterated, deleted, or clearly marked and an unmarked copy; and

    (C) Clearly describing the material within a submission for which confidential treatment is being sought.

    (ii) A submitter shall not employ a method of specifying the material for which confidential treatment is being sought if that method makes it unduly difficult for the Commission to read the full submission, including all portion claimed to be confidential, in its entirely.

    (9) If a submitter fails to follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, the FOIA compliance staff may summarily reject the submitter's request for confidential treatment with leave to the submitter to refile a proper petition. Failure of the FOIA compliance staff summarily to reject a confidential treatment request pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed to indicate that the submitter has complied with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.

    (10) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, no determination with respect to any request for confidential treatment will be made until the Commission receives a Freedom of Information Act request for the material for which confidential treatment is being sought.

    (e)  (1) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a FOIA request seeks material for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to § 145.9, the FOIA compliance staff shall require the submitter to file a detailed written justification of the confidential request within ten business days (unless under § 145.9(d)(7) an extension of time has been granted) of that determination unless, pursuant to an earlier FOIA request, a prior determination to release or withhold the material has been made, the submitter has already provided sufficient information to grant the request for confidential treatment; or the material is otherwise in the public domain. The detailed written justification shall be filed with the FOIA compliance staff. It shall be clearly marked “Detailed Written Justification of FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the request number supplied by the Commission. The submitter shall also send a copy of the detailed written justification to the FOIA requester at the address specified by the Commission.

    (2) The period for filing a detailed written justification may be extended upon request and for good cause shown.

    (3) The detailed written justification of the confidential treatment request shall contain:

    (i) The reasons, referring to the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, why the information that is the subject of the FOIA request should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;

    (ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions that govern or may govern the treatment of the information;

    (iii) The existence and applicability of prior determinations by the Commission, other federal agencies, or courts concerning the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to which confidential treatment is being requested. Submitters shall satisfy any evidentiary burdens imposed upon them by applicable Freedom of Information Act case law.

    (iv) Such additional facts and authorities as the submitter may consider appropriate.

    (4) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request shall be accompanied by affidavits to the extent necessary to establish the facts necessary to satisfy the submitter's evidentiary burden.

    (5) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request (as distinguished from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. However, a submitter will be permitted to submit to the Commission supplementary confidential affidavits with his or her detailed written justification if that is the only way in which he or she can convincingly demonstrate that the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request should not be disclosed to the FOIA requester.

    (f)  (1) The FOIA compliance staff, in consultation with the Office in which the record was located, shall issue an initial determination with respect to a confidential treatment request for material that is responsive to the FOIA request. This determination shall be issued at the same time as the initial determination with respect to the FOIA request.  § 145.7(g). To the extent that the initial determination grants a confidential treatment request in full or in part, it should specify the FOIA exemptions upon which this determination is based and briefly describe the material to which each exemption applies.  § 145.7(g)(2). To the extent that the initial determination denies confidential treatment to any material for which confidential treatment was requested, it should briefly describe the material for which confidential treatment is denied.

    (2) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a confidential treatment request shall be denied in full or in part, the submitter shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The material for which confidential treatment was denied shall be released to the FOIA requester if the submitter does not file an appeal within 10 business days of the date on which his or her request was denied.

    (3) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a confidential treatment request shall be granted in full or in part, the FOIA requester shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 145.7(h).

    (g)  (1) An appeal from an initial determination to deny a confidential treatment request in full or in part shall be filed with the General Counsel of the Commission. No disclosure of the material that is the subject of the appeal shall be made until the appeal is resolved. If both a submitter and a FOIA requester appeal to the General Counsel from a partial grant and partial denial of a confidential treatment request, those appeals shall be consolidated.

    (2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.” The appeal shall include a copy of the initial determination and shall clearly indicate the portions of the initial determination from which an appeal is being taken.

    (3) The appeal shall be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the FOIA requester. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to consider all appeals from initial determinations of the FOIA compliance staff. The General Counsel may, in his sole and unfettered discretion, refer such appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the Commission for decision.

    (4) In the appeal, the submitter may supply additional substantiation for his or her request for confidential treatment, including additional affidavits and additional legal argument. Such submissions shall be governed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

    (5) The FOIA requester shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing of the FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal. The FOIA requester need not respond, however. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. A copy shall be sent to the submitter.

    (6) All FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeals and all responses thereto shall be considered public documents.

    (7) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of the General Counsel of such appeal or within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with the standards set forth in § 145.7(g)(3). Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible the General Counsel will decide the appeal on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the submitter and the FOIA requests.

    (8) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to remand any matter to the FOIA compliance staff to correct deficiencies in the initial processing of the confidential treatment request.

    (9) If the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a confidential treatment appeal in full or in part, the information for which confidential treatment is denied shall be disclosed to the FOIA requester 10 business days later, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (g)(10) of this section.

    (10) The General Counsel or their designee shall have the authority to enter and vacate stays as set forth below. If, within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a determination by the General Counsel or their designee to disclose information for which a submitter sought confidential treatment, the submitter commences an action in federal court concerning that determination, the General Counsel will stay the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel or their designee may vacate a stay entered under this section, either on his or her own motion or at the request of the FOIA requester. If such a stay is vacated, the information will be released to the requester 10 business days after the submitter is notified of this action, unless a court orders otherwise.

    (h)  Any time limit under this section may be extended for good cause shown, in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, or the FOIA compliance staff.

    (i) A submitter whose confidential treatment request has been upheld by the Commission shall, upon request of the General Counsel, aid the Commission in defending a court action to compel the Commission to disclose the information subject to the confidential treatment request. If the submitter is unwilling to aid the Commission in this regard, the General Counsel may, in appropriate cases, make the information available to the public.

Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.

    (b) In this part the Commission is also exempting certain Commission systems of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 that would otherwise be applicable to those systems. These exemptions are authorized under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).

    § 146.12   Exemptions.

#### § § 146.12

    The Commission is exempting from certain provisions of the Privacy Act the systems of records set forth in this section. In addition, when these systems of records and any other of the Commission's systems of records maintain a record received from another system of records that is exempted from one or more provisions of the Privacy Act, the Commission will claim the same exemptions for that record that are claimed for the system of records from which it originated.

    (a)  The system of records identified as CFTC-1 Enforcement Matter Register and Matter Indices contains an index and registry of enforcement investigations. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act and CFTC's rules promulgated thereunder are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.

    (4) From section (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (b)  The system of records identified as CFTC-10 Investigatory Records contains records compiled for law enforcement purposes, including records developed during an investigation of violations or potential violations of the CEA. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act and CFTC's rules promulgated thereunder are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.

    (4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (c)  The system of records identified as CFTC-12 National Futures Association (NFA) Applications Suite System contains records held by NFA on behalf of the Commission, by delegated authority to support the Commission's registration and other regulatory authority. These records include records pertaining to the fitness of individuals to be registered with the Commission and engage in business activities that are subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and records pertaining to disciplinary or other adverse action investigated or taken with respect to individual registrants. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of accountings of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.

    (4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (d)  The system of records identified as CFTC-31 Closed Commission Meetings contains records about individuals who are the subject of discussion at closed Commission meetings, including those who are the subject of investigations or who are being considered for employment. These records may include statements from individuals who have provided information in the course of an applicant's or employee's background investigation or other Commission investigation and who have requested that their identities remain confidential. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (5) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.

    (4) From section (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (e)  The system of records identified as CFTC-32 Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files contains records relevant to criminal and civil investigations conducted by the Office of the Inspector General, including records about individuals being investigated for fraudulent and abusive activities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1) through (3), (e)(4)(G) through (I), and (e)(5) and (8); (f); and (g), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.4; 146.5; 146.6(b), (d), and (e); 146.7(a), (c), and (d); 146.8; 146.9; 146.10; and 146.11(a)(7) through (9). In addition, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From section (c)(4) (Notice of Correction), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of section (d), as noted below.

    (3) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (4) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) and (5) (Accuracy, Timeliness, Relevance, and Completeness), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.

    (5) From section (e)(2) (Collect from Individual), because in a law enforcement investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement, in that the subject of the investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations or duties.

    (6) From section (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement), because to comply with the requirements of this section during the course of an investigation could impede the information gathering process and hamper the investigation.

    (7) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (8) From section (e)(8) (Serve Notice), because the application of this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation, present a serious impediment to law enforcement by interfering with the ability to issue subpoenas or otherwise gather information, and reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.

    (9) From section (g) (Civil Remedies), because this system of records is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act for the reasons stated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; therefore, the Commission is not subject to civil action for failure to adhere to those requirements.

    (f)  The system of records identified as CFTC-44 Personnel Clearance System contains records related to the background investigations and security clearances of individuals who have been or are being considered for access to Commission facilities, information technology systems, and classified or confidential information. These records may include statements from individuals who have provided information in the course of a background investigation and have requested that their identity remain confidential. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (5) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From sections (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity that were previously unknown to the individual. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to adequately assess an individual when making a decision about the individual's access to Commission facilities, information technology systems, and classified and confidential information.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because the records contained in this system may be related to ongoing investigations, and individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and others that were previously unknown to the individual. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Amendment of the records in this system of records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of conducting and adjudicating background investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation and provide investigative leads.

    (4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    (g)  The system of records identified as CFTC-49 Whistleblower Records contains records related to whistleblower tips, complaints and referrals, records related to investigations and inquiries into whistleblower complaints, and records related to the whistleblower award claim and determination process. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:

    (1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.

    (2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

    (3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation or aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads. (4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements) and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

    § 147.4   Procedure for announcing meetings.

#### § § 147.4

    (a) Advance notice of all meetings of the Commission shall be provided to the public.

    (b) When a majority of Commissioners determines by a recorded vote that Commission business requires a meeting be held upon public notice of less than one week as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall, except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 147.3(b), make a public announcement, at the earliest practicable time, of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting and which portions of the meeting shall be open or closed to the public, and indicate an official of the Commission who may be contacted at a designated telephone number for information about the meeting.

    (d) Public announcement of meetings, as required by this section, shall be provided as follows:

    (1) A public calendar shall be printed and distributed by the Commission on a regular basis to interested persons to provide advance public notice of meetings as required by paragraph (a) of this section, and, to the extent practicable, as required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

  PART 148—IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT IN COVERED ADJUDICATORY PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION

### Part 148

**Authority:** Authority: Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(1) and secs. 2(a)(11) and 8a(5) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 4a(j) and 12a(5), unless otherwise noted.

**Source:** Source: 46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 148.1   Purpose of these rules.

#### § § 148.1

      The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are prevailing private parties in adjudicatory proceedings before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.

> [51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]

      § 148.2   When the Act applies.

#### § § 148.2

      The Act applies to any covered adjudicatory proceeding pending before the Commission on or after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final Commission action has not been taken before that date. Awards may be sought for fees and other expenses incurred before October 1, 1981, in any such covered proceeding.

> [51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]

      § 148.3   Proceedings covered.

#### § § 148.3

      (a) The Act applies t__o__ adjudicatory proceedings conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Reparation proceedings under section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18, Commission review of exchange disciplinary and access denial actions under section 8c of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12c, and registered futures association disciplinary and membership denial actions under section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 21, are not covered by the Act. Proceedings brought to determine whether or not to grant or renew registrations pursuant to sections 8a or 17(), of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8, 12a and 21(), or contract market designations pursuant to section 6(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8 (a), are excluded, but proceedings brought to suspend or revoke registrations or contract market designations are covered if they are otherwise adjudicatory proceedings. For the Commission, the types of proceedings generally covered are adjudicatory proceedings as defined in § 10.2(b) of this chapter; part 14 proceedings, if they involve a hearing, are also covered.

      (b) The Commission's decision not to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in the proceedings on the application.

      (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

> [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986; 59 FR 5528, Feb. 7, 1994]

      § 148.4   Eligibility of applicants.

#### § § 148.4

      (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adjudicatory proceeding for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.

      (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:

      (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;

      (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more that 500 employees;

      (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;

      (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and

      (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.

      (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated.

      (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.

      (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for compensation for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. The term “employee” also embraces all the agents of an applicant, by whatever title or label they may be known, for whose acts or omissions the applicant may be held liable under the Commodity Exchange Act.  7 U.S.C. 4. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.

      (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the Presiding Officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the Presiding Officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

      (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding on behalf of one or more other persons or entitles that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

      § 148.5   Standards for awards.

#### § § 148.5

      (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Commission was substantially justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the Commission.

      (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.

> [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]

      § 148.6   Allowable fees and expenses.

#### § § 148.6

      (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.

      (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the maximum daily rate prescribed for GS-18 under section 5332 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.

      (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the Presiding Officer shall consider the following:

      (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;

      (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;

      (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

      (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adjudicatory proceeding; and

      (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.

      (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

      § 148.7   Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

#### § § 148.7

      (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.

      (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance with § 13.2 of this chapter.

      § 148.8   Awards against other agencies.

#### § § 148.8

      If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission and takes a postion that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.

    Subpart B—Information Required from Applicants

      § 148.11   Contents of application.

#### § § 148.11

      (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the adjudicatory proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Commission or other agency that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.

      (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:

      (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or

      (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).

      (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.

      (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.

      (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

> [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]

      § 148.12   Net worth exhibit.

#### § § 148.12

      (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 148.4(f) of this part) when the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Presiding Officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.

      (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the Presiding Officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding. If the Presiding Officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in part 145 of this chapter. For that purpose, the applicant shall file a copy of its motion with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Compliance Staff in the Office of the Secretariat, Washington, DC.

      § 148.13   Documentation of fees and expenses.

#### § § 148.13

      The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The Presiding Officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.

      § 148.14   When an application may be filed.

#### § § 148.14

      (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the adjudicatory proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, subject to the separate hearing procedure pursuant to § 10.63(b) of this chapter, but in no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the adjudicatory proceeding.

      (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.

      (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of

      (1) The date on which an initial decision by the Presiding Officer becomes final pursuant to § 10.84 of this chapter;

      § 148.22   Answer to application.

#### § § 148.22

      (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which an award is sought may file an answer to the application. Unless counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

      (b) If counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the Presiding Officer upon request by counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency and the applicant.

      (c) Any answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the position of counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adjudicatory proceeding, counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 148.26 of this part.

      § 148.23   Reply.

#### § § 148.23

      Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adjudicatory proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 148.26 of this part.

      § 148.24   Comments by other parties.

#### § § 148.24

      Any party to an adjudicatory proceeding other than the applicant and counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the Presiding Officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.

      § 148.25   Settlement.

#### § § 148.25

      The applicant may propose settlement of the award to the Commission before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the adjudicatory proceeding, or after the adjudicatory proceeding has been concluded, in either case in accordance with § 10.108 of this chapter. If a prevailing party offers a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.

      § 148.26   Further proceedings.

#### § § 148.26

      (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency, or on his or her own initiative, the Presiding Officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the Commission was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought. No discovery and/or evidentiary proceedings shall be permitted into the question of whether the agency's position was substantially justified.

      (b) A request that the Presiding Officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

      § 148.27   Decision.

#### § § 148.27

      The Presiding Officer shall issue an initial decision on the application in accordance with the provisions of § 10.84 of this chapter. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

      § 148.28   Appeal to the Commission.

The notice need consist only of a brief statement indicating the filing party's intent to appeal the initial decision, and shall include the date upon which the initial decision was rendered, the name of the proceeding, and the docket number of the proceeding. The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Equal Access to Justice Act.

An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.

      (c) The opposing party may, within thirty (30) days after service of the appeal brief, file an original and one copy of an answering brief, and serve one copy thereof, unless the time limit is extended by the Commission upon motion of the party and for good cause shown.

      (d) Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief shall meet the requirements of § 10.12 of this chapter as to form. The content of briefs shall satisfy the requirements of § 10.102(d) of this chapter, except that any party, with leave of the Commission, may file an informal document in lieu of a brief. No brief shall exceed thirty-five (35) pages in length without advance leave of the Commission.

      (e) On review, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider  any issues arising from the record and may base its determination thereon, or limit the issues to those presented in the statement of issues in the briefs, treating those issues not raised as waived.

#### § §§ 149.131-149.139

    § 149.140   Employment.

#### § § 149.140

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

#### § §§ 149.141-149.148

    § 149.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 149.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 149.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 149.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 149.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 149.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 149.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 149.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 149.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

#### § § 150.1

    As used in this part—

    means a transaction or position in commodity derivative contracts in a physical commodity, where:

    (1) Such transaction or position:

    (i) Represents a substitute for transactions made or to be made, or positions taken or to be taken, at a later time in a physical marketing channel;

    (ii) Is economically appropriate to the reduction of price risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise; and

    (iii) Arises from the potential change in the value of—

    (A) Assets which a person owns, produces, manufactures, processes, or merchandises or anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising;

    (B) Liabilities which a person owes or anticipates incurring; or

    (C) Services that a person provides or purchases, or anticipates providing or purchasing; or

    (2) Such transaction or position qualifies as a:

    (i)  Paired positions of a pass-through swap and a pass-through swap offset, where:

    (A) The pass-through swap is a swap position entered into by one person for which the swap would qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction or position pursuant to paragraph (1) of this definition (the bona fide hedging swap counterparty) that is opposite another person (the pass-through swap counterparty);

    (B) The pass-through swap offset:

    () Is a futures contract position, option on a futures contract position, or swap position entered into by the pass-through swap counterparty; and

    () Reduces the pass-through swap counterparty's price risks attendant to the pass-through swap; and

    (C) With respect to the pass-through swap offset, the pass-through swap counterparty receives from the bona fide hedging swap counterparty a written representation that the pass-through swap qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction or position pursuant to paragraph (1) of this definition, and the pass-through swap counterparty may rely in good faith on such written representation, unless the pass-through swap counterparty has information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation; or

    (ii)  A futures contract position, option on a futures contract position, or swap position entered into by a bona fide hedging swap counterparty that reduces price risks attendant to a previously-entered-into swap position that qualified as a bona fide hedging transaction or position at the time it was entered into for that counterparty pursuant to paragraph (1) of this definition.

    means any futures contract, option on a futures contract, or swap in a commodity (other than a security futures product as defined in section 1a(45) of the Act).

    means a futures contract that is listed in § 150.2(d).

    means, with respect to a particular referenced contract, any swap that has identical material contractual specifications, terms, and conditions to such referenced contract.

    (1) Other than as provided in paragraph (2) of this definition, for the purpose of determining whether a swap is an economically equivalent swap with respect to a particular referenced contract, the swap shall not be deemed to lack identical material contractual specifications, terms, and conditions due to different lot size specifications or notional amounts, delivery dates diverging by less than one calendar day, or different post-trade risk management arrangements.

    (2) With respect to any natural gas referenced contract, for the purpose of determining whether a swap is an economically equivalent swap to such referenced contract, the swap shall not be deemed to lack identical material contractual specifications, terms, and conditions due to different lot size specifications or notional amounts, delivery dates diverging by less than two calendar days, or different post-trade risk management arrangements.

    (3) With respect to any referenced contract or class of referenced contracts, the Commission may make a determination that any swap or class of swaps satisfies, or does not satisfy, this economically equivalent swap definition.

    (1) Which authorizes an independent account controller independently to control all trading decisions with respect to the eligible entity's client positions and accounts that the independent account controller holds directly or indirectly, or on the eligible entity's behalf, but without the eligible entity's day-to-day direction; and

    (2) Which maintains:

    (i) Only such minimum control over the independent account controller as is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities to the managed positions and accounts, and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf; or

    (B) A position that includes an option contract that exceeds speculative position limits when the applicable option contract is adjusted by an economically reasonable and analytically supported exposure to price changes of the underlying referenced contract as of that business day's close of trading, as long as the applicable option contract does not exceed such speculative position limits when evaluated using the previous business day's exposure to the underlying referenced contract. This paragraph (B) shall not apply if such day would be the last trading day of the spot month for the corresponding core referenced futures contract.

    (2) A futures contract which has been converted to an economically equivalent amount of an open position in a core referenced futures contract; and

    (3) A swap which has been converted to an economically equivalent amount of an open position in a core referenced futures contract.

Each estimate shall be accompanied by a description of the methodology used to derive the estimate and any statistical data supporting the estimate, and shall be submitted using the format and procedures approved in writing by the Commission. A designated contract market should use the guidance regarding deliverable supply in appendix C to part 38 of this chapter.

    (1) A commodity index contract, monthly average pricing contract, outright price reporting agency index contract, and/or a location basis contract shall be considered to be a referenced contract;

    (2) A bona fide hedging transaction or position recognition or spread exemption shall no longer apply; and

    (3) A swap shall be considered to be an economically equivalent swap.

    (j)  (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority in paragraph (f) of this section to request estimated spot month deliverable supply from a designated contract market and to provide the format and procedures for submitting such estimates.

    (i) Is the commodity pool operator of the pooled account;

    (ii) Is a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account, unless:

    (iii) Has, by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly, a 25 percent or greater ownership or equity interest in a commodity pool, the operator of which is exempt from registration under § 4.13 of this chapter.

    (2)  Any person with an ownership or equity interest in an owned entity of 10 percent or greater (other than an interest in a pooled account subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section), need not aggregate the accounts or positions of the owned entity with any other accounts or positions such person is required to aggregate, provided that:

    (i) Such person, including any entity that such person must aggregate, and the owned entity (to the extent that such person is aware or should be aware of the activities and practices of the aggregated entity or the owned entity):

    (A) Do not have knowledge of the trading decisions of the other;

    (B) Trade pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;

    (C) Have and enforce written procedures to preclude each from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities;

    (D) Do not share employees that control the trading decisions of either; and

    (E) Do not have risk management systems that permit the sharing of its trades or its trading strategy with employees that control the trading decisions of the other; and

    (i) A person other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;

    (ii) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account;

    (iii) Each trading decision of the discretionary account or the customer trading program is determined independently of all trading decisions in other accounts which the futures commission merchant or the affiliate holds, has a financial interest of 10 percent or more in, or controls; and

    (iv) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

    (4)  An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in § 150.1(e), except for the spot month in physical-delivery commodity contracts, provided that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 150.2.

    (i)  If the independent account controller is affiliated with the eligible entity or another independent account controller, each of the affiliated entities must:

    (A) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities to the managed positions and accounts and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;

    (B) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;

    (C) Market such trading systems separately; and

    (D) Solicit funds for such trading by separate disclosure documents that meet the standards of § 4.24 or § 4.34 of this chapter, as applicable, where such disclosure documents are required under part 4 of this chapter.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (5)  A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.

    (6)  A broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or similarly registered with a foreign regulatory authority, need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities acquired in the normal course of business as a dealer,  such person does not have actual knowledge of the trading decisions of the owned entity.

    (7)  A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation (such as, only by way of example, information reflecting the transactions and positions of a such person and the owned entity) creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder, provided that such person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation, and provided further that such person has filed a prior notice pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and included with such notice a written memorandum of law explaining in detail the basis for the conclusion that the sharing of information creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder. However, the exemption in this paragraph shall not apply where the law or regulation serves as a means to evade the aggregation of accounts or positions. All documents submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be in English, or if not, accompanied by an official English translation.

    (8)  After a person has filed a notice under paragraph (c) of this section, another person need not file a separate notice identifying any position or account identified in such notice filing, provided that:

    (i) Such other person has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that filed the notice, or the person that filed the notice has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in such other person, or an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater is held in such other person by a third person who holds an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that has filed the notice (in any such case, the ownership or equity interest may be held directly or indirectly);

    (ii) Such other person complies with the conditions applicable to the exemption specified in such notice filing, other than the filing requirements; and

    (iii) Such other person does not otherwise control trading of any account or position identified in such notice filing.

    (iv) Upon call by the Commission, any person relying on the exemption in this paragraph (b)(8) shall provide to the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.

    (c)  (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice (or earlier, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and shall include:

    (i) A description of the relevant circumstances that warrant disaggregation; and

    (ii) A statement of a senior officer of the entity certifying that the conditions set forth in the applicable aggregation exemption provision have been met.

    (2) If a person newly acquires an ownership or equity interest in an owned entity of 10 percent or greater and is eligible for the aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the person may elect that a notice filed under this paragraph (c) shall be effective as of the date of such acquisition if such notice is filed no later than 60 days after such acquisition.

    (3) Upon call by the Commission, any person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section shall provide such information demonstrating that the person meets the requirements of the exemption, as is requested by the Commission. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.

    (4) In the event of a material change to the information provided in any notice filed under this paragraph (c), an updated or amended notice shall promptly be filed detailing the material change.

    (5) Any notice filed under this paragraph (c) shall be submitted in the form and manner provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.

    (6) If a person is eligible for an aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7) of this section, a failure to timely file a notice under this paragraph (c) shall not constitute a violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any position limit set forth in § 150.2 if such notice is filed no later than five business days after the person is aware, or should be aware, that such notice has not been timely filed.

    (d)  Unless otherwise instructed by the Commission or its designees, any person submitting reports under this section shall submit the corresponding required filings and any other information required under this part to the Commission using the format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission procedures approved in writing by the Commission. Unless otherwise provided in this section, the notice shall be effective upon filing. When the reporting entity discovers errors or omissions to past reports, the entity shall so notify the Commission and file corrected information in a form and manner and at a time as may be instructed by the Commission or its designee.

    (e)  (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Enforcement, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate, the authority:

    (i) In paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section to call for additional information from a person claiming the exemption in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.

    (ii)  With respect to a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility that elects to grant exemptions under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section:

    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the designated contract market or swap execution facility shall require an entity to file an application requesting such exemption in advance of the date that such position would be in excess of the limits then in effect. Such application shall include any information needed to enable the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the Commission to determine whether the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the designated contract market or swap execution facility may grant an exemption. Any application for a bona fide hedging transaction or position shall include a description of the applicant's activity in the cash markets and swaps markets for the commodity underlying the position for which the application is submitted, including, but not limited to, information regarding the offsetting cash positions.

    (B) The designated contract market or swap execution facility may adopt rules that allow a person, due to demonstrated sudden or unforeseen increases in its bona fide hedging needs, to file an application to request a recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position within five business days after the person established the position that exceeded the applicable exchange-set speculative position limit.

    (E) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the designated contract market or swap execution facility's review nor once the designated contract market or swap execution facility has issued its determination, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the applicant brings its position within the designated contract market or swap execution facility's speculative position limits within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the designated contract market or swap execution facility.

    (F) The designated contract market or swap execution facility shall require, for any such exemption granted, that the entity re-apply for the exemption at least annually;

    (G) The designated contract market or swap execution facility:

    () May, in accordance with the designated contract market or swap execution facility's rules, deny any such application, or limit, condition, or revoke any such exemption, at any time after providing notice to the applicant, and

    () Shall consider whether the requested exemption would result in positions that would not be in accord with sound commercial practices in the relevant commodity derivative market and/or that would exceed an amount that may be established and liquidated in an orderly fashion in that market; and

    (H) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(G) of this section, the designated contract market or swap execution facility may grant exemptions, subject to terms, conditions, or limitations, that require a person to exit any referenced contract positions in excess of position limits during the lesser of the last five days of trading or the time period for the spot month in such physical-delivery contract, or to otherwise limit the size of such position during that time period. Designated contract markets and swap execution facilities may refer to paragraph (b) of appendix B or appendix G to part 150, for guidance regarding the foregoing, as applicable.

    (A) The date of disposition;

    (B) The effective date of the disposition;

    (C) The expiration date of any recognition or exemption;

    (D) Any unique identifier(s) the designated contract market or swap execution facility may assign to track the application, or the specific type of recognition or exemption;

    (K) Any size limitations or conditions established for a spread exemption or other exemption; and

    (L) For a bona fide hedging transaction or position, a concise summary of the applicant's activity in the cash markets and swaps markets for the commodity underlying the commodity derivative position for which the application was submitted.

    (i)  For any commodity derivative contract subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility shall establish speculative position limits for the spot month no greater than 25 percent of the estimated spot month deliverable supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed.

    (ii)  Alternatively, a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may submit rules to the Commission establishing spot month speculative position limits other than as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, provided that each limit is set at a level that is necessary and appropriate to reduce the potential threat of market manipulation or price distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price or index.

    (2) —(i)  For any commodity derivative contract subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility shall adopt either speculative position limits or position accountability outside of the spot month at a level that is necessary and appropriate to reduce the potential threat of market manipulation or price distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price or index.

    (ii)  A designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may refer to the non-exclusive acceptable practices in paragraph (b) of appendix F of this part to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

    (3)  For any newly listed commodity derivative contract subject to paragraph (b) of this section that is substantially the same as an existing contract listed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility, the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility listing such newly listed contract shall adopt spot month, individual month, and all-months-combined speculative position limits comparable to those of the existing contract. Alternatively, if such designated contract market or swap execution facility seeks to adopt speculative position limits that are not comparable to those of the existing contract, such designated contract market or swap execution facility shall demonstrate to the Commission how the levels comply with paragraphs (b)(1) and/or (b)(2) of this section.

    (i) An entity seeking an exemption shall be required to apply to the designated contract market or swap execution facility for any such exemption from its speculative position limit rules; and

    (ii) A designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may deny any such application, or limit, condition, or revoke any such exemption, at any time after providing notice to the applicant. Such designated contract market or swap execution facility shall consider whether the requested exemption would result in positions that would not be in accord with sound commercial practices in the relevant commodity derivative market and/or would exceed an amount that may be established and liquidated in an orderly fashion in that market.

    (c)  For security futures products, speculative position limits and position accountability requirements are specified in § 41.25 of this chapter.

    (d)  For commodity derivative contracts in a physical commodity, a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility shall have aggregation rules that conform to § 150.4.

    (e)  In order for a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility to adopt speculative position limits and/or position accountability pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and/or to elect to offer exemptions from any such levels pursuant to such paragraphs, the designated contract market or swap execution facility shall submit to the Commission pursuant to part 40 of this chapter rules establishing such levels and/or exemptions.

    (3)  Nothing in this section prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this section.

    (1)  The designated contract market or swap execution facility requires the applicant to provide, and can obtain from the applicant, all information needed to enable the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the Commission to determine whether the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the designated contract market or swap execution facility may recognize a position as a bona fide hedging transaction or position, including the following:

    (iii) A statement concerning the maximum size of all gross positions in commodity derivative contracts for which the application is submitted;

    (C) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission's review nor once a determination has been issued, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

    (iv) The maximum size of the position that may exceed Federal speculative position limits;

    (v) The effective date and expiration date of the recognition;

    (vi) An indication regarding whether the position may be maintained during the last five days of trading during the spot month, or the time period for the spot month; and

    (vii) A copy of the application and any supporting materials.

    (3)  A person may exceed Federal speculative position limits on a referenced contract after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) or (6) of this section, before the ten business day period expires.

    (4)  If a person files an application for a recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, then such person may rely on the designated contract market or swap execution facility's determination to grant such recognition for purposes of Federal speculative position limits two business days after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) or (6) of this section, before the two business day period expires.

    (5)  The Commission may stay an application that requires additional time to analyze, and/or may request additional information to determine whether the position for which the application is submitted meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Commission shall notify the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant of a Commission determination to stay the application and/or request any supplemental information, and shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond. The Commission will have an additional 45 days from the date of the stay notification to conduct the review and issue a determination with respect to the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has not yet exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may not exceed Federal speculative position limits unless the Commission approves the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has already exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may continue to maintain the position unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section.

    (6)  If, during the Commission's ten or two business day review period in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, the Commission determines that a position for which the application is submitted does not meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission shall:

    (i) Notify the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant within ten or two business days, as applicable, after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section;

    (ii) Provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond to such notification;

    (iii) Issue a determination to deny the application, or limit or condition the application approval for purposes of Federal speculative position limits and, as applicable, require the person to reduce the derivatives position within a commercially reasonable time, as determined by the Commission in consultation with the applicant and the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise come into compliance; and

    (iv) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review nor once the Commission has issued its determination, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with any requirement to reduce the position pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section, as applicable.

    (f)  (1) If a designated contract market or a swap execution facility limits, conditions, or revokes any recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of the respective designated contract market's or swap execution facility's speculative position limits established under § 150.5(a), then such recognition will also be deemed limited, conditioned, or revoked for purposes of Federal speculative position limits.

    (2) If the Commission determines, at any time, that a position that has been recognized as a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of Federal speculative position limits is no longer consistent with section 4a(c)(2) of the Act or the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in § 150.1, the following applies:

    (i) The Commission shall notify the person holding the position and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility. After providing such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility an opportunity to respond, the Commission may, in its discretion, limit, condition, or revoke its determination for purposes of Federal speculative position limits and require the person to reduce the derivatives position within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise come into compliance;

    (ii) The Commission shall include in its notification a brief explanation of the nature of the issues raised and the specific provisions of the Act or the Commission's regulations with which the position or application is, or appears to be, inconsistent; and

    (iii) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review, nor once the Commission has issued its determination, provided the person submitted the application in good faith and reduces the position within a commercially reasonable time, as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise comes into compliance.

    (g) —(1)  The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority to request additional information, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, from the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility and applicant.

    (2)  The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this section.

    (3)  Nothing in this section prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this section.

      (iii)  You do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if:

      (A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or

      (B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.

      (iv)  You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for the consumer.

      (b)  You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form, as the initial notice you provide in accordance with § 160.4.

      (c)  If you provide the opt out notice after the initial notice in accordance with § 160.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing, or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

      (d)  (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice; however, you must honor a request from one or more joint account holders for a separate opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer.

      (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either:

      (i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or

      (ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.

      (3) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.

      (4) You may not require all joint consumers to opt out before you implement any opt out direction.

      (i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary;

      (ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction; or

      (A) You must permit John and Mary to opt out for each other.

      (B) If both opt out, you must permit both to notify you in a single response (such as on a form or through a telephone call).

      (C) If John opts out and Mary does not, you may only disclose nonpublic personal information about Mary, but not about John, and not about John and Mary jointly.

      (e)  You must comply with a consumer's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it.

      (f)  A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.

      (g)  (1) A consumer's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing, either by hard copy or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

      (2) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship.

      (h)  When you are required by this section to deliver an opt out notice, you must deliver it according to § 160.9.

      (i)  Pursuant to § 160.2(a) of this part, a model privacy form that meets the notice content requirements of this section is included in appendix A of this part.

    Subpart A—Business Affiliate Marketing Rules

      § 162.3   Affiliate marketing opt out and exceptions.

#### § § 162.3

      (a)  A covered affiliate may not use eligibility information about a consumer that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate with the consumer to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to such consumer unless—

      (1) It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in writing or if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice that the person may use shared eligibility information about that consumer received from an affiliate to make solicitations for marketing purposes to such consumer;

      (2) The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out, or prohibit the covered affiliate from using eligibility information to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the consumer; and

      (3) The consumer has not opted out.

      (b)  The notice required by this section must be provided:

      (1) By an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer; or

      (2) As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the affiliates on the joint notice has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.

      (c)  These proposed regulations would not apply to the following covered affiliate:

      (1) A covered affiliate that has a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer;

      (2) Communications between an employer and employee-consumer (or his or her beneficiary) in connection with an employee benefit plan;

      (3) A covered affiliate that is currently providing services to the consumer;

      (4) If the consumer initiated the communication with the covered affiliate by oral, electronic, or written means;

      (5) If the consumer authorized or requested the covered affiliate's solicitation; or

      (6) If compliance by a person with these regulations would prevent that person's compliance with state insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination.

      (d) —(1)  A covered affiliate makes a solicitation for marketing purposes if the person—

      (i) Receives eligibility information from an affiliate;

      (ii) Uses that eligibility information to do one or more of the following:

      (A) Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a solicitation;

      (B) Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a solicitation about the covered affiliate's financial products or services; or

      (C) Decide which of the services or contracts to market to the consumer or tailor the solicitation to that consumer; and

      (iii) As a result of the covered affiliate's use of the eligibility information, the consumer is provided a solicitation.

      (3)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, a covered affiliate receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information if a service provider acting on the covered affiliate's behalf (regardless of whether such service provider is a third party or an affiliate of the covered affiliate) receives or uses that information in the manner described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a service provider is acting on behalf of a covered affiliate when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing the covered affiliate's financial products or services.

      (4)  Unless a covered affiliate uses eligibility information that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart:

      (ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or previously had with the consumer to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, and the covered affiliate does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding that use.

      (5) —(i)  A covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that the covered affiliate may access) receives eligibility information from an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, so long as—

      (A) The affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services);

      (B) The affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use such affiliate's eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose financial products or services may be marketed to the consumer by the service provider, the types of financial products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;

      (C) The affiliate requires the service provider to implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses such affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with the terms and conditions established by such affiliate relating to the marketing of the covered affiliate's financial products or services;

      (D) The affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and

      (E) The covered affiliate does not directly use its affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (ii)  (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and the service provider; and

      (B) The specific terms and conditions established by the affiliate as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.

      (e)  Nothing in this rulemaking will limit the responsibility of a covered affiliate to comply with the notice and opt-out provisions under other privacy rules under the FCRA, the GLB Act or the CEA.

      § 162.4   Scope and duration of opt out.

#### § § 162.4

      (a) —(1)  The consumer's election to opt out prohibits any covered affiliate subject to the scope of the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer.

      (2) —(i)  If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with—

      (A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with a covered affiliate or its affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or

      (B) Any other transaction between the consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliates as described in the notice.

      (ii)  A consumer has a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:

      (A) The covered affiliate is a futures commission merchant through whom a consumer has opened an account, or that carries the consumer's account on a fully-disclosed basis, or that effects or engages in commodity interest transactions with or for a consumer, even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer;

      (B) The covered affiliate is an introducing broker that solicits or accepts specific orders for trades;

      (C) The covered affiliate is a commodity trading advisor with whom a consumer has a contract or subscription, either written or oral, regardless of whether the advice is standardized, or is based on, or tailored to, the commodity interest or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics of the particular consumer;

      (D) The covered affiliate is a commodity pool operator, and accepts or receives from the consumer, funds, securities, or property for the purpose of purchasing an interest in a commodity pool;

      (E) The covered affiliate is a major swap participant that holds securities or other assets as collateral for a loan made to the consumer, even if the covered affiliate did not make the loan or do not affect any transactions on behalf of the consumer; or

      (F) The covered affiliate is a swap dealer that regularly effects or engages in swap transactions with or for a consumer even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer.

      (3) —(i)  If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliate, and the covered affiliate or its affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.

      (ii)  A consumer does not have a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:

      (A) The covered affiliate has acted solely as a “finder” for a futures commission merchant, and the covered affiliate does not solicit or accept specific orders for trades; or

      (B) The covered affiliate has solicited the consumer to participate in a pool or to direct his or her account and he or she has not provided the covered affiliate with funds to participate in a pool or entered into any agreement with the covered affiliate to direct his or her account.

      (4)  A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.

      (5)  A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.

      (b)  An opt-out election must be effective for a period of at least five years beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out election in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out election may be established for a period of more than five years or for an indefinite period unless revoked.

      (c)  A consumer may opt out at any time.

      (d)  An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.

      § 162.5   Contents of opt-out notice; consolidated and equivalent notices.

#### § § 162.5

      (a) —(1)  An opt-out notice must be in writing, be clear and conspicuous, as well as concise, and must accurately disclose the following:

      (i) (A) The name of the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer, which is providing the notice; or

      (B) If jointly provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, then the notice may indicate that it is being provided by multiple companies with the same name or multiple companies in the same group or family of companies. If the affiliates providing the notice do not share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates;

      (ii) The list of affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer;

      (iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;

      (iv) A statement that the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer;

      (v) A statement that the consumer's election will apply for the specified period of time and, if applicable, that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;

      (vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who have previously elected to opt out, that such consumer does not need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and

      (vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.

      (2)  If consumer is granted an opt-out period longer than a five-year duration, the opt-out notice must specify the length of the opt-out period.

      (3)  The duration of an opt-out period may be increased for a period longer than the period specified in the opt-out notice without having to provide a revised notice of the increase to the consumer.

      (b)  (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided to joint consumers.

      (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out on behalf of each joint consumer.

      (3) The opt-out election notice must explain how an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated. That is, the notice should specify whether an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or as applying to each joint consumer separately.

      (4) If the opt-out election notice provides that each joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the joint consumer must be permitted to exercise his or her separate rights to opt out in a single response.

      (5) A covered affiliate cannot require all joint consumers to opt out before implementing any opt-out election.

      (c)  If the consumer is afforded a broader right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.

      (d)  A notice required by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the covered affiliate providing the notice, including but not limited to notices in the FCRA or the GLB Act privacy notices.

      (e)  A notice or disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by this part in terms of content, and that is provided to a consumer together with a notice required by any other provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.

      (f)  Model notices are provided in appendix A of this part. These notices were meant to facilitate compliance with this subpart; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be interpreted to require persons subject to this part to use the model notices.

      § 162.6   Reasonable opportunity to opt out.

#### § § 162.6

      (a)  A covered affiliate must not use eligibility information about a consumer that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate to make a solicitation to such consumer about the covered affiliate's financial products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by this subpart.

      (b)  A reasonable opportunity to opt out under this subpart is:

      (1) If the opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to opt out.

      (2) If the opt-out notice is sent  electronic means to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.

      (3) If the opt-out notice is sent  e-mail (where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail), the consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.

      (4) If the opt-out notice provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction.

      (5) If the opt-out notice is provided during an in-person transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of completing the transaction, whether to opt out through a simple process.

      (6) If the opt-out notice is provided in conjunction with other privacy notices required by law, the consumer is allowed to exercise the opt-out election within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt out under that privacy notice.

      § 162.7   Reasonable and simple methods of opting out.

#### § § 162.7

      (a)  A covered affiliate shall be prohibited from using eligibility information about a consumer received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer about the covered affiliate's financial products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable and simple method to opt out, as required by this subpart.

      (b)  Reasonable and simple methods of opting out include:

      (1) Designating a check-off box in a prominent position on an opt-out election form;

      (2) Including a reply form and a self-addressed envelope (in a mailing);

      (3) Providing an electronic means, if the consumer agrees, that can be electronically mailed or processed through an Internet Web site;

      (4) Providing a toll-free telephone number; or

      (5) Exercising an opt-out election through whatever means are acceptable under a consolidated privacy notice required under other laws.

      (c)  Each consumer may be required to opt out through a specific method, as long as that method is acceptable under this subpart.

      § 162.8   Acceptable delivery methods of opt-out notices.

#### § § 162.8

      (a)  The opt-out notice must be provided so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice.

      (b)  For opt-out notices provided electronically, the notice may be provided in compliance with either the electronic disclosure provisions in § 1.4 of this title or the provisions in section 101 of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001

      § 162.9   Renewal of opt out.

#### § § 162.9

      (a) —(1)  Since the FCRA provides that opt-out elections can expire in a period of no less than five years, an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer must provide a renewal notice to the consumer after such time in order to allow its affiliates to make solicitations. After the opt-out election period expires, its affiliates may make solicitations unless:

      (i) The consumer has been given a renewal notice that complies with the requirements of this section and §§ 162.6 through 162.8 of this subpart, and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to renew the opt-out election, and the consumer does not renew the opt out; or

      (ii) An exception in Sec. 162.3(c) of this subpart applies.

      (2)  Each opt-out renewal must be effective for a period of at least five years as provided in § 162.4(b) of this subpart.

      (3)  The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:

      (i) By the affiliate that provided the previous opt-out notice, or its successor; or

      (ii) As part of a joint renewal notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, or their successors, that jointly provided the previous opt-out notice.

      (b)  The contents of the renewal notice must include all of the same contents of the initial notices, but also must include:

      (1) A statement that the consumer previously elected to limit the use of certain information to make solicitations to the consumer;

      (2) A statement that the consumer may elect to renew the consumer's previous election; and

      (3) If applicable, a statement that the consumer's election to renew will apply for a specified period of time stated in the notice and that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires.

      (c)  Renewal notices must be provided in a reasonable period of time before the expiration of the opt-out election period or any time after the expiration of the opt-out period, but before solicitations that would have been prohibited by the expired opt-out election are made to the consumer.

      (d)  An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before the expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt-out election.

      (1) Ensure the security and confidentiality of consumer information;

      (2) Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of consumer information; and

      (b)  Any covered affiliate under this part who maintains or otherwise possesses consumer information for a business purpose must properly dispose of such information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal.

      (c)  The following examples are “reasonable” disposal measures for the purposes of this subpart—

      (1) Implementing and monitoring compliance with policies and procedures that require the burning, pulverizing, or shredding of papers containing consumer information so that the information cannot practicably be read or reconstructed;

      (2) Implementing and monitoring compliance with policies and procedures that require the destruction or erasure of electronic media containing consumer information so that the information cannot practically be read or reconstructed; and

      (3) After due diligence, entering into and monitoring compliance with a written contract with another party engaged in the business of record destruction to dispose of consumer information in a manner that is consistent with this rule.

      (d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed:

      (1) To require a person to maintain or destroy any record pertaining to a consumer that is imposed under Sec. 1.31 or any other provision of law; or

      (2) To alter or affect any requirement imposed under any other provision of law to maintain or destroy such a record.

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 53200, Aug. 25, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

    § 165.1   General.

#### § § 165.1

    Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, entitled “Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protection,” requires the Commission to pay awards, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. This part 165 describes the whistleblower program that the Commission intends to establish to implement the provisions of Section 23, and explains the procedures the whistleblower will need to follow in order to be eligible for an award. Whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully, because the failure to take certain required steps within the time frames described in this part may result in disqualification from receiving an award. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind the Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount thereof.

    § 165.2   Definitions.

#### § § 165.2

    As used in this part:

    (a)  The term “action” generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

    (1) For purposes of making an award under § 165.7, the Commission will treat as a Commission action two or more administrative or judicial proceedings brought by the Commission if these proceedings arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts; or

    (2) For purposes of determining the payment on an award under § 165.14, the Commission will deem as part of the Commission action upon which the award was based any subsequent Commission proceeding that, individually, results in a monetary sanction of $1,000,000 or less, and that arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts.

    (b)  The phrase “aggregate amount” means the total amount of an award granted to one or more whistleblowers pursuant to § 165.8.

    (c)  The term “analysis” means the whistleblower's examination and evaluation of information that may be generally available, but which reveals information that is not generally known or available to the public.

    (d)  The phrase “collected by the Commission” refers to any funds received, and confirmed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in satisfaction of part or all of a civil monetary penalty, disgorgement obligation, or fine owed to the Commission.

    (e)  The phrase “covered judicial or administrative action” means any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act whose successful resolution results in monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000.

    (f)  The term “Fund” means the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Customer Protection _Fund._

    (g)  The phrase “independent knowledge” means factual information in the whistleblower's possession that is not generally known or available to the public. The whistleblower may gain independent knowledge from the whistleblower's experiences, communications and observations in the whistleblower's personal business or social interactions. The Commission will not consider the whistleblower's information to be derived from the whistleblower's independent knowledge if the whistleblower obtained the information:

    (1) From sources generally available to the public such as corporate filings and the media, including the Internet;

    (2) Through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless the disclosure is otherwise permitted by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;

    (3) In connection with the legal representation of a client on whose behalf the whistleblower, or the whistleblower's employer or firm, have been providing services, and the whistleblower seek to use the information to make a whistleblower submission for the whistleblower's own benefit, unless disclosure is authorized by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;

    (4) Because the whistleblower was an officer, director, trustee, or partner of an entity and another person informed the whistleblower of allegations of misconduct, or the whistleblower learned the information in connection with the entity's processes for identifying, reporting, and addressing possible violations of law;

    (5) Because the whistleblower was an employee whose principal duties involved compliance or internal audit responsibilities; or

    (6) By a means or in a manner that is determined by a United States court to violate applicable Federal or state criminal law.

    (7)  Paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section shall not apply if:

    (i) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure of the information to the Commission is necessary to prevent the relevant entity from engaging in conduct that is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the entity or investors;

    (ii) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that the relevant entity is engaging in conduct that will impede an investigation of the misconduct; or

    (iii) At least 120 days have elapsed since the whistleblower provided the information to the relevant entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor, or since the whistleblower received the information, if the whistleblower received it under circumstances indicating that the entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor was already aware of the information.

    (h)  The phrase “independent analysis” means the whistleblower's own analysis, whether done alone or in combination with others.

    (i)  The Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information that led to the successful enforcement of a judicial or administrative action, or related action, in the following circumstances:

    (1) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information that was sufficiently specific, credible, and timely to cause the Commission staff to commence an examination, open an investigation, reopen an investigation that the Commission had closed, or to inquire concerning different conduct as part of a current examination or investigation, and the Commission brought a successful judicial or administrative action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the subject of the whistleblower's original information; or

    (2) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information about conduct that was already under examination or investigation by the Commission, the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), foreign futures authority, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (except in cases where the whistleblower was an original source of this information as defined in paragraph (l) of this section), and the whistleblower's submission significantly contributed to the success of the action.

    (3) The whistleblower reported original information through an entity's internal whistleblower, legal, or compliance procedures for reporting allegations of possible violations of law before or at the same time the whistleblower reported them to the Commission; the entity later provided the whistleblower's information to the Commission, or provided results of an audit or investigation initiated in whole or in part in response to information the whistleblower reported to the entity; and the information the entity provided to the Commission satisfies either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section. Under this paragraph (i)(3), the whistleblower must also submit the same information to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 165.3 within 180 days of providing it to the entity.

    (j)  The phrase “monetary sanctions,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action, or related action, means—

    (1) Any monies, including penalties, disgorgement, restitution, and interest ordered to be paid; and

    (2) Any monies deposited into a disgorgement fund or other fund pursuant to section 308(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7246(b)) as a result of such action or any settlement of such action.

    (k)  The phrase “original information” means information that—

    (1) Is derived from the independent knowledge or independent analysis of a whistleblower;

    (2) Is not already known to the Commission from any other source, unless the whistleblower is the original source of the information;

    (3) Is not exclusively derived from an allegation made in a judicial or administrative hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the whistleblower is a source of the information; and

    (4) Is submitted to the Commission for the first time after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010).

    (5) Original information shall not lose its status as original information solely because the whistleblower submitted such information prior to October 24, 2011, provided such information was submitted after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. In order to be eligible for an award, a whistleblower who submits original information to the Commission after July 21, 2010, but prior to October 24, 2011, must comply with the procedure set forth in § 165.3(d).

    (l)  The whistleblower must satisfy the whistleblower's status as the original source of information to the Commission's satisfaction.

    (1)  The Commission will consider the whistleblower to be an “original source” of the same information that the Commission obtains from another source if the information the whistleblower provide satisfies the definition of original information and the other source obtained the information from the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative.

    (i) In order to be considered an original source of information that the Commission receives from Congress, any other federal, state or local authority, a foreign futures authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or any self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), the whistleblower must have voluntarily given such authorities the information within the meaning of this part. In determining whether the whistleblower is the original source of information, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from one of the other entities or authorities described in this paragraph (l)(1)(i).

    (ii) In the event that the whistleblower claims to be the original source of information that an authority or another entity, other than as set forth in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, provided to the Commission, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from such authority or other entity.

    (2)  If the whistleblower provides information to Congress, any other federal, state, or local authority, a foreign futures authority, a registered entity, a registered futures association, a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or to any of the persons described in paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section, and the whistleblower, within 180 days, makes a submission to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3, as the whistleblower must do in order for the whistleblower to be eligible to be considered for an award, then, for purposes of evaluating the whistleblower's claim to an award under § 165.7, the Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information as of the date of the whistleblower's original disclosure, report, or submission to one of these other authorities or persons. The whistleblower must establish the whistleblower's status as the original source of such information, as well as the effective date of any prior disclosure, report, or submission, to the Commission's satisfaction. The Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from the other authority or person in making this determination.

    (3)  If the Commission already knows some information about a matter from other sources at the time the whistleblower makes the whistleblower's submission, and the whistleblower is not an original source of that information, as described above, the Commission will consider the whistleblower an “original source” of any information the whistleblower separately provides that is original information that materially adds to the information that the Commission already possesses.

    (m)  The phrase “related action,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, means any judicial or administrative action brought by an entity listed in § 165.11(a) that is based upon the original information voluntarily submitted by a whistleblower to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3 that led to the successful resolution of the Commission action.

    (n)  The phrase “successful resolution,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, includes any settlement of such action or final judgment in favor of the Commission. It shall also have the same meaning as “successful enforcement.”

    (o)  (1) The phrase “voluntary submission” or “voluntarily submitted” within the context of submission of original information to the Commission under this part, shall mean the provision of information made prior to any request from the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)) to the whistleblower or anyone representing the whistleblower (such as an attorney) about a matter to which the information in the whistleblower's submission is relevant. If the Commission or any of these other authorities makes a request, inquiry, or demand to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative first, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary, and the whistleblower will not be eligible for an award, even if the whistleblower's response is not compelled by subpoena or other applicable law. For purposes of this paragraph (o), the whistleblower will be considered to have received a request, inquiry or demand if documents or information from the whistleblower is within the scope of a request, inquiry, or demand that the whistleblower's employer receives, unless, after receiving the documents or information from the whistleblower, the whistleblower's employer fails to provide the whistleblower's documents or information to the requesting authority in a timely manner.

    (2) In addition, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary if the whistleblower is under a pre-existing legal or contractual duty to report the violations that are the subject of the whistleblower's original information to the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or a duty that arises out of a judicial or administrative order.

    (p)  (1) The term “whistleblower” or “whistleblowers” means any individual, or two (2) or more individuals acting jointly, who provides information relating to a potential violation of the Commodity Exchange Act to the Commission, in the manner established by § 165.3. A company or another entity is not eligible to be a whistleblower.

    (2)  The anti-retaliation protections under Section 23(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act apply whether or not the whistleblower satisfies the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for an award. For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections afforded by Section 23(h)(1)(A)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the whistleblower is a whistleblower if:

    (i) The whistleblower possess a reasonable belief that the information the whistleblower is providing relates to a possible violation of the CEA, or the rules or regulations thereunder, that has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur; and

    (ii) The whistleblower provides that information in a manner described in § 165.3.

    § 165.7   Procedures for award applications in Commission actions and related actions, and Commission award determinations.

#### § § 165.7

    (a) Whenever a Commission judicial or administrative action results in monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000 ( a covered judicial or administrative action) the Commission will publish on the Commission's Web site a “Notice of Covered Action.” Such Notice of Covered Action will be published subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order that alone, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the Commission covered administrative or judicial action, exceeds $1,000,000 in monetary sanctions. The Commission will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the Commission Web site for such Notices. A whistleblower claimant will have 90 days from the date of the Notice of Covered Action to file a claim for an award based on that action, or the claim will be barred.

    (b)(1) To file a claim for a whistleblower award, the whistleblower must file Form WB-APP, Application for Award for Original Information Provided Pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act. The whistleblower must sign this form as the claimant and submit it by mail or fax to the Whistleblower Office at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters, Fax (202) 418-5975, or by completing and submitting the Form WB-APP online and submitting it electronically through the Commission's Web site at  or the Commission's Whistleblower Program Web site at

    (2) The Form WB-APP, including any attachments, must be received by the Commission within 90 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action or 90 calendar days following the date of a final judgment in a Related Action (or if the final judgment in a Related Action was issued prior to the action meeting the definition of Related Action, within 90 calendar days following the date the action satisfied the definition of Related Action, except in the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). One Form WB-APP may be filed in response to both a Notice of Covered Action and final judgment in a Related Action if the relevant time periods are applicable.

    (3) If a covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action have different final judgment dates or if there is no covered judicial or administrative action connected to a Related Action, a claimant, who wishes to file a claim for an award in both a covered judicial or administrative action and a Related Action, or in a Related Action that does not have a connected covered judicial or administrative action, must follow one of the following procedures depending on that claimant's particular situation.

    (i) If a final judgment imposing monetary sanctions in a Related Action has not been entered at the time the claimant submits a claim for an award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action, the claimant must submit the claim for the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action.

    (ii) If a final judgment in a Related Action has been entered and a Notice of Covered Action for a related covered judicial or administrative action has not been published, a claimant for an award in both the covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action may submit the claims for both the Related Action and the covered judicial or administrative action within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action. The claims may be submitted on the same Form WB-APP.

    (iii) If there is a final judgment in a Related Action that relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there is no Notice of Covered Action, a claimant for an award in connection with the Related Action must submit the claim in connection with the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following either:

    (A) The date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or

    (B) The date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action,  the date the Related Action becomes a Related Action, if the date of issuance of the final judgment in the Related Action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.

    (c) If the whistleblower provided the whistleblower's original information to the Commission anonymously pursuant to §§ 165.3 and 165.4 and:

    (1) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on a disclosed basis, the whistleblower must disclose the whistleblower's identity on the Form WB-APP. The whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award; or

    (2) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on an anonymous basis, the whistleblower must be represented by counsel. The whistleblower must provide the whistleblower's counsel with a completed Form WB-APP that is signed by the whistleblower by no later than the date upon which the whistleblower's counsel submits to the Commission a copy of the Form WB-APP that does not disclose the whistleblower's identity and is signed solely by the whistleblower's counsel. In addition, the whistleblower's counsel must retain the signed original of the whistleblower's Form WB-APP in counsel's records. Upon request of the Commission staff, whistleblower's counsel must produce to the Commission the whistleblower's signed original WB-APP and the whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award.

    (d) A claimant may withdraw a Form WB-APP by submitting a written request to the Whistleblower Office at any time during the review process.

    (e)(1) The Whistleblower Office may issue a Proposed Final Disposition for award applications that do not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR without presentation of the award claim to the staff designated by the Director of the Division of Enforcement under § 165.15(a)(2) (“Claims Review Staff”). In such instances, the Whistleblower Office will inform the award claimant in writing that the claim does not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR and will be rejected unless the claimant provides additional information. The claimant will have 30 days from the date of the written notice to respond and to correct the identified deficiencies. If the claimant does not respond in 30 days or if the response does not include information showing that the WB-APP relates to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR the Whistleblower Office will issue a Proposed Final Disposition. The claimant's failure to submit a timely response to the written notice from the Whistleblower Office will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.

    (2) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Claims Review Staff of any Proposed Final Disposition under this paragraph (e). Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any member of the Claims Review Staff may request that the Proposed Final Disposition be reviewed by the Claims Review Staff. If no member of the Claims Review Staff requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Disposition will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event that a member of the Claims Review Staff requests a review, the Claims Review Staff will review the record that the Whistleblower Office relied upon in making its determination and either remand to the Whistleblower Office for further action or issue a Final Order of the Commission, which could consist of the Proposed Final Disposition.

    (f)(1) In connection with each individual covered judicial or administrative action or final judgment in a Related Action, for which an award application is submitted, once the time for filing any appeals of the covered judicial or administrative action or the final judgment in the Related Action has expired (or, where an appeal is filed of the covered judicial or administrative action, or the final judgment in a Related Action, as applicable, and concluded), the Claims Review Staff designated under § 165.15(a)(2) will evaluate all timely whistleblower award claims submitted on Form WB-APP in response to a Notice of Covered Action, referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, or final judgment in a Related Action in accordance with the criteria set forth in this part.

    (2) The Whistleblower Office may require that the claimant provide additional information relating to the claimant's eligibility for an award or satisfaction of any of the conditions for an award, as set forth in § 165.5(b)(2). The Whistleblower Office may also request additional information from the claimant in connection with the claim for an award in a Related Action to demonstrate that the claimant directly (or through the Commission) voluntarily provided the governmental agency, regulatory authority or self-regulatory organization the original information that led to the Commission's successful covered action, and that the information provided by the claimant led to the successful enforcement of the Related Action. The Whistleblower Office may also, in its discretion, seek assistance and confirmation from the other agency in making this determination.

    (g)(1) Following Claims Review Staff evaluation, the Claims Review Staff will issue a Preliminary Determination setting forth a preliminary assessment as to whether the claim should be granted or denied and, if granted, setting forth the proposed award percentage amount. The Whistleblower Office will send a copy of the Preliminary Determination to the claimant.

    (2) The claimant may contest the Preliminary Determination made by the Claims Review Staff by submitting a written response to the Whistleblower Office setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award. The response must be in the form and manner that the Whistleblower Office shall require. The claimant may also include documentation or other evidentiary support for the grounds advanced in the claimant's response. The claimant may also request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within the timeframes provided in this paragraph (g), however such meetings are not required, and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion deny the request.

    (i) Before determining whether to contest a Preliminary Determination, the claimant may, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, request that the Whistleblower Office make available for the claimant's review the materials from among those set forth in § 165.10 that formed the basis of the Claims Review Staff's Preliminary Determination.

    (ii) If the claimant decides to contest the Preliminary Determination, the claimant must submit the claimant's written response and supporting materials setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, or if a request to review materials used to make a Preliminary Determination is made pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, then within sixty (60) calendar days of the Whistleblower Office making those materials available for the claimant's review. The claimant also may request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within those same sixty (60) calendar days. However, such meetings are not required and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion decline the request.

    (h) If the claimant fails to submit a timely response pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, then the Preliminary Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission (except where the Preliminary Determination recommended an award, in which case the Preliminary Determination will be deemed a Proposed Final Determination for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section). The claimant's failure to submit a timely response contesting a Preliminary Determination will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.

    (i) If the claimant submits a timely response under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Claims Review Staff will consider the issues and grounds advanced in the claimant's response, along with any supporting documentation the claimant provided, and will make its Proposed Final Determination.

    (j) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Commission of each Proposed Final Determination. Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any Commissioner may request that the Proposed Final Determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event a Commissioner requests a review, the Commission will review the record that the staff relied upon in making its determinations, including the claimant's submissions to the Whistleblower Office, and issue its Final Order.

    (k) A Preliminary Determination, Proposed Final Disposition, or a Proposed Final Determination may be issued only after a review for legal sufficiency by the Office of the General Counsel.

    (l) The Office of the Secretariat will serve the claimant with the Final Order of the Commission.

    § 165.8   Amount of award.

#### § § 165.8

    If all of the conditions are met for a whistleblower award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action or a related action, the Commission will then decide the amount of the award pursuant to the procedure set forth in § 165.7.

    (a) Whistleblower awards shall be in an aggregate amount equal to—

    (1) Not less than 10 percent, in total, of what has been collected of the monetary sanctions imposed in the covered judicial or administrative action or related actions; and

    (2) Not more than 30 percent, in total, of what has been collected of the monetary sanctions imposed in the covered judicial or administrative action or related actions.

    (b) If the Commission makes awards to more than one whistleblower in connection with the same action or related action, the Commission will determine an individual percentage award for each whistleblower, but in no event will the total amount awarded to all whistleblowers as a group be less than 10 percent or greater than 30 percent of the amount the Commission or the other authorities collect.

    § 165.9   Criteria for determining amount of award.

#### § § 165.9

    The determination of the amount of an award shall be in the discretion of the Commission. This discretion shall be exercised as prescribed by § 165.7.

    (a) In determining the amount of an award, the Commission shall take into consideration—

    (1) The significance of the information provided by the whistleblower to the success of the covered judicial or administrative action or related action;

    (2) The degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in a covered judicial or administrative action or related action;

    (3) The programmatic interest of the Commission in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws;

    (4) Whether the award otherwise enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and

    (5) Potential adverse incentives from oversize awards.

    (b)  In determining whether to increase the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.

    (1)  The Commission will assess the significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) The nature of the information provided by the whistleblower and how it related to the successful enforcement action, including whether the reliability and completeness of the information provided to the Commission by the whistleblower resulted in the conservation of Commission resources; and

    (ii) The degree to which the information provided by the whistleblower supported one or more successful claims brought in the Commission action or related action.

    (2)  The Commission will assess the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) Whether the whistleblower provided ongoing, extensive, and timely cooperation and assistance by, for example, helping to explain complex transactions, interpreting key evidence, or identifying new and productive lines of inquiry;

    (ii) The timeliness of the whistleblower's initial report to the Commission or to an internal compliance or reporting system of business organizations committing, or impacted by, the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, where appropriate;

    (iii) The resources conserved as a result of the whistleblower's assistance;

    (iv) Whether the whistleblower appropriately encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff of the Commission who might otherwise not have participated in the investigation or related action;

    (v) The efforts undertaken by the whistleblower to remediate the harm caused by the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, including assisting the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and

    (vi) Any unique hardships experienced by the whistleblower as a result of his or her reporting and assisting in the enforcement action.

    (3)  The Commission will assess its programmatic interest in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) The degree to which an award enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the commodity laws;

    (ii) The degree to which an award encourages the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers by appropriately rewarding whistleblower submissions of significant information and assistance, even in cases where the monetary sanctions available for collection are limited or potential monetary sanctions were reduced or eliminated by the Commission because an entity self-reported a commodities violation following the whistleblower's related internal disclosure, report, or submission;

    (iii) Whether the subject matter of the action is a Commission priority, whether the reported misconduct involves regulated entities or fiduciaries, whether the whistleblower exposed an industry-wide practice, the type and severity of the commodity violations, the age and duration of misconduct, the number of violations, and the isolated, repetitive, or ongoing nature of the violations;

    (iv) The dangers to market participants or others presented by the underlying violations involved in the enforcement action, including the amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations, the type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations, and the number of individuals or entities harmed; and

    (v) The degree, reliability and effectiveness of the whistleblower's assistance, including the consideration of the whistleblower's complete, timely truthful assistance to the Commission and criminal authorities.

    (4)  The Commission will assess whether, and the extent to which, the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower participated in internal compliance systems. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower reported the possible Commodity Exchange Act violations through internal whistleblower, legal or compliance procedures before, or at the same time as, reporting them to the Commission; and

    (ii) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower assisted any internal investigation or inquiry concerning the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.

    (c)  In determining whether to decrease the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.

    (1)  The Commission will assess the culpability or involvement of the whistleblower in matters associated with the Commission's action or related actions. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) The whistleblower's role in the Commodity Exchange Act violations;

    (ii) The whistleblower's education, training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;

    (iii) Whether the whistleblower acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the violations;

    (iv) Whether the whistleblower financially benefitted from the violations;

    (v) Whether the whistleblower is a recidivist;

    (vi) The egregiousness of any wrongdoing committed by the whistleblower; and

    (vii) Whether the whistleblower knowingly interfered with the Commission's investigation of the violations or related enforcement actions.

    (2)  The Commission will assess whether the whistleblower unreasonably delayed reporting the Commodity Exchange Act violations. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:

    (i) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but failed to take reasonable steps to report or prevent the violations from occurring or continuing;

    (ii) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but only reported them after learning about a related inquiry, investigation, or enforcement action; and

    (iii) Whether there was a legitimate reason for the whistleblower to delay reporting the violations.

    (3)  The Commission will assess, in cases where the whistleblower interacted with his or her entity's internal compliance or reporting system, whether the whistleblower undermined the integrity of such system. In considering this factor, the Commission will take into account whether there is evidence provided to the Commission that the whistleblower knowingly:

    (i) Interfered with an entity's established legal, compliance, or audit procedures to prevent or delay detection of the reported Commodity Exchange Act violation;

    (ii) Made any material false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations; or

    (iii) Provided any false writing or document knowing the writing or document contained any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or entries that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.

    (d) The Commission shall not take into consideration the balance of the Fund in determining the amount of an award.

    (iv) A State criminal or appropriate civil agency, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; or

    (v) A foreign futures authority; and

    (2) The “Related Action” is based on the original information that the whistleblower voluntarily submitted to the Commission and led to a successful resolution of the Commission judicial or administrative action.

    (b) The Commission will not make an award to a claimant for a final judgment in a Related Action if the claimant has already been granted an award by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for that same action pursuant to its whistleblower award program under section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a ). If the SEC has previously denied an award to the claimant for a judgment in a Related Action, the whistleblower will be precluded from relitigating any issues before the Commission that the SEC resolved against the claimant as part of the award denial.

    (b) Payment of a whistleblower award for a monetary sanction collected in a Commission action or related action shall be made within a reasonable time following the later of:

    (1) The date on which the monetary sanction is collected; or

    (2) The completion of the appeals process for all whistleblower award claims arising from:

    (i) The Notice of Covered Action, in the case of any payment of an award for a monetary sanction collected in a covered judicial or administrative action; or

    § 165.16   No immunity.

#### § § 165.16

    The Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protections provisions set forth in Section 23(h) of Commodity Exchange Act and this part 165 do not provide individuals who provide information to the Commission with immunity from prosecution. The fact that an individual may become a whistleblower and assist in Commission investigations and enforcement actions does not preclude the Commission from bringing an action against the whistleblower based upon the whistleblower's own conduct in connection with violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commission's regulations. If such an action is determined to be appropriate, however, the Commission's Division of Enforcement will take the whistleblower's cooperation into consideration in accordance with its sanction recommendations to the Commission.

    § 165.17   Awards to whistleblowers who engage in culpable conduct.

#### § § 165.17

    In determining whether the required $1,000,000 threshold has been satisfied for purposes of making any award, the Commission will not take into account any monetary sanctions that the whistleblower is ordered to pay, or that is ordered against any entity whose liability is based primarily on conduct that the whistleblower principally directed, planned, or initiated. Similarly, if the Commission determines that a whistleblower is eligible for an award, any amounts that the whistleblower or such an entity pay in sanctions as a result of the action or related actions will not be included within the calculation of the amounts collected for purposes of making payments pursuant to § 165.14.

    If the whistleblower is a whistleblower who is a director, officer, member, agent, or employee of an entity that has counsel, and the whistleblower has initiated communication with the Commission relating to a potential violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission's staff is authorized to communicate directly with the whistleblower regarding the subject of the whistleblower's communication without seeking the consent of the entity's counsel.

    § 165.19   Nonenforceability of certain provisions waiving rights and remedies or requiring arbitration of disputes.

    (a)  The rights and remedies provided for in this part may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment, including by a predispute arbitration agreement. No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this part.

    (b)  No person may take any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission's staff about a possible violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, including by enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality agreement or predispute arbitration agreement with respect to such communications.

    (ii) Arises out of any retail forex transaction (as defined in § 5.1(m) of this chapter).

    (2) The term  as used in this section includes any person for or on behalf of whom a member of a designated contract market, or a participant transacting on or through such designated contract market, effects a transaction on such contract market, except another member of or participant in such designated contract market.  a person who is an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(18) of the Act shall not be deemed to be a _customer_ within the meaning of this section.

    (c)  No Commission registrant shall enter into any agreement or understanding with a customer in which the customer agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure except as follows:

    (1) Signing the agreement must not be made a condition for the customer to utilize the services offered by the Commission registrant.

    (2) If the agreement is contained as a clause or clauses of a broader agreement, the customer must separately endorse the clause or clauses containing the cautionary language and provisions specified in this section. A futures commission merchant or introducing broker may obtain such endorsement as provided in § 1.55(d) of this chapter for the following classes of customers only:

    (3) The agreement may not require any customer to waive the right to seek reparations under section 14 of the Act and part 12 of this chapter. Accordingly, such customer must be advised in writing that he or she may seek reparations under section 14 of the Act by an election made within 45 days after the Commission registrant notifies the customer that arbitration will be demanded under the agreement. This notice must be given at the time when the Commission registrant notifies the customer of an intention to arbitrate. The customer must also be advised that if he or she seeks reparations under section 14 of the Act and the Commission declines to institute reparations proceedings, the claim or grievance will be subject to the pre-existing arbitration agreement and must also be advised that aspects of the claim or grievance that are not subject to the reparations procedure ( do not constitute a violation of the Act or rules thereunder) may be required to be submitted to the arbitration or other dispute settlement procedure set forth in the pre-existing arbitration agreement.

    (4) The agreement must advise the customer that, at such time as he or she may notify the Commission registrant that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at such time as such person notifies the customer of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration, the customer will have the opportunity to elect a qualified forum for conducting the proceeding.

    (5)  (i) Within ten business days after receipt of notice from the customer that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at the time a Commission registrant notifies the customer of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration, the Commission registrant must provide the customer with a list of organizations whose procedures meet Acceptable Practices established by the Commission for dispute resolution, together with a copy of the rules of each forum listed. The list must include:

    (A) The designated contract market, if applicable and if available, upon which the transaction giving rise to the dispute was executed or could have been executed;

    (B) A registered futures association; and

    (C) At least one other organization that will provide the customer with the opportunity to select the location of the arbitration proceeding from among several major cities in diverse geographic regions and that will provide the customer with the choice of a panel or other decision-maker composed of at least one or more persons, of which at least a majority are not members or associated with a member of the designated contract market, if applicable, or employee thereof, and that are not otherwise associated with the designated contract market (mixed panel), if applicable: Provided, however, that the list of qualified organizations provided by a Commission registrant that is a floor broker need not include a registered futures association unless a registered futures association has been authorized to act as a decision-maker in such matters.

    (ii) The customer shall, within forty-five days after receipt of such list, notify the opposing party of the organization selected. A customer's failure to provide such notice shall give the opposing party the right to select an organization from the list.

    (6)  The agreement must acknowledge that the Commission registrant will pay any incremental fees that may be assessed by a qualified forum for provision of a mixed panel, unless the arbitrators in a particular proceeding determine that the customer has acted in bad faith in initiating or conducting that proceeding.

    (7)  The agreement must include the following language printed in large boldface type:

    (d)  A dispute settlement procedure may require parties utilizing such procedure to agree, under applicable state law, submission agreement or otherwise, to be bound by an award rendered in the procedure, provided that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance to the procedure was made in accordance with paragraph (c) or (g) of this section or that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance was made after the claim or grievance arose. Any award so rendered shall be enforceable in accordance with applicable law.

    (e)  The dispute settlement procedure established by a designated contract market shall not include any unreasonably short limitation period foreclosing submission of customers' claims or grievances or counterclaims.

    (f)  A procedure established by a designated contract market under the Act for the settlement of customers' claims or grievances against a member or employee thereof may permit the submission of a counterclaim in the procedure by a person against whom a claim or grievance is brought. The designated contract market may permit such a counterclaim where the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the customer's claim or grievance and does not require for adjudication the presence of essential witnesses, parties, or third persons over whom the designated contract market does not have jurisdiction. Other counterclaims arising out of a transaction subject to the Act and rules promulgated thereunder for which the customer utilizes the services of the registrant may be permissible where the customer and the registrant have agreed in advance to require that all such submissions be included in the proceeding, and if the aggregate monetary value of the counterclaims is capable of calculation.

    (g)  A person who is an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(12) of the Act may negotiate any term of an agreement or understanding with a Commission registrant in which the eligible contract participant agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure provided for in the agreement.

These rules shall set forth the ethical standards for members of the association in their business dealings with the public. An applicant association must also demonstrate its capability to foster a professional atmosphere among its members, including an acceptance of an adherence to the ethical standards, and to monitor and enforce compliance with the customer and option customer protection program and rules.

      (b) Conduct proceedings in a manner consistent with the fundamental elements of due process; and

#### § § 170.7

      (a)  Unless specifically excluded by subsection (b), this part governs review by the Commission, pursuant to sections 17(h), (i) and (o) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), as amended, of any disciplinary action, membership denial action, registration action or member responsibility action taken by the National Futures Association or any registered futures association. Unless specifically indicated, references in this part to the National Futures Association shall also include any other registered futures association.

      (b)  The Commission will not review under these rules the following decisions by the National Futures Association:

      (1) A decision in a disciplinary action if the party aggrieved by the decision knowingly failed to pursue the right to appeal an adverse decision to the Appeals Committee of the National Futures Association and there are no extraordinary circumstances that otherwise warrant Commission consideration of the aggrieved party's appeal;

      (2) A decision in an arbitration action brought pursuant to section 17(b)(10) of the Act or any rule of the National Futures Association;

      (3) Suspension of a member based solely on that member's failure to pay National Futures Association dues;

      (4) A decision to disqualify any member for service on the National Futures Association Board of Directors, Business Conduct Committees, Hearing Committee or arbitration panels pursuant to the standards for service adopted by the National Futures Association to implement Commission rule 1.63;

      (c)  If the General Counsel, or any employee under the General Counsel's supervision as the General Counsel may designate, determines that a notice of appeal submitted to the Commission is from a decision that is excluded from review under this part, the notice of appeal may be stricken and ordered to be returned to the aggrieved party who submitted it.

      (b)  If the Commission finds that the result reached in the decision of the National Futures Association is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appellant raise important questions of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the decision without opinion. The decision of the National Futures Association shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service.

      (4) The conclusion of the National Futures Association is not consistent with the purposes of the Act.

    Subpart D—Commission Review of Decisions by the National Futures Association In Member Responsibility Actions

      § 171.40   Notice of the commencement of a member responsibility action.

#### § § 171.40

      The notice of a Member Responsibility Action provided by the National Futures Association pursuant to its rules shall advise the affected parties of their right to petition the Commission pursuant to § 171.41 to stay the effective date of the action pending a hearing before the National Futures Association on the factual issues relevant to the suspension, restriction or remedial action ordered.

      § 171.41   Petition for a stay of effective date of a member responsibility action pending a hearing by the National Futures Association.

#### § § 171.41

      (a)  Within ten days after the National Futures Association serves the notice required by § 171.40, any party aggrieved by the National Futures Association's determination that the member responsibility action should be effective prior to the opportunity for a hearing on the factual issues relevant to the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed may petition the Commission to stay its effectiveness pending completion of further proceedings by the National Futures Association. The burden of persuasion shall rest with the party seeking the stay.

      (b)  A petition for stay shall meet the content requirements set forth in § 171.22(b)(3).

      (c)  A response may be filed by the National Futures Association in accordance with § 171.22(b)(4).

      (d)  In reviewing petitions to stay the effectiveness of the member responsibility action pending completion of further proceedings, the Commission shall consider:

      (1) Whether, in the circumstances presented, the notice and opportunity for a hearing provided by the National Futures Association are consistent with principles of fundamental fairness; and

      (2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to petitioner; and

      (3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the interests of the National Futures Association; and

      (4) The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the public interest.

      (e) If the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Assocation in a member responsibility action is effective at the time a petition for a stay is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall not delay its decision on the petition to await the receipt of the National Futures Association's response. If the action is not effective at the time the petition is filed, the Commission will not act upon the petition prior to the receipt of a response from the National Futures Association unless, in its view, expedited action on the petition is necessary to protect petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the right to a stay. If the Commission grants the petition prior to the receipt of the response of the National Futures Association, the association may seek reconsideration of the Commission's action within seven days of service of the decision.

      (f)  If the petition for a stay is denied, the National Futures Association shall continue its action in accordance with the applicable rules of the association. If the petition for a stay is granted, the action shall be remanded to the National Futures Association for further proceedings as provided in the Commission's decision. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, a stay issued pursuant to this section shall not deprive the National Futures Association of the authority, after conducting a hearing under the appropriate rules of the association, to make the suspension, restriction or remedial action ordered in the member responsibility action immediately effective at the time a final decision is issued.

      § 171.42   Notice of a final decision of the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action.

#### § § 171.42

      (a)  The National Futures Association shall promptly serve all parties, as well as the Proceeding Clerk and Secretary of the Commission, with a written notice of any final decision in a member responsibility action. The notice may be contained in the written decision issued by the National Futures Association. If the National Futures Association determines that the decision shall be effective upon issuance, in addition to serving a written notice, it shall also contact the parties and the Proceedings Clerk by telephone to inform them of its determination.

      (b)  At a minimum, the notice shall provide the following information:

      (1) The name of the parties to the proceeding;

      (2) The date the notice was served and the effective date of the decision;

      (3) A statement informing the parties of their right to appeal the decision to the Commission pursuant to § 171.44 as well as their right to seek a stay of the decision pending Commission consideration of their appeal pursuant to § 171.43;

      (4) A description of the action taken and the reasons for the action;

      (5) Findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues relevant to its decision;

      (6) A determination of the appropriate relief based on the findings and conclusions.

      § 171.43   Petition for a stay of the effective date of a final decision of the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action.

#### § § 171.43

      (a)  Within ten days of the service of the notice described in § 171.42, any aggrived party may seek from the Commission a stay of the effective date of the decision of the National Futures Association pending consideration of the merits of an appeal by filing and serving an appropriate petition. The mere filing of such a petition shall not stay the effective date of the decision. The burden of persuasion shall rest with the party seeking the stay.

      (b)  A petition for a stay shall be in writing. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.

      (c)  Within five days of the service of the petition, the National Futures Association may file an opposition to the petition. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.

      (d)  In reviewing petitions filed under this section, the Commission shall consider:

      (1) The likelihood that petitioner's challenge to the merits of the decision will be successful; and

      (2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to the petitioner; and

      (3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the National Futures Association; and

      (4) The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the public interest.

      (e)  If the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action is effective at the time a petition for a stay is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall not delay its decision on the petition to await the receipt of the National Futures Association's response. If the decision is not effective at the time the petition is filed, the Commission will not act upon the petition prior to the receipt of a response from the National Futures Association unless, in its view, expedited action on the petition is necessary to protect petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the right to a stay. If the Commission grants the petition prior to the receipt of the response of the National Futures Association, the association may seek reconsideration of the Commission's action within seven days of service of the decision.

      § 171.44   Notice of appeal.

#### § § 171.44

      (a)  Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action may, within thirty days of the service of the notice described in § 171.42, file with the Proceedings Clerk and serve on the National Futures Association a notice of appeal. The filing of such a notice shall not stay the effective date of the decision.

      § 171.45   General procedures.

#### § § 171.45

      The following procedural rules applicable to review of decisions of the National Futures Association in disciplinary, membership denial and registration actions shall also apply to the review of decisions of the National Futures Association in member responsibility actions:

      (c) The weight of the evidence supports the findings of the National Futures Association concerning the reasons for the action;

      (d) The determination that summary action is necessary to protect the commodity futures markets, customers, or members of the National Futures Association rests on a reasonable interpretation of the NFA rules at issue;

      (e) The National Futures Association's application of its rules is consistent with the purposes of the Act;

      (f) In light of the findings of the National Futures Association concerning the reasons for the action and the public interest, the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Association is not excessive, oppressive or an abuse of discretion.

    Subpart E—Delegation of Functions

      § 171.50   Delegation to the General Counsel.

#### § § 171.50

      (a) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the General Counsel, or any employee under the General Counsel's supervision as the General Counsel may designate, the authority:

      (1) To waive or modify any of the requirements of §§ 171.25, 171.26, 171.27 and to waive or modify any requirement of the part 171 Rules insofar as it pertains to changes in the time permitted for filing, or the form, execution, service and filing of documents;

      (2) To enter orders under §§ 171.10, 171.12, 171.21 and 171.31(c);

      (3) To decline to accept any notice of appeal, or petition for stay pending review, of matters specified in § 171.1(b) and to so notify the appellant and the registered futures association;

      (4) To stay the effective date of a decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary, membership denial or registration action, or a decision relating to such actions issued by the Commission pursuant to these rules, for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 days, when such a stay is necessary to allow the Commission to consider a petition to stay the effective date of such a decision or a motion for similar relief;

      (5) To decline to accept any document which has not been filed or perfected as specified in these rules;

      (6) To determine motions seeking permission to participate in a proceeding under § 171.27 and to establish the related briefing schedule;

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 190.00   Statutory authority, organization, core concepts, scope, and construction.

#### § § 190.00

      (a)  The Commission has adopted the regulations in this part pursuant to its authority under sections 8a(5) and 20 of the Act. Section 8a(5) provides general rulemaking authority to effectuate the provisions and accomplish the purposes of the Act. Section 20 provides that the Commission may, notwithstanding title 11 of the United States Code, adopt certain rules or regulations governing a proceeding involving a commodity broker that is a debtor under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Specifically, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules or regulations specifying:

      (1) That certain cash, securities, or other property, or commodity contracts, are to be included in or excluded from customer property or member property;

      (2) That certain cash, securities, or other property, or commodity contracts, are to be specifically identifiable to a particular customer in a particular capacity;

      (3) The method by which the business of the commodity broker is to be conducted or liquidated after the date of the filing of the petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, including the payment and allocation of margin with respect to commodity contracts not specifically identifiable to a particular customer pending their orderly liquidation;

      (4) Any persons to which customer property and commodity contracts may be transferred under section 766 of the Bankruptcy Code; and

      (5) How a customer's net equity is to be determined.

      (b)  This part is organized into three subparts. This subpart contains general provisions applicable in all cases. Subpart B of this part contains provisions that apply when the debtor is a futures commission merchant (as that term is defined in the Act or Commission regulations). This includes acting as a foreign futures commission merchant, as defined in section 761(12) of the Bankruptcy Code, but excludes a person that is “notice-registered” as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(2) of the Act. Subpart C contains provisions that apply when the debtor is registered as a derivatives clearing organization under the Act.

      (c)  The regulations in this part reflect several core concepts. The descriptions of core concepts in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section are subject to the further specific requirements set forth in this part, and the specific requirements in this part should be interpreted and applied consistently with these core concepts.

      (1)  Subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code applies to a debtor that is a commodity broker, against which a customer holds a “net equity” claim relating to a commodity contract. This part is limited to a commodity broker that is:

      (i) A futures commission merchant; or

      (ii) A derivatives clearing organization registered under the Act and § 39.3 of this chapter.

      (2)  The Act and Commission regulations in parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter provide differing treatment and protections for different types of cleared commodity contracts. This part establishes three account classes that correspond to the different types of accounts that futures commission merchants and clearing organizations are required to maintain under the regulations in the preceding sentence, specifically, the futures account class (including options on futures), the foreign futures account class (including options on foreign futures), and the cleared swaps account class (including cleared options other than options on futures or foreign futures). This part also establishes a fourth account class, the delivery account class (which may be further subdivided as provided in this part), for property held in an account designated within the books and records of the debtor as a delivery account, for effecting delivery under commodity contracts whose terms require settlement via delivery when the commodity contract is held to expiration or, in the case of a cleared option, is exercised.

      (3) —(i)  This part prescribes separate treatment of “public customers” and “non-public customers” (as these terms are defined in § 190.01) within each account class in the event of a proceeding under this part in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant. Public customers of a debtor futures commission merchant are entitled to a priority in the distribution of cash, securities, or other customer property over non-public customers, and both have priority over all other claimants (except for claims relating to the administration of customer property) pursuant to section 766(h) of the Bankruptcy Code.

      (A) The cash, securities, or other property held on behalf of the public customers of a futures commission merchant in the futures, foreign futures, or cleared swaps account classes are subject to special segregation requirements imposed under parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter for each account class. Although such segregation requirements generally are not applicable to cash, securities, or other property received from or reflected in the futures, foreign futures, or cleared swaps accounts of non-public customers of a futures commission merchant, such transactions and property are customer property within the scope of this part.

      (B) While parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter do not impose special segregation requirements with respect to treatment of cash, securities, or other property of public customers carried in a delivery account, such property does constitute customer property. Thus, the distinction between public and non-public customers is, given the priority for public customers in section 766(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, relevant for the purpose of making distributions to delivery account class customers pursuant to this part.

      (C) Where a provision in this part affords the trustee discretion, that discretion should be exercised in a manner that the trustee determines will best achieve the overarching goal of protecting public customers as a class by enhancing recoveries for, and mitigating disruptions to, public customers as a class. In seeking to achieve that overarching goal, the trustee has discretion to balance those two sub-goals when they are in tension. Where the trustee is directed to exercise “reasonable efforts” to meet a standard, those efforts should only be less than “best efforts” to the extent that the trustee determines that such an approach would support the foregoing goals.

      (ii)  For a clearing organization, “customer property” is divided into “member property” and “customer property other than member property.” The term member property is used to identify the cash, securities, or property available to pay the net equity claims of clearing members based on their house account at the clearing organization. Thus, in the event of a proceeding under this part in which the debtor is a clearing organization, the classification of customers as public customers or non-public customers also is relevant, in that each member of the clearing organization will have separate claims against the clearing organization (by account class) with respect to:

      (A) Commodity contract transactions cleared for its own account or on behalf of any of its non-public customers (which are cleared in a “house account” at the clearing organization); and

      (B) Commodity contract transactions cleared on behalf of any public customers of the clearing member (which are cleared in accounts at the clearing organization that is separate and distinct from house accounts).

      (iii)  Section 190.18 is designed to support the interests of public customers of members of a debtor that is a clearing organization.

      (A) Certain customer property is preferentially assigned to “customer property other than member property” instead of “member property” to the extent that there is a shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims. Moreover, to the extent that there are excess funded balances for members' claims in any customer class/account class combination, that excess is also preferentially assigned to “customer property other than member property” to the extent of any shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims.

      (B) Where property is assigned to a particular customer class with more than one account class, it is assigned to the account class for which the funded balance percentage is the lowest until there are two account classes with equal funded balance percentages, then to both such account classes, keeping the funded balance percentage the same, and so forth following the analogous approach if the debtor has more than two account classes within the relevant customer class.

      (4)  In a proceeding in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant, this part sets out a policy preference for transferring to another futures commission merchant, or “porting,” open commodity contract positions of the debtor's public customers along with all or a portion of such customers' account equity. Porting mitigates risks to both the customers of the debtor futures commission merchant and to the markets. To facilitate porting, this part addresses the manner in which the debtor's business is to be conducted on and after the filing date, with specific provisions addressing the collection and payment of margin for open commodity contract positions prior to porting.

      (5)  (i) The commodity broker provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, subchapter IV of chapter 7, in particular section 766(h), have long revolved around the principle of pro rata distribution. If there is a shortfall in the cash, securities or other property in a particular account class needed to satisfy the net equity claims of public customers in that account class, the customer property in that account class will be distributed pro rata to those public customers (subject to appendix B of this part). Any customer property not attributable to a specific account class, or that exceeds the amount needed to pay allowed customer net equity claims in a particular account class, will be distributed to public customers in other account classes so long as there is a shortfall in those other classes. Non-public customers will not receive any distribution of customer property so long as there is any shortfall, in any account class, of customer property needed to satisfy public customer net equity claims.

      (ii) The pro rata distribution principle means that, if there is a shortfall of customer property in an account class, all customers within that account class will suffer the same proportional loss relative to their allowed net equity claims. The principle in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) applies to all customers, including those who post as collateral specifically identifiable property or letters of credit. The pro rata distribution principle is subject to the special distribution provisions set forth in framework 1 in appendix B of this part for cross-margin accounts and framework 2 in appendix B of this part for funds held outside of the U.S. or held in non-U.S. currency.

      (6)  (i) Commodity contracts may have terms that require a customer owning the contract:

      (A) To make or take delivery of the underlying commodity if the customer holds the contract to a delivery position; or

      (B) In the case of an option on a commodity:

      () To make delivery upon exercise (as the buyer of a put option or seller of a call option); or

      () To take delivery upon exercise (as seller of a put option or buyer of a call option).

      (ii) Depending upon the circumstances and relevant market, delivery may be effected via a delivery account, a futures account, a foreign futures account or a cleared swaps account, or, when the commodity subject to delivery is a security, in a securities account (in which case property associated with the delivery held in a securities account is not part of any customer account class for purposes of this part).

      (iii) Although commodity contracts with delivery obligations are typically offset before reaching the delivery stage ( prior to triggering bilateral delivery obligations), when delivery obligations do arise, a delivery default could have a disruptive effect on the cash market for the commodity and adversely impact the parties to the transaction. This part therefore sets out special provisions to address open commodity contracts that are settled by delivery, when those positions are nearing or have entered into a delivery position at the time of or after the filing date. The delivery provisions in this part are intended to allow deliveries to be completed in accordance with the rules and established practices for the relevant commodity contract market or clearing organization, as applicable and to the extent permitted under this part.

      (iv) In a proceeding in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant, the delivery provisions in this part reflect policy preferences to:

      (A) Liquidate commodity contracts that settle via delivery before they move into a delivery position; and

      (B) When such contracts are in a delivery position, to allow delivery to occur, where practicable, outside administration of the debtor's estate.

      (v) The delivery provisions in this part apply to any commodity that is subject to delivery under a commodity contract, as the term commodity is defined in section of 1a(9) of the Act, whether the commodity itself is tangible or intangible, including agricultural commodities as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter, other non-financial commodities (such as metals or energy commodities) covered by the definition of exempt commodity in section 1a(20) of the Act, and commodities that are financial in nature (such as foreign currencies) covered by the definition of excluded commodity in section 1a(19) of the Act. The delivery provisions also apply to virtual currencies that are subject to delivery under a commodity contract.

      (d) —(1) —(i)  (A) Section 101(6) of the Bankruptcy Code recognizes “futures commission merchants” and “foreign futures commission merchants,” as those terms are defined in section 761(12) of the Bankruptcy Code, as separate categories of commodity broker. The definition of commodity broker in § 190.01, as it applies to a commodity broker that is a futures commission merchant under the Act, also covers foreign futures commission merchants because a foreign futures commission merchant is required to register as a futures commission merchant under the Act.

      (B) Section 101(6) of the Bankruptcy Code recognizes “commodity options dealers,” and “leverage transaction merchants” as defined in sections 761(6) and (13) of the Bankruptcy Code, as separate categories of commodity brokers. There are no commodity options dealers or leverage transaction merchants as of December 8, 2020.

      (ii)  Pursuant to section 7(b) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. 78fff-1(b), the trustee in a SIPA proceeding, where the debtor also is a commodity broker, has the same duties as a trustee in a proceeding under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent consistent with the provisions of SIPA or as otherwise ordered by the court. This part therefore also applies to a proceeding commenced under SIPA with respect to a debtor that is registered as a broker or dealer under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when the debtor also is a futures commission merchant.

      (iii)  Section 5390(m)(1)(B) of title 12 of the United States Code provides that the FDIC must apply the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the distribution of customer property and member property in connection with the liquidation of a covered financial company or a bridge financial company (as those terms are defined in section 5381(a) of title 12) that is a commodity broker as if such person were a debtor for purposes of subchapter IV, except as specifically provided in section 5390 of title 12. This part therefore shall serve as guidance as to such distribution of property in a proceeding in which the FDIC is acting as a receiver pursuant to title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to a covered financial company or bridge financial company that is a commodity broker whose liquidation otherwise would be administered by a trustee under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

      (2)  (i) The trustee may not recognize any account class that is not one of the account classes enumerated in § 190.01.

      (ii) No property that would otherwise be included in customer property, as defined in § 190.01, shall be excluded from customer property because such property is considered to be held in a constructive, resulting, or other trust that is implied in equity.

      (3)  For purposes of this part, the following are excluded from the term “commodity contract”:

      (i) Options on commodities (including swaps subject to regulation under part 32 of this chapter) that are not centrally cleared by a clearing organization or foreign clearing organization.

      (ii) Transactions, contracts or agreements that are classified as “forward contracts” under the Act pursuant to the exclusion from the term “future delivery” set out in section 1a(27) of the Act or the exclusion from the definition of a “swap” under section 1a(47)(B)(ii) of the Act, in each case that are not centrally cleared by a clearing organization or foreign clearing organization.

      (iii) Security futures products as defined in section 1a(45) of the Act when such products are held in a securities account.

      (iv) Any off-exchange retail foreign currency transaction, contract or agreement described in sections 2(c)(2)(B) or (C) of the Act.

      (v) Any security-based swap or other security (as defined in section 3 of the Exchange Act), but a security futures product or a mixed swap (as defined in 1a(47)(D) of the Act) that is, in either case, carried in an account for which there is a corresponding account class under this part is not so excluded.

      (vi) Any off-exchange retail commodity transaction, contract or agreement described in section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, unless such transaction, contract or agreement is traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market or foreign board of trade as, or as if, such transaction, contract, or agreement is a futures contract.

      (e)  (1) A reference in this part to a specific section of a Federal statute or specific regulation refers to such section or regulation as the same may be amended or superseded.

      (2) Where they differ, the definitions set forth in § 190.01 shall be used instead of defined terms set forth in section 761 of the Bankruptcy Code. In many cases, these definitions are based on definitions in parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter.

      (i) Thus, as noted in paragraph (2) of the definition of  in § 190.01, where open commodity contracts (and associated collateral) that would be attributable to one _account class_ are, instead, commingled with the commodity contracts (and associated collateral) in a second account class (the “home field”), then the trustee must treat all such commodity contracts and collateral as part of, and consistent with the regulations applicable to, the second account class.

      (ii) The concept in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, that the rules of the “home field” will apply, also pertains to securities positions that are, pursuant to an approved cross margining program, held in a commodities account class (in which case the rules of that commodities account class will apply) and to commodities positions that are, pursuant to an approved cross-margining program, held in a securities account (in which case, the rules of the securities account will apply, consistent with section 16(2)(b)(ii) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(b)(ii)).

      (3) The Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, or members of the Commission staff designated by the Director, shall grant, deny, or otherwise respond to a request, on the basis of the information provided in any such request and after consultation with the Director of the Market Participants Division or members of the Commission staff designated by the Director, unless exigent circumstances require immediate action precluding such prior consultation, and shall communicate that determination by the most appropriate means to the person making the request.

      (b)  (1) Until such time as the Commission orders otherwise, the Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, and to such members of the Commission's staff acting under the Director's direction as they may designate, after consultation with the Director of the Market Participants Division, or such members of the Commission's staff under the Director's direction as they may designate, unless exigent circumstances require immediate action, all the functions of the Commission set forth in this part, except the authority to disapprove a pre-relief transfer of a public customer commodity contract account or customer property pursuant to § 190.07(e)(1).

      (2) The Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated to the Director pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c)  For purposes of this part, an entity for or with whom the debtor deals who holds a claim against the debtor solely on account of a forward contract, that is not cleared by a clearing organization, will not be deemed to be a customer.

      (d)  The Bankruptcy Code will not be construed by the Commission to prohibit a commodity broker from doing business as any combination of the following: Futures commission merchant, commodity options dealer, foreign futures commission merchant, or leverage transaction merchant, nor will the Commission construe the Bankruptcy Code to permit any operation, trade, or business, or any combination of the foregoing, otherwise prohibited by the Act or by any of the Commission's regulations in this chapter, or by any order of the Commission.

      (e)  Contracts in security futures products held in a securities account shall not be considered to be “from or for the commodity futures account” or “from or for the commodity options account” of such customers, as such terms are used in section 761(9) of the Bankruptcy Code.

      (f)  In the event that a receiver for a futures commission merchant is appointed due to the violation or imminent violation of the customer property protection requirements of section 4d of the Act, or of the regulations in part 1, 22, or 30 of this chapter that implement section 4d or 4(b)(2) of the Act, or of the futures commission merchant's minimum capital requirements in § 1.17 of this chapter, such receiver may, in an appropriate case, file a petition for bankruptcy of such futures commission merchant pursuant to section 301 of the Bankruptcy Code.

      (g)  The term “allowed” in this part shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Bankruptcy Code.

Such notice must specify the manner for providing such instructions and the deadline by which the customer must provide instructions.

      (C) Such notice must also inform the customer that:

      () (Where instructions have been requested pursuant to paragraph (c)(_2_)(ii)(B)() of this section), if the customer does not provide instructions in the prescribed manner and by the prescribed deadline, the customer's open commodity contracts will not be treated as specifically identifiable property under this part;

      () Any transfer of the open commodity contracts is subject to the terms for distribution contained in § 190.09(d)(_2_);

      () Absent compliance with any terms imposed by the trustee or the court, the trustee may liquidate the open commodity contracts; and

      () Providing (or having provided) instructions may not prevent the open commodity contracts from being liquidated.

      (d)  The trustee shall promptly provide the Commission with copies of any complaint, motion, or petition filed in a commodity broker bankruptcy which concerns the disposition of customer property. Court filings shall be directed to the Commission addressed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (e)  The trustee shall request that customers provide, to the extent reasonably practicable, information sufficient to determine a customer's claim in accordance with the regulations contained in this part, including in the discretion of the trustee:

      (1) The class of commodity contract account upon which each claim is based ( futures account, foreign futures account, cleared swaps account, or delivery account (and, in the case of a delivery account, how much is based on cash delivery property and how much is based on the value of physical delivery property);

      (2) Whether the claimant is a public customer or a non-public customer;

      (3) The number of commodity contract accounts held by each claimant, and, for each such account:

      (i) The account number;

      (ii) The name in which the account is held;

      (iii) The balance as of the last account statement for the account, and information regarding any activity in the account from the date of the last account statement up to and including the filing date that affected the balance of the account;

      (iv) The capacity in which the account is held;

      (v) Whether the account is a joint account and, if so, the amount of the claimant's percentage interest in that account and whether participants in the joint account are claiming jointly or separately;

      (vi) Whether the account is a discretionary account;

      (6) A description of all claims of the debtor against the claimant not included in the balance of a commodity contract account of the claimant;

      (7) A description of and the value of any open positions, unliquidated securities, or other unliquidated property held by the debtor on behalf of the claimant, indicating the portion of such property, if any, which was included in the information provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and identifying any such property which would be specifically identifiable property as defined in § 190.01;

      (1) If there are no open commodity contracts that are being treated as specifically identifiable property (e.g., if the customer proof of claim form was distributed after the primary liquidation date), the trustee should modify the customer proof of claim form to delete references to open commodity contracts as specifically identifiable property.

      (2) In the event the trustee determines that the debtor's books and records reflecting customer transactions are not reasonably reliable, or account statements are not available from which account balances as of the date of transfer or liquidation of customer property may be determined, the proof of claim form used by the trustee should be modified to take into account the particular facts and circumstances of the case.

      § 190.04   Operation of the debtor's estate—customer property.

#### § § 190.04

      (a) —(1)  The trustee for a commodity broker shall promptly use its best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.07(c) and (d) no later than the seventh calendar day after the order for relief of the open commodity contracts and property held by the commodity broker for or on behalf of its public customers.

      (2)  A commodity broker against which an involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed, or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed in such case, shall use its best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.07(c) and (d) of all open commodity contracts and property held by the commodity broker for or on behalf of its public customers and such other property as the Commission in its discretion may authorize, on or before the seventh calendar day after the filing date, and immediately cease doing business;  that if the commodity broker demonstrates to the Commission within such period that it was in compliance with the segregation and financial requirements of this chapter on the filing date, and the Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that such transfer is neither appropriate nor in the public interest, the commodity broker may continue in business subject to applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and of this chapter.

      (b) —(1)  Prior to the primary liquidation date, the trustee may make payments of initial margin and variation settlement to a clearing organization, commodity broker, foreign clearing organization, or foreign futures intermediary, carrying the account of the debtor, pending the transfer, or liquidation of any open commodity contracts, whether or not such contracts are specifically identifiable property of a particular customer, provided, that:

      (i) To the extent within the trustee's control, the trustee shall not make any payments on behalf of any commodity contract account on the books and records of the debtor that is in deficit;  that the provision in this paragraph (b)(1) shall not be construed to prevent a clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, futures commission merchant, or foreign futures intermediary carrying an account of the debtor from exercising its rights to the extent permitted under applicable law;

      (ii) Any margin payments made by the trustee with respect to a specific customer account shall not exceed the funded balance for that account;

      (iii) The trustee shall not make any payments on behalf of non-public customers of the debtor from funds that are segregated for the benefit of public customers;

      (iv) If the trustee receives payments from a customer in response to a margin call, then to the extent within the trustee's control, the trustee must use such payments to make margin payments for the open commodity contract positions of such customer;

      (v) The trustee may not use payments received from one public customer to meet the margin (or any other) obligations of any other customer; and

      (vi) If funds segregated for the benefit of public customers in a particular account class exceed the aggregate net equity claims for all public customers in such account class, the trustee may use such excess funds to meet the margin obligations for any public customer in such account class whose account is under-margined (as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) but not in deficit, provided that the trustee issues a margin call to such customer and provided further that the trustee shall liquidate such customer's open commodity contracts if the customer fails to make the margin payment within a reasonable time as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (2)  The trustee (or, prior to appointment of the trustee, the debtor against which an involuntary petition was filed) may issue a margin call to any public customer whose commodity contract account contains open commodity contracts if such account is under-margined.

      (3)  The full amount of any margin payment by a customer in response to a margin call under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be credited to the funded balance of the particular account for which it was made.

      (4)  The trustee shall, as soon as practicable under the circumstances, liquidate all open commodity contracts in any commodity contract account that is in deficit, or for which any mark-to-market calculation would result in a deficit, or for which the customer fails to meet a margin call made by the trustee within a reasonable time. Except as otherwise provided in this part, absent exigent circumstances, a reasonable time for meeting margin calls made by the trustee shall be deemed to be one hour, or such greater period not to exceed one business day, as the trustee may determine in its sole discretion.

      (5)  In the event that a clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, futures commission merchant, foreign futures intermediary, or other person carrying a commodity customer account for the debtor in the nature of an omnibus account has liquidated only a portion of open commodity contracts in such account, the trustee will exercise reasonable business judgment in assigning the liquidating transactions to the underlying commodity customer accounts carried by the debtor. Specifically, the trustee should endeavor to assign the contracts as follows: First, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any accounts that are in deficit; second, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any accounts that are undermargined; third, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any other accounts, and finally to liquidate any remaining open commodity contracts in any accounts. If more than one commodity contract account reflects open commodity contracts in a particular account class for which liquidating transactions have been executed, the trustee shall to the extent practicable allocate the liquidating transactions to such commodity contract accounts pro rata based on the number of open commodity contracts of such commodity contract accounts. For purposes of this section, the term “a risk-reducing manner” is measured by margin requirements set using the margin methodology and parameters followed by the derivatives clearing organization at which such contracts are cleared.

      (c)  After entry of the order for relief and subject to paragraph (a) of this section, which requires the trustee to attempt to make transfers to other commodity brokers permitted by § 190.07 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the trustee shall use its best efforts to liquidate any open commodity contract that settles upon expiration or exercise via the making or taking of delivery of a commodity:

      (1) If such contract is a futures contract or a cleared swaps contract, before the earlier of the last trading day or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, or otherwise before the debtor or its customer incurs an obligation to make or take delivery of the commodity under such contract;

      (2) If such contract is a long option on a commodity and has value, before the first date on which the contract could be automatically exercised or the last date on which the contract could be exercised if not subject to automatic exercise; or

      (3) If such contract is a short option on a commodity that is in-the-money in favor of the long position holder, before the first date on which the long option position could be exercised.

      (d)  After entry of the order for relief and subject to paragraph (a) of this section, which requires the trustee to attempt to make transfers to other commodity brokers permitted by § 190.07 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph (d), the following commodity contracts and other property held by or for the account of a debtor must be liquidated in the market in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section or liquidated via book entry in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section by the trustee promptly and in an orderly manner:

      (1)  All open commodity contracts, except for:

      (i) Commodity contracts that are specifically identifiable property (if applicable) and are subject to customer instructions to transfer (in lieu of liquidating) as provided in § 190.03(c)(2), provided that the customer is in compliance with the terms of § 190.09(d)(2); and

      (ii) Open commodity contract positions that are in a delivery position, which shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of § 190.06.

      (2)  Specifically identifiable property, other than open commodity contracts or physical delivery property, to the extent that:

      (i) The fair market value of such property is less than 75% of its fair market value on the date of entry of the order for relief;

      (ii) Failure to liquidate the specifically identifiable property may result in a deficit balance in the applicable customer account; or

      (iii) The trustee has not received instructions to return pursuant to § 190.03(c)(1), or has not returned such property upon the terms contained in § 190.09(d)(1).

      (3)  The trustee may request that a customer deliver substitute customer property with respect to any letter of credit received, acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase, or sell a commodity contract, whether the letter of credit is held by the trustee on behalf of the debtor's estate or a derivatives clearing organization or a foreign intermediary or foreign clearing organization on a pass-through or other basis, including in cases where the letter of credit has expired since the date of the order for relief. The amount of the request may equal the full face amount of the letter of the credit or any portion thereof, to the extent required or may be required in the trustee's discretion to ensure pro rata treatment among customer claims within each account class, consistent with §§ 190.08 and 190.09.

      (i) If a customer fails to provide substitute customer property within a reasonable time specified by the trustee, the trustee may, if the letter of credit has not expired, draw upon the full amount of the letter of credit or any portion thereof.

      (ii) For any letter of credit referred to in this paragraph (d)(3), the trustee shall treat any portion that is not drawn upon (less the value of any substitute customer property delivered by the customer) as having been distributed to the customer for purposes of calculating entitlements to distribution or transfer. The expiration of the letter of credit on or at any time after the date of the order for relief shall not affect such calculation.

      (iii) Any proceeds of a letter of credit drawn by the trustee, or substitute customer property posted by a customer, shall be considered customer property in the account class applicable to the original letter of credit.

      (iv) The trustee shall, in exercising their discretion with regard to addressing letters of credit, including as to the timing and amount of a request for substitute customer property, endeavor to mitigate, to the extent practicable, the adverse effects upon customers that have posted letters of credit, in a manner that achieves  treatment among customer claims.

      (4)  All other property, other than physical delivery property held for delivery in accordance with the provisions of § 190.06, which is not required to be transferred or returned pursuant to customer instructions and which has not been liquidated in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.

      (e) —(1) —(i)  For open commodity contracts cleared by the debtor as a member of a clearing organization, the trustee or clearing organization, as applicable, shall liquidate such open commodity contracts pursuant to the rules of the clearing organization, a designated contract market, or a swap execution facility, if and as applicable. Any such rules providing for liquidation other than on the open market shall be designed to achieve, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation, a process for liquidating open commodity contracts that results in competitive pricing. For open commodity contracts that are futures or options on futures that were established on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade and cleared by the debtor as a member of a foreign clearing organization, the trustee shall liquidate such open commodity contracts pursuant to the rules of the foreign clearing organization or foreign board of trade or, in the absence of such rules, in the manner the trustee determines appropriate.

      (ii)  For open commodity contracts submitted by the debtor for clearing through one or more accounts established with a futures commission merchant (as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter) or foreign futures intermediary, the trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate the open commodity contracts to achieve competitive pricing, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation and subject to any rules or orders of the relevant clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, designated contract market, swap execution facility, or foreign board of trade governing the liquidation of open commodity contracts.

      (2)  Upon application by the trustee or clearing organization, the Commission may permit open commodity contracts to be liquidated, or settlement on such contracts to be made, by book entry. Such book entry shall offset open commodity contracts, whether matched or not matched on the books of the commodity broker, using the settlement price for such commodity contracts as determined by the clearing organization in accordance with its rules. Such rules shall be designed to establish, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation, such settlement prices in a competitive manner.

      (3)  For open commodity contracts cleared by the debtor through one or more accounts established with a futures commission merchant or a foreign futures intermediary, such futures commission merchant or foreign futures intermediary may exercise any enforceable contractual rights it has to liquidate such commodity contracts, provided, that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate the open commodity contracts to achieve competitive pricing, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation and subject to any rules or orders of the relevant clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, designated contract market, swap execution facility, or foreign board of trade governing its liquidation of such open commodity contracts. If a futures commission merchant or foreign futures intermediary fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate open commodity contracts to achieve competitive pricing in accordance with this paragraph (e)(3), the trustee may seek damages reflecting the difference between the price (or prices) at which the relevant commodity contracts would have been liquidated using commercially reasonable efforts to achieve competitive pricing and the price (or prices) at which the commodity contracts were liquidated, which shall be the sole remedy available to the trustee. In no event shall any such liquidation be voided.

      (4)  (i) Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to permit the trustee to purchase or sell new commodity contracts for the debtor or its customers except to offset open commodity contracts or to transfer any transferable notice received by the debtor or the trustee under any commodity contract;  that the trustee may, in its discretion and with approval of the Commission, cover uncovered inventory or commodity contracts of the debtor which cannot be liquidated immediately because of price limits or other market conditions, or may take an offsetting position in a new month or at a strike price for which limits have not been reached.

      (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the trustee may, with the written permission of the Commission, operate the business of the debtor in the ordinary course, including the purchase or sale of new commodity contracts on behalf of the customers of the debtor under appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Commission.

      (f)  Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the trustee shall use its best efforts to assure that a commodity contract that is a long option contract with value does not expire worthless.

      § 190.05   Operation of the debtor's estate—general.

#### § § 190.05

      (a)  Except as specifically provided otherwise in this part, the trustee shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all of the provisions of the Act and of the regulations in this chapter as if it were the debtor.

      (b)  The trustee shall use reasonable efforts to compute a funded balance for each customer account that contains open commodity contracts or other property as of the close of business each business day subsequent to the order for relief until the date all open commodity contracts and other property in such account have been transferred or liquidated, which shall be as accurate as reasonably practicable under the circumstances, including the reliability and availability of information.

      (c) —(1)  Except as otherwise ordered by the court or as permitted by the Commission, records required under this chapter to be maintained by the debtor, including records of the computations required by this part, shall be maintained by the trustee until such time as the debtor's case is closed.

      (2)  The records required to be maintained by paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be available during business hours to the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. The trustee shall give the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice access to all records of the debtor, including records required to be retained in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter and all other records of the commodity broker, whether or not the Act or this chapter would require such records to be maintained by the commodity broker.

      (d)  The trustee shall use all reasonable efforts to continue to issue account statements with respect to any customer for whose account open commodity contracts or other property is held that has not been liquidated or transferred. With respect to such accounts, the trustee must also issue an account statement reflecting any liquidation or transfer of open commodity contracts or other property promptly after such liquidation or transfer.

      (e) —(1)  With the exception of transfers of customer property made in accordance with § 190.07, the trustee shall make no disbursements to customers except with approval of the court.

      (2)  The trustee shall promptly invest the proceeds from the liquidation of commodity contracts or specifically identifiable property, and may invest any other customer property, in obligations of the United States and obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, provided that such obligations are maintained in a depository located in the United States, its territories or possessions.

      (f)  The trustee shall apply the residual interest provisions of § 1.11 of this chapter in a manner appropriate to the context of their responsibilities as a bankruptcy trustee pursuant subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and this part, and in light of the existence of a surplus or deficit in customer property available to pay customer claims.

      § 190.06   Making and taking delivery under commodity contracts.

#### § § 190.06

      (a) —(1)  The provisions of this paragraph (a) apply to commodity contracts that settle upon expiration or exercise by making or taking delivery of physical delivery property, if such commodity contracts are in a delivery position on the filing date, or the trustee is unable to liquidate such commodity contracts in accordance with § 190.04(c) to prevent them from moving into a delivery position,  before the debtor or its customer incurs bilateral contractual obligations to make or take delivery under such commodity contracts.

      (2)  (i) The trustee shall use reasonable efforts to allow a customer to deliver physical delivery property that is held directly by the customer and not by the debtor (and thus not recorded in any commodity contract account of the customer) in settlement of a commodity contract, and to allow payment in exchange for such delivery, to occur outside the administration of the debtor's estate, when the rules of the exchange or other market listing the commodity contract, or the clearing organization or the foreign clearing organization clearing the commodity contract, as applicable, prescribe a process for delivery that allows the delivery to be fulfilled:

      (A) In the normal course directly by the customer;

      (B) By substitution of the customer for the commodity broker; or

      (C) Through agreement of the buyer and seller to alternative delivery procedures.

      (ii) Where a customer delivers physical delivery property in settlement of a commodity contract outside of the administration of the debtors' estate in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, any property of such customer held at the debtor in connection with such contract must nonetheless be included in the net equity claim of that customer, and, as such, can only be distributed pro rata at the time of, and as part of, any distributions to customers made by the trustee.

      (3)  When the trustee determines that it is not practicable to effect delivery as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:

      (i) To facilitate the making or taking of delivery directly by a customer, the trustee may, as it determines reasonable under the circumstances of the case and consistent with the pro rata distribution of customer property by account class:

      (A) When a customer is obligated to make delivery, return any physical delivery property to the customer that is held by the debtor for or on behalf of the customer under the terms set forth in § 190.09(d)(1)(ii), to allow the customer to deliver such property to fulfill its delivery obligation under the commodity contract; or

      (B) When a customer is obligated to take delivery:

      () Return any cash delivery property to the customer that is reflected in the customer's delivery account, provided that cash delivery property returned under this paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)() shall not exceed the lesser of:

      () The amount the customer _i_s required to pay for delivery of the commodity; or

      () The customer's net funded balance for all of the customer's commodity contract accounts;

      () Return cash, securities, or other property held in the customer's non-delivery commodity contract accounts, provided that property returned under this section shall not exceed the lesser of:

      () The amount the customer _i_s required to pay for delivery of the commodity; or

      () The net funded balance for all of the customer's commodity contract accounts reduced by any amount returned to the customer pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)() of this section, and provided further, however, that the trustee may distribute such property only to the extent that the customer's funded balance for each such account exceeds the minimum margin obligations for such account (as described in § _1_90.04(b)(2)); and

      (C) Impose such conditions on the customer as it considers appropriate to assure that property returned to the customer is used to fulfill the customer's delivery obligations.

      (ii) If the trustee does not return physical delivery property, cash delivery property, or other property in the form of cash or cash equivalents to the customer as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, subject to paragraph (a)(4) of this section:

      (A) To the extent practical, the trustee shall make or take delivery of physical delivery property in the same manner as if no bankruptcy had occurred, and when making delivery, the party to which delivery is made must pay the full price required for taking such delivery; or

      (B) When taking delivery of physical delivery property:

      () The trustee shall pay for the delivery first using the customer's cash delivery property or other property, limited to the amounts set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, along with any cash transferred by the customer to the trustee on or after the filing date for the purpose of paying for delivery.

      () If the value of the cash or cash equivalents that may be used to pay for deliveries as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section is less than the amount required to be paid for taking delivery, the trustee shall issue a payment call to the customer. The full amount of any payment made by the customer in response to a payment call must be credited to the funded balance of the particular account for which such payment is made.

      () If the customer fails to meet a call for payment under paragraph (a)(_3_)(ii)(B)() of this section before payment is made for delivery, the trustee must convert any physical delivery property received on behalf of the customer to cash as promptly as possible.

      (4)  If an open commodity contract held in a futures account, foreign futures account, or cleared swaps account requires delivery of a security upon expiration or exercise of such commodity contract, and delivery is not completed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, the trustee may make or take delivery in a securities account in a manner consistent with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section,  that the trustee may transfer property from the customer's commodity contract accounts to the securities account to fulfill the delivery obligation only to the extent that the customer's funded balance for such commodity contract account exceeds the customer's minimum margin obligations for such accounts (as described in § 190.04(b)(2)) and provided further that the customer is not under-margined or does not have a deficit balance in any other commodity contract accounts.

      (5)  If delivery of physical delivery property is to be made or taken on behalf of the debtor's own account or the account of any non-public customer of the debtor, the trustee shall make or take delivery, as the case may be, on behalf of the debtor's estate, provided that if the trustee takes delivery of physical delivery property it must convert such property to cash as promptly as possible.

      (b)  (1) Within the delivery account class, the trustee shall treat—

      (i) Physical delivery property held in delivery accounts as of the filing date, and the proceeds of any such physical delivery property subsequently received, as part of the physical delivery account class; and

      (ii) Cash delivery property in delivery accounts as of the filing date, along with any physical delivery property for which delivery is subsequently taken on behalf of a customer in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as part of a separate cash delivery account class.

      (2)(i) If the debtor holds any cash or cash equivalents in an account maintained at a bank, clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, or other person, under a name or in a manner that clearly indicates that the account holds property for the purpose of making payment for taking delivery, or receiving payment for making delivery, of a commodity under commodity contracts, such property shall (subject to § 190.09) be considered customer property—

      (A) In the cash delivery account class if held for making payment for taking delivery; and

      (B) In the physical delivery account class, if held as a result of receiving such payment for a making delivery after the filing date.

      (ii) Any other property (excluding property segregated for the benefit of customer in the futures, foreign futures or cleared swaps account class) that is traceable as having been held or received for the purpose of making delivery, or as having been held or received as a result of taking delivery, of a commodity under commodity contracts, shall (subject to § 190.09) be considered customer property—

      (A) In the cash delivery account class if received after the filing date in exchange for taking delivery; and

      (B) Otherwise shall be considered customer property in the physical delivery account class.

      § 190.07   Transfers.

#### § § 190.07

      (a)  No clearing organization or self-regulatory organization may adopt, maintain in effect, or enforce rules that:

      (1) Are inconsistent with the provisions of this part;

      (2) Interfere with the acceptance by its members of transfers of commodity contracts, and the property margining or securing such contracts, from futures commission merchants that are required to transfer accounts pursuant to § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter; or

      (3) Interfere with the acceptance by its members of transfers of commodity contracts, and the property margining or securing such contracts, from a futures commission merchant that is a debtor as defined in § 190.01, if such transfers have been approved by the Commission,  that this paragraph (a)(3) shall not—

      (i) Limit the exercise of any contractual right of a clearing organization or other registered entity to liquidate or transfer open commodity contracts; or

      (ii) Be interpreted to limit a clearing organization's ability adequately to manage risk.

      (b)  (1) It is the duty of each transferee to assure that it will not accept a transfer that would cause the transferee to be in violation of the minimum financial requirements set forth in this chapter.

      (2) Any transferee that accepts a transfer of open commodity contracts from the estate of the debtor—

      (i) Accepts the transfer subject to any loss that may arise in the event the transferee cannot recover from the customer any deficit balance that may arise related to the transferred open commodity contracts.

      (ii) If the commodity contracts were held for the account of a customer:

      (A) Must keep such commodity contracts open at least one business day after their receipt, unless the customer for whom the transfer is made fails to respond within a reasonable time to a margin call for the difference between the margin transferred with such commodity contracts and the margin which such transferee would require with respect to a similar set of commodity contracts held for the account of a customer in the ordinary course of business; and

      (B) May not collect commissions with respect to the transfer of such commodity contracts.

      (3) A transferee may accept open commodity contracts and property, and open accounts on its records, for customers whose commodity contracts and property are transferred pursuant to this part prior to completing customer diligence, provided that account opening diligence as required by law (including the risk disclosures referred to in § 1.65(a)(3) of this chapter) is performed, and records and information required by law are obtained, as soon as practicable, but in any event within six months of the transfer, unless this time is extended for a particular account, transferee, or debtor by the Commission.

      (4)(i) Any account agreements governing a transferred account (including an account that has been partially transferred) shall be deemed assigned to the transferee by operation of law and shall govern the transferee and customer's relationship until such time as the transferee and customer enter into a new agreement;  that any breach of such agreement by the debtor existing at or before the time of the transfer (including, but not limited to, any failure to segregate sufficient customer property) shall not constitute a default or breach of the agreement on the part of the transferee, or constitute a defense to the enforcement of the agreement by the transferee.

      (ii) Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section shall not apply where the customer has a pre-existing account agreement with the transferee futures commission merchant. In such a case, the transferred account will be governed by that pre-existing account agreement.

      (5) If open commodity contracts or any specifically identifiable property has been, or is to be, transferred in accordance with section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and this section, customer instructions previously received by the trustee with respect to open commodity contracts or with respect to specifically identifiable property, shall be transmitted to the transferee of property, which shall comply therewith to the extent practicable.

      (c)  All commodity contract accounts (including accounts with no open commodity contract positions) are eligible for transfer after the order for relief pursuant to section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, except:

      (1) The debtor's own account or the accounts of general partners of the debtor if the debtor is a partnership; and

      (2) Accounts that are in deficit.

      (d) —(1)  The trustee for a commodity broker shall use its best efforts to effect a transfer to one or more other commodity brokers of all eligible commodity contract accounts, open commodity contracts and property held by the debtor for or on behalf of its customers, based on customer claims or record, no later than the seventh calendar day after the order for relief.

      (2) —(i)  If all eligible commodity contract accounts held by a debtor cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer may nonetheless be made. The Commission will not disapprove such a transfer for the sole reason that it was a partial transfer. Commodity contract accounts may be transferred to one or more transferees, and, subject to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, may be transferred to different transferees by account class.

      (ii)  If all of a customer's open commodity contracts and property cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer of contracts and property may be made so long as such transfer would not result in an increase in the amount of any customer's net equity claim. One, but not the only, means to effectuate a partial transfer is by liquidating a portion of the open commodity contracts held by a customer such that sufficient value is realized, or margin requirements are reduced to an extent sufficient, to permit the transfer of some or all of the remaining open commodity contracts and property. If any open commodity contract to be transferred in a partial transfer is part of a spread or straddle, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, each side of such spread or straddle must be transferred or none of the open commodity contracts comprising the spread or straddle may be transferred.

      (3)  A letter of credit received, acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase, or sell a commodity contract may be transferred with an eligible commodity contract account if it is held by a derivatives clearing organization on a pass-through or other basis or is transferable by its terms, so long as the transfer will not result in a recovery which exceeds the amount to which the customer would be entitled under §§ 190.08 and 190.09. If the letter of credit cannot be transferred as provided for in the foregoing sentence, and the customer does not deliver substitute customer property to the trustee in accordance with § 190.04(d)(3), the trustee may draw upon a portion or all of the letter of credit, the proceeds of which shall be treated as customer property in the applicable account class.

      (4)  The trustee shall use reasonable efforts to prevent physical delivery property held for the purpose of making delivery on a commodity contract from being transferred separate and apart from the related commodity contract, or to a different transferee.

      (5)  No transfer shall be made under this part by the trustee if, after taking into account all customer property available for distribution to customers in the applicable account class at the time of the transfer, such transfer would result in insufficient remaining customer property to make an equivalent percentage distribution (including all previous transfers and distributions) to all customers in the applicable account class, based on—

      (i) Customer claims of record; and

      (ii) Estimates of other customer claims made in the trustee's reasonable discretion based on available information, in each case as of the calendar day immediately preceding transfer.

      (e) —(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the following transfers are approved and may not be avoided under sections 544, 546, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code:

      (i) The transfer of commodity contract accounts or customer property prior to the entry of the order for relief in compliance with § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter unless such transfer is disapproved by the Commission;

      (ii) The transfer, withdrawal, or settlement, prior to the order for relief at the request of a public customer, including a transfer, withdrawal, or settlement at the request of a public customer that is a commodity broker, of commodity contract accounts or customer property held from or for the account of such customer by or on behalf of the debtor unless:

      (A) The customer acted in collusion with the debtor or its principals to obtain a greater share of customer property or the bankruptcy estate than that to which it would be entitled under this part; or

      (B) The transfer is disapproved by the Commission;

      (iii) The transfer prior to the order for relief by a clearing organization, or by a receiver that has been appointed for the futures commission merchant (FCM) that is now a debtor, of one or more accounts held for or on behalf of customers of the debtor, or of commodity contracts and other customer property held for or on behalf of customers of the debtor, provided that the transfer is not disapproved by the Commission.

      (2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the following transfers are approved and may not be avoided under sections 544, 546, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code:

      (i) The transfer of a commodity contract account or customer property eligible to be transferred under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section made by the trustee or by any clearing organization on or before the seventh calendar day after the entry of the order for relief, as to which the Commission has not disapproved the transfer; or

      (ii) The transfer of a commodity contract account or customer property at the direction of the Commission on or before the seventh calendar day after the order for relief, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may deem appropriate and in the public interest.

      (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (other than paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(5) of this section), in appropriate cases and to protect the public interest, the Commission may:

      (1) Prohibit the transfer of a particular set or sets of commodity contract accounts and customer property; or

      (2) Permit transfers of a particular set or sets of commodity contract accounts and customer property that do not comply with the requirements of this section.

      § 190.08   Calculation of funded net equity.

#### § § 190.08

      For purposes of this subpart, funded net equity shall be computed as follows:

      (a)  The funded net equity claim of a customer shall be equal to the aggregate of the funded balances of such customer's net equity claim for each account class.

      (b)  Net equity means a customer's total customer claim of record against the estate of the debtor based on the customer property, including any commodity contracts, held by the debtor for or on behalf of such customer less any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor. Net equity shall be calculated as follows:

      (1)  (i) Determine the equity balance of each commodity contract account of a customer by computing, with respect to such account, the sum of:

      (A) The ledger balance;

      (B) The open trade balance; and

      (C) The realizable market value, determined as of the close of the market on the last preceding market day, of any securities or other property held by or for the debtor from or for such account, plus accrued interest, if any.

      (ii) For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the ledger balance of a customer account shall be calculated by:

      (A) Adding:

      () Cash deposited to purchase, margin, guarantee, secure, or settle a commodity contract;

      () Cash proceeds of liquidations of any securities or other property referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section;

      () Gains realized on trades; and

      () The face amount of any letter of credit received, acquired or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase or sell a commodity contract; and

      (B) Subtracting from the result:

      () Losses realized on trades;

      () Disbursements to or on behalf of the customer (including, for these purposes, transfers made pursuant to §§ 190.04(a) and 190.07); and

      () The normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees, insurance, and other costs and charges lawfully incurred in connection with the purchase, sale, exercise, or liquidation of any commodity contract in such account.

      (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the open trade balance of a customer's account shall be computed by subtracting the unrealized loss in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account from the unrealized gain in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account.

      (iv) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), in calculating the ledger balance or open trade balance of any customer, exclude any security futures products, any gains or losses realized on trades in such products, any property received to margin, guarantee, or secure such products (including interest thereon or the proceeds thereof), to the extent any of the foregoing are held in a securities account, and any disbursements to or on behalf of such customer in connection with such products or such property held in a securities account.

      (2)  Aggregate the credit and debit equity balances of all accounts of the same class held by a customer in the same capacity. Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xii) of this section prescribe which accounts must be treated as being held in the same capacity and which accounts must be treated as being held in a separate capacity.

      (i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), all accounts that are maintained with a debtor in a person's name and that, under this paragraph (b)(2), are deemed to be held by that person in its individual capacity shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity.

      (ii) An account maintained with a debtor by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of a ward, or for the benefit of a minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such guardian, custodian or conservator in its individual capacity.

      (iii) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of an executor or administrator of an estate in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such executor or administrator in its individual capacity.

      (iv) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of a decedent, in the name of the decedent's estate, or in the name of the executor or administrator of such estate in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be accounts held in the same capacity.

      (v) An account maintained with a debtor by a trustee shall be deemed to be held in the individual capacity of the grantor of the trust unless the trust is created by a valid written instrument for a purpose other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part. A trust account which is not deemed to be held in the individual capacity of its grantor under this paragraph (b)(2)(v) shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held in an individual capacity by the trustee, by the grantor or any successor in interest of the grantor, or by any trust beneficiary, and from accounts held by any other trust.

      (vi) An account maintained with a debtor by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by the shareholders, partners or members of such corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, if such entity was created for purposes other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part.

      (vii) A hedging account of a person shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as a speculative account of such person.

      (viii) Subject to paragraphs (b)(2)(ix) and (xiv) of this section, the futures accounts, foreign futures accounts, delivery accounts, and cleared swaps accounts of the same person shall not be deemed to be held in separate capacities:  that such accounts may be aggregated only in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (ix) An omnibus customer account for public customers of a futures commission merchant maintained with a debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from any omnibus customer account for non-public customers of such futures commission merchant and from any account maintained with the debtor on its own behalf or on behalf of any non-public customer.

      (x) A joint account maintained with the debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from any account held in an individual capacity by the participants in such account, from any account held in an individual capacity by a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor for such account, and from any other joint account;  that if such account is not transferred in accordance with §§ 190.04(a) and 190.07, it shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any other joint account held by identical participants and a participant's percentage interest therein shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any account held in an individual capacity by such participant.

      (xi) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of a plan that is subject to the terms of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the regulations in 29 CFR chapter XXV, or similar state, Federal, or foreign laws or regulations applicable to retirement or pension plans, shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from an account held in an individual capacity by the plan administrator, any employer, employee, participant, or beneficiary with respect to such plan.

      (xii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an account maintained with a debtor by an agent or nominee for a principal or a beneficial owner shall be deemed to be an account held in the individual capacity of such principal or beneficial owner.

      (xiii) With respect to the cleared swaps account class, each individual cleared swaps customer account within each cleared swap omnibus customer account referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from each other such individual cleared swaps customer account, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section.

      (xiv) Accounts held by a customer in separate capacities shall be deemed to be accounts of different customers. The burden of proving that an account is held in a separate capacity shall be upon the customer.

      (3)  (i) The net equity of one customer account may not be offset against the net equity of any other customer account.

      (ii) Any obligation to the debtor owed by a customer which is not required to be included in computing the equity of that customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (defined as x), must be deducted from any obligation to the customer owed by the debtor which is not required to be included in computing the equity of that customer (defined as y). If the former amount (x) exceeds the latter (y), the excess (x-y) must be deducted from the equity balance of the customer obtained after performing the preceding calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section, provided, that if the customer owns more than one class of accounts with a positive equity balance, the excess (again, x-y) must be allocated and offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances of accounts of different classes held by such customer.

      (iii) A negative equity balance obtained with respect to one customer account class must be set off against a positive equity balance in any other account class of such customer held in the same capacity, provided, that if a customer owns more than one class of accounts with a positive equity balance, such negative equity balance must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances in accounts of different classes held by such customer.

      (iv) To the extent any indebtedness of the debtor to the customer which is not required to be included in computing the equity of such customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds such indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, the customer claim therefor will constitute a general creditor claim rather than a customer property claim, and the net equity therefor shall be separately calculated.

      (v) The rules pertaining to separate capacities and permitted setoffs contained in this section shall only be applied subsequent to the entry of an order for relief; prior to that date, the provisions of § 1.22 of this chapter and of sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(f) of the Act (and, in each case, the regulations in part 1, 22, or 30 of this chapter that implement sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(f)) shall govern what setoffs are permitted.

      (4)  The value on the date of transfer or distribution of any property transferred or distributed subsequent to the filing date and prior to the primary liquidation date with respect to each class of account held by a customer must be added to the equity obtained for that customer for accounts of that class after performing the steps contained in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:  that if all accounts for which there are customer claims of record and 100% of the equity pertaining thereto is transferred in accordance with § 190.07 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, net equity shall be computed based solely upon those allowed customer claims, if any, filed subsequent to the order for relief which are not claims of record on the filing date.

      (5)  Compute any adjustments to the steps in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section required to correct misestimates or errors including, without limitation, corrections for ongoing events such as the liquidation of unliquidated claims or specifically identifiable property at a value different from the estimated value previously used in computing net equity.

      (c)  means a customer's pro rata share of the customer estate with respect to each account class available for distribution to customers of the same customer class.

      (1)  The funded balance of any customer claim shall be computed (separately by account class and customer class) by:

      (i) Multiplying the ratio of the amount of the net equity claim of such customer (defined as x) less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of such customer for any account class (defined as y) divided by the sum of the net equity claims of all customers for accounts of that class (defined as p) less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of all customers for accounts of that class (defined as q) (thus, ((x-y)/(p-q)) by the sum of:

      (A) The value of letters of credit received, acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase, or sell a commodity contract relating to all customer accounts of the same class;

      (B) The value of the money, securities, or other property segregated on behalf of all customer accounts of the same class less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section;

      (C) The value of any money, securities, or other property which must be allocated under § 190.09 to all customer accounts of the same class; and

      (D) The amount of any add-back required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

      (ii) Then adding 100% of—

      (A) Any margin payment made between the entry of the order for relief (or, in an involuntary case, the date on which the petition for bankruptcy is filed) and the primary liquidation date;  that if margin is posted to substitute for a letter of credit, such margin does not increase the funded balance; and

      (B) For cash delivery property, any cash transferred to the trustee on or after the filing date for the purpose of paying for delivery.

      (2)  The funded balance must be adjusted to correct for ongoing events including, without limitation:

      (i) Added claimants;

      (ii) Disallowed claims;

      (iii) Liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value other than their estimated value; and

      (iv) Recovery of property.

      (d)  In computing net equity, commodity contracts and other property held by or for a commodity broker must be valued as provided in this paragraph (d).

      (1) —(i)  Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (d), the value of an open commodity contract shall be equal to the settlement price as calculated by the clearing organization pursuant to its rules;  that if an open commodity contract is transferred to another commodity broker, its value on the debtor's books and records shall be determined as of the end of the last settlement cycle on the day preceding such transfer.

      (ii)  Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, the value of a commodity contract liquidated on the open market shall equal the actual value realized on liquidation of the commodity contract.

      (A)  If identical commodity contracts are liquidated within a 24-hour period or business day (or such other period as the bankruptcy court may determine is appropriate) as part of a general liquidation of commodity contracts, but cannot be liquidated at the same price, the trustee may use the weighted average of the liquidation prices in computing the net equity of each customer for which the debtor held such commodity contracts.

      (B)  The value of a commodity contract liquidated as part of a bulk auction, taken into inventory or under management by a clearing organization, or similarly liquidated outside of the open market shall be equal to the settlement price calculated by the clearing organization as of the end of the settlement cycle during which the commodity contract was liquidated.

      (2)  The value of a listed security shall be equal to the closing price for such security on the exchange upon which it is traded. The value of all securities not traded on an exchange shall be equal in the case of a long position, to the average of the bid prices for long positions, and in the case of a short position, to the average of the asking prices for the short positions. If liquidated, the value of such security shall be equal to the actual value realized on liquidation of the security;  that if identical securities are liquidated within a 24-hour period or business day (or such other period as the bankruptcy court may determine is appropriate) as part of a general liquidation of securities, but cannot be liquidated at the same price, the trustee may use the weighted average of the liquidation prices in computing the net equity of each customer for which the debtor held such securities. Securities which are not publicly traded shall be valued by the trustee pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

      (3)  Commodities held in inventory, as collateral or otherwise, shall be valued at their fair market value. If such fair market value is not readily ascertainable based upon public sources of prices, the trustee shall value such commodities pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

      (4)  The value of any letter of credit received, acquired or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase, or sell a commodity contract shall be its face amount, less the amount, if any, drawn and outstanding, provided that, if the trustee makes a determination in good faith that a draw on a letter of credit is unlikely to be honored on either a temporary or a permanent basis, the trustee shall value the letter of credit pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

      (5)  Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (d), all other property shall be valued by the trustee using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances;  that if such property is sold, its value for purposes of the calculations required by this part shall be equal to the actual value realized on the sale of such property; and, provided further, that the sale shall be made in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules, and orders of any court or governmental entity with jurisdiction there over.

      § 190.09   Allocation of property and allowance of claims.

      (b)  No customer property may be allocated to pay non-public customer claims until all public customer claims have been satisfied in full. Any property segregated on behalf of or attributable to non-public customers must be treated initially as part of the public customer estate and allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (c) —(1) —(i)  Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, property held by or for the account of a customer, which is segregated on behalf of a specific account class, or readily traceable on the filing date to customers of such account class, or recovered by the trustee on behalf of or for the benefit of an account class, must be allocated to the customer estate of the account class for which it is segregated, to which it is readily traceable, or for which it is recovered.

      (ii)  If, after payment in full of all allowed customer claims in a particular account class, any property remains allocated to that account class, such excess shall be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (2)  Money, securities, and property received from or for the account of customers which cannot be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, must be allocated in the following order:

      (i) To the estate of the account class for which, after the allocation required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is the lowest, until the funded percentage of net equity claims of such class equals the percentage of each public customer's net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of the funded claims; and then

      (ii) To the estate of the two account classes referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section so that the percentage of the net equity claims which are funded for each class remains equal until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded equals the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of funded claims, and so forth, until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is equal for all classes of accounts; and then,

      (iii) Among account classes in the same proportion as the public customer net equity claims for each such account class bears to the total of public customer net equity claims of all account classes until the public customer claims of each account class are paid in full; and, thereafter,

      (iv) To the non-public customer estate for each account class in the same order as is prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section for the allocation of the customer estate among account classes.

      (d) —(1)  Specifically identifiable property not required to be liquidated under § 190.04(d)(2) may be returned or transferred on behalf of the customer to which it is identified:

      (i) If it is margining an open commodity contract, only if substitute customer property is first deposited with the trustee with a value equal to the greater of the full fair market value of such property on the return date or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security; or

      (ii) If it is not margining an open commodity contract, at the option of the customer, either pursuant to the terms of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, or pursuant to the following terms: Such customer first deposits substitute customer property with the trustee with a value equal to the amount by which the greater of the value of the specifically identifiable property to be transferred or returned on the date of such transfer or return or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security, together with any other disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account;  that adequate security to assure the recovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.

      (2)  Any open commodity contract that is specifically identifiable property and which is not required to be liquidated under § 190.04(d), and which is not otherwise liquidated, may be transferred on behalf of a public customer,  that such customer must first deposit substitute customer property with the trustee with a value equal to the amount by which the equity to be transferred to margin such contract together with any other transfers or returns of specifically identifiable property or disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account; and, provided further, that adequate security to assure the recovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.

      (3)  If any securities of a customer are specifically identifiable property as defined in paragraph (1)(i)(A) of the definition of that term in § 190.01 of this chapter, but the customer has no open commodity contracts, the customer may request that the trustee purchase or otherwise obtain the largest whole number of like-kind securities ( securities of the same class and series of an issuer), with a fair market value (inclusive of transaction costs) which does not exceed that portion of the funded balance of such customer's allowed net equity claim that constitutes a claim for securities, if like-kind securities can be purchased in a fair and orderly manner.

      (4)  No distribution shall be made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (3) of this section prior to receipt of a completed proof of customer claim as described in § 190.03(e) or (f).

      (5)  No further disbursements may be made to customers with respect to a particular account class for whom transfers have been made pursuant to § 190.07 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, until a percentage of each net equity claim equivalent to the percentage distributed to such customers is distributed to all public customers in such account class. Partial distributions, other than the transfers referred to in § 190.07 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with respect to a particular account class made prior to the final net equity determination date must be made pursuant to a preliminary plan of distribution approved by the court, upon notice to the parties and to all customers, which plan requires adequate security to the debtor's estate to assure the recovery of any overpayments by the trustee and distributes an equal percentage of net equity to all public customers in such account class.

      § 190.17   Calculation of net equity.

#### § § 190.17

      (a)  (1) If a member of the clearing organization clears trades in commodity contracts through a commodity contract account carried by the debtor as a customer account for the benefit of the clearing member's public customers and separately through a house account, the clearing member shall be treated as having customer claims against the debtor in separate capacities with respect to the customer account and house account at the clearing organization, and by account class. A member shall be treated as part of the public customer class with respect to claims based on any commodity customer accounts carried as “customer accounts” by the clearing organization for the benefit of the member's public customers, and as part of the non-public customer class with respect to claims based on its house account.

      (2) Net equity shall be calculated separately for each separate customer capacity in which the clearing member has a claim against the debtor,  separately by the member's customer account and house account and by account class.

      (b)  (1)(i) The calculation of a clearing member's net equity claim shall include the full application of the debtor's loss allocation rules and procedures, including the default rules and procedures referred to in § 39.16 and, if applicable, § 39.35 of this chapter.

      (ii) The calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will include, with respect to the clearing member's house account, any assessments or similar loss allocation arrangements provided for under those rules and procedures that were not called for before the filing date, or, if called for, have not been paid. Such loss allocation arrangements shall be applied to the extent necessary to address losses arising from default by clearing members.

      (2) Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the net equity claims of the clearing members that are so entitled under the following circumstances: Where the debtor's loss allocation rules and procedures would entitle clearing members to additional payments of cash or other property due to—

      (i) Portions of mutualized default resources that are prefunded, or assessed and collected, but in either event not used; or

      (ii) The debtor's recoveries on claims against others (including, but not limited to, recoveries on claims against clearing members who have defaulted on their obligations to the debtor).

      (c)  Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, net equity shall be calculated in the manner provided in § 190.08, to the extent applicable.

      (d)  means a clearing member's pro rata share of customer property other than member property (for accounts for a clearing member's customer accounts) or member property (for a clearing member's house accounts) with respect to each account class available for distribution to customers of the same customer class, calculated in the manner provided in § 190.08(c) to the extent applicable.

      (2) Customer property will not include property of the type described in § 190.09(a)(2), as if the term debtor used therein refers to a clearing organization and to the extent relevant to a clearing organization.

      (c)  (1) Where the funded balance for members' house accounts is greater than one hundred percent with respect to any account class:

      (i) Any excess should be allocated to customer property other than member property to the extent that the funded balance is less than one hundred percent of net equity claims for members' public customers in any account class; and

      (ii) Any remaining excess after the application of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section should be allocated to member property to the extent that the funded balance is less than one hundred percent of net equity claims for members' house accounts in any other account class.

      (2)  Customer property which cannot be allocated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be allocated within customer classes, but between account classes, in the following order:

      (i) To the estate of the account class for which the percentage of each members' net equity claim which is funded is the lowest, until the funded percentage of net equity claims of such account class equals the percentage of each members' net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of the funded claims; and then

      (ii) To the estate of the two account classes so that the percentage of the net equity claims which are funded for each such account class remains equal until the percentage of each net equity claim which is funded equals the percentage of each net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of funded claims, and so forth, until all account classes within the customer class are fully funded.

      (e)  Where the debtor has, prior to the order for relief, kept initial margin for house accounts in accounts without separation by account class, then member property will be considered to be in a single account class.

      (f)  Nothing in this section, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of customer claims by operation of this section, shall prevent a trustee from asserting claims against any person to recover the shortfall of property enumerated in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(E) and (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      § 190.19   Support of daily settlement.

#### § § 190.19

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, funds received (whether from clearing members' house or customer accounts) by a debtor clearing organization as part of the daily settlement required pursuant to § 39.14 of this chapter shall, upon and after an order for relief, be included as customer property that is reserved for and traceable to, and promptly shall be distributed to, members entitled to payments of such funds with respect to such members' house and customer accounts as part of that same daily settlement. Such funds when received, other than deposits of initial margin described in § 39.14(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter, shall be considered member property and, separately, customer property other than member property, in proportion to the ratio of total gains in member accounts with net gains, and total gains in clearing members' customer accounts with net gains, respectively. Deposits of initial margin described in § 39.14(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter shall be considered member property and, separately, customer property other than member property, to the extent deposited on behalf of, respectively, clearing members' house accounts and customer accounts.

      (b) To the extent there is a shortfall in funds received pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) Such funds shall be supplemented with the property described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable, to the extent necessary to meet the shortfall, in accordance with the derivatives clearing organization's default rules and procedures adopted pursuant to § 39.16 and, as applicable, § 39.35 of this chapter, and (with respect to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) any recovery and wind-down plans maintained pursuant to § 39.39 of this chapter and submitted pursuant to § 39.19 of this chapter. Such funds shall be included as member property and customer property other than member property in the proportion described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall be distributed promptly to members' house accounts and members' customer accounts which accounts are entitled to payment of such funds as part of that daily settlement.

      (i) Initial margin held for the account of a member, including initial margin segregated for the customers of such member, that has defaulted on payments required pursuant to a daily settlement, but only to the extent that such margin is permitted to be used pursuant to parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter.

      (ii) Assets of the debtor, to the extent dedicated to such use as part of the debtor's default rules and procedures, and any recovery and wind-down plans, described in this paragraph (b)(1).

      (iii) Prefunded guarantee or default funds maintained pursuant to the debtor's default rules and procedures.

      (iv) Payments made by members pursuant to assessment powers maintained pursuant to the debtor's default rules and procedures.

      (2) If the funds that are included as customer property pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, supplemented as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are insufficient to pay in full members entitled to payment of such funds as part of daily settlement, then such funds shall be distributed pro rata to such members' house accounts and customer accounts in proportion to the ratio of total gains in member accounts with net gains, and total gains in customer accounts with net gains, respectively.
