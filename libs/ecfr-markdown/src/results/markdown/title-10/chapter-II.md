      (1) Has sufficient inherent design characteristics to permit the addition of equipment (including all necessary pollution devices) necessary to render such electric powerplant capable of using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source; and

      (2) Is not physically, structurally, or technologically precluded from using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source.

      Capability to use coal or another alternate fuel shall not be interpreted to require any such powerplant to be immediately able to use coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source on its initial day of operation. In addition, the owner or operator of a baseload powerplant need not have adequate on-site space for either a coal gasifier or any facilities for handling coal or related fuels.

      means a document, signed by an official of the owner or operator, notarized, and submitted to OFE, which declares that a new powerplant will have the “capability to use alternate fuel” (as defined herein).

      means an existing powerplant whose owner or operator seeks to obtain a prohibition order against the use of natural gas or petroleum either totally or in a mixture with coal or an alternate fuel by filing a certification as to both the technical capability and financial feasibility of conversion to coal or another alternate fuel pursuant to section 301 of FUA, as amended.

      means the _Clean Air Act_, 42 U.S.C. 7401  (1970), as amended by Public Law 93-319, 88 Stat. 246, and Public Law 95-91, 91 Stat. 685.

      means anthracite, bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, lignite, and any fuel derivative thereof.

      means an electric powerplant that produces:

      (1) Electric power; and

      (2) Any other form of useful energy (such as steam, gas or heat) that is, or will be used, for industrial, commercial, or space heating purposes. In addition, for purposes of this definition, electricity generated by the cogeneration facility must constitute more than five (5) percent and less than ninety (90) percent of the useful energy output of the facility.

      means an electric power generating unit that consists of a combination of one or more combustion turbine units and one or more steam turbine units with a substantial portion of the required energy input of the steam turbine unit(s) provided by the exhaust gas from the combustion turbine unit(s).

      Substantial amounts of supplemental firing for a steam turbine or waste heat boiler to improve thermal efficiency will not affect a unit's classification as a combined cycle unit.

      means a unit that is a rotary engine driven by a gas under pressure that is created by the combustion of any fuel.

      as used in the definitions of “alternate fuel,” “natural gas” and “petroleum” shall be determined as follows:

      (1) A waste by-product of industrial or refinery operations is commercially unmarketable by reason of:

      (i) Quality, where the cost of processing (limited to upgrading the waste by-product to commercial quality), storing, and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale;

      (ii) Quantity, where the cost of aggregating the waste by-product into commercial quantities through storing and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale.

      (2) A fuel will not be classified as “natural gas” when it is commercially unmarketable by reason of:

      (i) Quality, where the cost of producing, upgrading to commercial quality, storing, and distributing the fuel would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale; or

      (ii) Quantity, where the quantities of the fuel are so small that the revenues to be reasonably expected from its sale would not cover the cost of its production, distribution or storage.

      (3) Costs associated with upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating a by-product or other fuel (to determine if such fuel is natural gas) may properly include a reasonable rate of return on any capital investment required to overcome the problems posed by the quality or quantity of a fuel because the return on investment is a normal aspect of any investment decision. A firm may account for this reasonable rate of return by using its customary discount rate for an investment of similar risk.

      (4) As part of any consideration of the rate of return on investment, the cost of replacing the Btu's lost if the by-product or other fuel were upgraded and sold instead of used as a fuel may be taken into consideration. The actual expense that would result from burning a replacement fuel in lieu of the by-product or other fuel in question may therefore be considered. The costs associated with using a replacement fuel are indirect costs that result from upgrading and selling the fuel, instead of burning it. These indirect costs as well as the direct costs associated with the upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating of by-products or other fuel may be considered in any assessment of commercial unmarketability.

      means an informal meeting incident to any proceeding, between DOE and any interested person.

      means substantial physical activity at the unit site and includes more than clearance of a site or installation of foundation pilings.

      means total costs, both operating and capital, incurred over the estimated remaining useful life of an electric powerplant, discounted to the present, pursuant to rules established in parts 503 and 504 of these regulations.

(The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)

      (2)  The design fuel heat input rate of a combustion turbine (Btu/hr) shall be the product of its nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the combustion turbine-generator unit's design efficiency (decimal), adjusted for peaking service at an ambient temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) at the unit's elevation. (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)

      (3)  The design fuel heat input rate of a combined cycle unit (Btu/hr) shall be the summation of the product of its generator's nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the overall combustion turbine-generator unit's efficiency (decimal), adjusted for peaking service at an ambient temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) and at the unit's evaluation, plus the product of the maximum fuel heat input to any supplemental heat recovery steam generator/boiler in gallons or pounds per hour and the fuel's heat content. If the generator's nameplate does not have a rating measured in kilowatts, the product of the generator's kilowatt-amperes nameplate rating and power factor nameplate rating must be substituted for kilowatts. (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)

        (4)  In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by FUA, these regulations or by an order, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.

        (5)  Whenever a person is required to perform an act, to cease and desist therefrom, or to initiate a proceeding under this part within a prescribed period of time and the order, notice, interpretation or other document is served by mail, three (3) days shall be added to the prescribed period.

        (7)  All applications, petitions, requests, comments, and other documents that are required to be signed, shall be signed by the person filing the document or a duly authorized representative. Any application, petition, request, complaint, or other document filed by a duly authorized representative shall contain a statement by such person certifying that he is a duly authorized representative, unless an OFE form otherwise requires.

        (8)  An application, petition, or other request for action by DOE or OFE should be clearly labeled according to the nature of the action involved, e.g., “Petition for Temporary Exemption;” “Petition for Extension (or Renewal) of Temporary Exemption,” both on the document and on the outside of the envelope in which the document is transmitted.

        (9)  A person who files an application, petition, complaint, or other request for action is under a continuing obligation during the proceeding to provide DOE or OFE with any new or newly discovered information that is relevant to that proceeding. Such information includes, but is not limited to, information regarding any other application, petition, complaint, or request for action that is subsequently filed by that person with any DOE office or OFE office.

        (10)  In filing a petition or other document requesting OFE action, the person must state whether, to the best of his knowledge, the same or a related issue, act or transaction has been or presently is being considered or investigated by a DOE office, other Federal agency, department or instrumentality, or a State or municipal agency.

If the person states that the information comes within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information, such person shall include a statement specifying why such information is privileged or confidential. If a document is not so filed, OFE may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety, unless the person subsequently files a claim of confidentiality prior to public disclosure of the document.

        (ii) DOE or OFE retains the right to make its own determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of the decision by DOE or OFE to deny such claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond or take other appropriate action to avoid release shall be given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than seven (7) days prior to its public disclosure.

        (iii) The above provisions in paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to information submitted on OFE forms that contain their own instructions concerning the treatment of confidential information.

        (12)  Each application, petition, or request for DOE or OFE action shall be submitted as a separate document, even if the applications, petitions, or requests deal with the same or a related issue, act, or transaction, or are submitted in connection with the same proceeding.

A proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period which follows publication of the Tentative Staff Analysis or prior to the close of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of the three-month period may be granted at OFE's discretion.

        (4) Subsequent to the end of the comment period, OFE will issue a notice of whether OFE intends to proceed with the prohibition order proceeding.

        (5) An owner or operator of a facility that may be subject to an order may demonstrate prior to issuance of a final prohibition order that the facility would qualify for an exemption if the prohibition had been established by rule. OFE will not delay the issuance of a final prohibition order or stay the effective date of such an order for the purpose of determining whether a proposed order recipient qualifies for a particular exemption unless the demonstration or qualification is submitted prior to or during the second three-month comment period, commencing after issuance of a notice of intention to proceed, or unless materials submitted after the period (i) could not have been submitted during the period through the exercise of due diligence, (ii) address material changes in fact or law occurring after the close of the period, or (iii) consist of amplification or rebuttal occasioned by the subsequent course of the proceeding. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of this time period may be granted at OFE's discretion.

        (6) Subsequent to the end of the second three (3) month period, OFE will, if it intends to issue a final prohibition order, prepare and issue a Notice of Availability of a Tentative Staff Analysis. Interested persons wishing a hearing must request a hearing within forty-five (45) day after issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Tentative Staff Analysis. During this forty-five (45) days period, interested persons may also submit written comments on the Tentative Staff Analysis.

        (7) If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The hearing will consider the findings which OFE must make in order to issue a final prohibition order and any exemption for which the proposed order recipient submitted its demonstration in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (8) Upon request by the recipient of the proposed prohibition order, the combined public comment periods provided for in this section may be reduced to a minimum of forty-five (45) days from the time of publication of the proposed order.

        (9) OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time prior to the date upon which a final order shall become effective. Should OFE terminate the proceeding, it will notify the proposed order recipient, and publish a notice in the

        (c)  (1) OFE will base its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.

        (2) OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the pertinent facts, a statement of the basis upon which the final order is issued, a recitation of the conclusions regarding the required findings and qualifications for exemptions. The final order shall state the effective date of the prohibition contained therein. If it is demonstrated that the facility would have been granted a temporary exemption, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order shall be delayed until such time as the temporary exemption would have terminated. If it is demonstrated that a facility will need a period of time to comply with the final order, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order may be delayed, in OFE's discretion, so as to allow an order recipient to comply with the final order.

        (3) OFE will enclose with a copy of the final order, where appropriate, a schedule of steps that should be taken by a stated date (a compliance schedule) to ensure that the affected facility will be able to comply with the prohibitions stated in the order by the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order. The compliance schedule may require the affected person to take steps with regard to a unit 60 days after service of the final order.

        (a) OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency in an existing powerplant if the owner or operator of the powerplant certifies, and OFE concurs in such certification in accordance with the requirements of §§ 504.5, 504.6 and 504.8.

        (b)  (1) OFE may hold a conference with the proposed order recipient, at the recipient's election, prior to issuing the proposed order. The conference may resolve any questions regarding the certification required by section 301 of the Act, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, and OFE's review and concurrence therein.

        (2) Pursuant to section 701(b) of FUA, prior to the issuance of a final order to a certifying powerplant owner or operator, OFE must publish in the  a proposed prohibition order stating the reasons for such order. OFE will review all of the information submitted by a proposed order recipient within 60 days after receipt by OFE. If the certification is complete, OFE will, within 30 days after the end of the 60 day review period, publish in the  a Notice of Acceptance of certification together with a proposed prohibition order stating therein the reasons for such order. This commences the prohibition order proceeding. If OFE does not believe it is able to concur in the certification, OFE shall notify the proposed order recipient and shall publish a Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence in the  within 30 days after the end of the 60 day review period. If OFE finds that the certification with compliance schedule is incomplete, OFE will notify the proposed prohibition order recipient as to the deficiencies, and provide an additional period of 30 days for the certification to be amended and resubmitted. If a complete certification is not submitted within this period, the proceeding shall be terminated in accordance with § 501.52(b)(5). OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and other parties to the proceeding of the termination and publish a notice in the  OFE, on its own motion, may extend any period of time by publishing a notice to that effect in the

        (3) The publication of the Notice of Acceptance or Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence commences a period of 45 days during which interested persons may submit written comments or request a public hearing. During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any other interested person may submit any evidence that they have available relating to the proposed order, the certification or the concurrence that OFE must make. A proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period which follows the commencement of the proceeding or prior to the close of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request for an extension of the 45 day period may be granted at OFE's discretion. In the case of a Notice of Acceptance, as set forth in § 504.9, no final prohibition order can be issued until any necessary environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C 4321  (NEPA) has been completed. Upon completion of the NEPA review and unless OFE determines on the basis of the record of the proceeding that the certification fails to meet the requirements of §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, OFE shall publish a final prohibition order, together with the information required by paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of a Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence, at the end of the 45 day comment period, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and publish a final Notice of Non-Concurrence in the  if OFE determines it cannot concur in the certification based upon additional information submitted during the proceeding. If, at the end of the 45 day period, OFE believes it can concur in the certification, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and publish a Notice of Acceptance followed by a new 45 day comment period.

        (4) If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The hearing may consider, among other matters, the sufficiency of the certification of the owner or operator of the powerplant required by section 301 of FUA, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations.

        (5) OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time prior to the date upon which a final prohibition order is issued whenever OFE believes, from any information contained in the record of the proceeding, that the certification does not meet the requirements of section 301 of the Act, as amended, or §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations. If OFE terminates the proceeding or publishes a final Notice of Non-Concurrence, or the proposed order recipient fails to submit a complete certification, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and other parties to the proceeding and publish a notice in the  In such event, the proposed order recipient may submit a new certification under any provision of section 301 of the Act, as amended, at a later date. Specifically, a Notice of Non-Concurrence under either section 301(b) or 301(c) shall not affect a proposed order recipient's ability to make a certification under the other subsection.

        (c)  (1) OFE will base its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.

        (2) OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the basis upon which the final order is issued, and its concurrence in the required certification. A copy of the final order and a summary of the basis therefor will be published in the  While the prohibition order is final for purposes of judicial review under section 702 of FUA, the prohibitions contained in the final order shall not become effective for purposes of amendment under section 301(d) of FUA, as amended, and § 501.52(d) of these regulations until the effective date of the prohibitions stated in the order, or, where the order is subject to one or more conditions subsequent listed in the prohibition order compliance schedule, until all its conditions are met.

        (d)  The proposed prohibition order recipient may amend its compliance schedule under § 504.5(d), or its certification under section 301 of FUA, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6 and 504.8 of these regulations in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances at any time prior to the effective date of the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order.

        (e)  The rescission or modification of final prohibition orders issued to existing electric powerplants will be governed by the procedure in § 501.101 of these regulations.

        (f) A request for modification or rescission of a rule or order must contain a complete statement of all facts relevant to the action sought. The request must also include the names and addresses of all reasonably ascertainable persons who will be affected. Pertinent provisions contained in any documents believed to support a request may be briefly described, however, OFE reserves the right to obtain copies of any significant documents that will assist in making a determination on the merits of a request. The request must identify the specific order or rule for which modification or rescission is sought. A request should also indicate whether an informal conference will facilitate OFE's determination to commence, or not to commence a proceeding, or will assist OFE in making any determinations on material issues raised by the request.

        (g) A decision by OFE to commence a proceeding under this subpart does not entitle the requester to a public hearing on the request for modification or rescission. A public hearing may be held, however, if, in its discretion, OFE considers that a public hearing will advance its evaluation of the request.

        § 501.102   OFE evaluation of the record, decision and order for modification or rescission of a rule or order.

#### § § 501.102

        (a) OFE will consider the entire administrative record in its evaluation of the decision and order for modification or rescission of a rule or order. OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in the petition or related documents and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by its investigations. OFE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to any request under this subpart and all interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions. OFE may, in its discretion and on its own initiative, convene a conference, if it considers that a conference will advance its evaluation of the request.

        (b)  Except where modification or rescission of a rule or order is initiated by OFE, OFE's decision to rescind or modify a rule or order will be based on a determination that there are significantly changed circumstances with respect to the applicability of a particular prohibition or exemption to the requester. OFE believes that there may be “significantly changed circumstances”, if:

        (1) Significant material facts are subsequently discovered which were not known and could not have been known to the petitioner or to OFE at the time of the original proceeding;

        (2) A law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal that was in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the rule or order is based and which, if it had been made known to OFE, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome is subsequently discovered; or

        (3) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order was based, which change occurred during the interval between issuance of the order and the date of filing of the request under this subpart, and was caused by force or circumstances beyond the requester's control.

        § 501.103   OFE decision.

#### § § 501.103

        (a) OFE shall issue an appropriate rule or order after considering the request for modification or rescission of a rule or order and other relevant information received during the proceeding.

        (b) OFE will either grant or deny the request for modification or rescission and will briefly state the pertinent facts and legal basis for the decision.

        (c) OFE will serve the rule or order granting or denying the request for modification or rescission upon the requester, or, if the action was initiated by OFE, upon the owner or operator of the affected powerplant or installation. OFE will publish a notice of the issuance of a rule or order modifying or rescinding a rule or order in the

#### § § 501.120

        (a) This subpart sets forth the procedures for the request and issuance of a stay of a rule or order or other requirement issued or imposed by OFE or these regulations but does not apply to the mandatory stays provided for in sections 202(b) and 301(a) of FUA. The application for a stay under this subpart will only be considered incidental to a proceeding on a request for modification or rescission of a final prohibition rule or order.

        (b) The petitioner must comply with all final and effective OFE orders, regulations, rulings, and generally applicable requirements unless a petition for a stay is granted or is applicable under FUA.

        § 501.122   Contents.

#### § § 501.122

        (a) A petition for a stay shall contain a full and complete statement of all facts believed to be pertinent to the act or transaction for which a stay is sought. The facts shall include, but not be limited to, the criteria listed below in § 501.123(b).

        (b) The petitioner may request a conference regarding the application. If the request is not made at the time the application is filed, it must be made as soon thereafter as possible. The request and OFE's determination regarding it will be made in accordance with subpart C of this part.

        § 501.123   Evaluation of the record.

#### § § 501.123

        (a) The record in a proceeding on a petition for stay shall consist of the petition and any related documents, evidence submitted at any public proceedings and any other information in the possession of OFE and made part of the record. OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in the petition or any other document submitted to it and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by its investigations. OFE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to the petition for stay or other document and any interested person will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions. OFE, on its initiative, may convene a conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that the conference will advance its evaluation of the petition.

        (b)  (1) OFE may grant a stay incident to a proceeding on a petition for modification of a rule or order if the petitioner shows:

        (i) Irreparable injury will result if the stay is denied;

        (ii) There is a strong likelihood of success on the merits;

        (iii) The denial of a stay will result in a more immediate hardship or inequity to the petitioner than to other persons affected by the proceeding; and

        (iv) It would be desirable for reasons of public policy to grant the stay.

        § 501.124   Decision and order.

#### § § 501.124

        (a) OFE will issue an order granting or denying the petition for a stay upon consideration of the request and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding.

        (b) OFE will include in the order a brief written statement setting forth the relevant facts and the basis of the decision, including any appropriate terms and conditions of the stay.

      Subpart I—Requests for Interpretation

        § 501.130   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 501.130

        This subpart establishes procedures for filing a formal request for and the issuance of an interpretation of a rule, order or other action by DOE. Any response, whether oral or written, to a general inquiry, or to other than a formal written request for interpretation filed with DOE, is not an interpretation and merely provides general information that may not be relied upon in any proceeding to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of FUA.

        § 501.131   Filing a request for interpretation.

#### § § 501.131

        A proceeding to request an interpretation is commenced by the filing of a “Request for Interpretation (FUA).” The request must be in writing and must also comply with the general filing requirements stated in § 501.7. Any claims for confidential treatment for any information contained in the request or other related documents must be made pursuant to § 501.7(a)(11). A request for interpretation should be filed with the Assistant General Counsel for Interpretations and Rulings at the address provided in § 501.11.

        § 501.132   Contents of a request for interpretation.

#### § § 501.132

        (a) A request for an interpretation must contain a complete statement of all the facts believed to be relevant to the circumstances, acts or transactions that are the subject of the request. The facts must include the names and addresses of all potentially affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any documents submitted with the request. Copies of relevant contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relating to the request must be submitted if DOE believes they are necessary for determination of any issue pending in the proceeding under this subpart. When the request pertains to only one step in a larger integrated transaction, the requesting party must also submit the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction.

        (b) The requesting party must include in the request a discussion of all relevant legal authorities, rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought.

        (c) DOE may refuse to issue an interpretation if it determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base an interpretation.

        § 501.133   DOE evaluation.

#### § § 501.133

        (a)(1) The record shall consist of the request for an interpretation and any supporting documents, all relevant evidence presented at any public proceedings, written comments and any information in the possession of DOE that has been made part of the record.

        (2) DOE may investigate and corroborate any statement in a request or related documents and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by the investigation. DOE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to the request for interpretation, or any other document submitted under this subpart, and the person requesting the interpretation will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions.

        (3) The General Counsel or his delegate will issue an interpretation on the basis of the information provided in the request, unless that information is supplemented by other information brought to the attention of DOE during the proceeding. DOE's interpretation will, therefore, depend on the accuracy of the factual statements, and the requesting party may rely upon it only to the extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon which the interpretation is based.

        (b)  (1) DOE will base its FUA interpretations on the DEOA and FUA, as applicable, and the regulations and published rulings of DOE as applied to the specific factual situation presented.

        (2) DOE will take into consideration previously issued interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.

        § 501.134   Issuance and effect of interpretations.

#### § § 501.134

        (a) DOE may issue an interpretation after consideration of the request for interpretation and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding.

        (b) The interpretation will contain a written statement of the information upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the situation presented in the request.

        (c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically addressed, and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act, are entitled to rely upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in title VII of FUA for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.

        (d) DOE may at any time rescind or modify an interpretation on its own initiative. Rescission or modification shall be made by notifying persons entitled to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This notification will include a statement of the reasons for the rescission or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the interpretation as modified.

        (e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the regulations or ruling to the extent that it is inconsistent with the amended regulation or ruling.

        (f) Any person who believes he is directly affected by an interpretation issued by DOE, and who believes that he will be aggrieved by its implementation, may submit a petition for reconsideration of that interpretation to the General Counsel. DOE will acknowledge receipt of all requests for reconsideration; however, this acknowledgement in no way binds DOE to commence any proceeding on the request. If within sixty (60) days of DOE's acknowledgement of the receipt of a request for reconsideration, DOE has not issued either a notice of intent to commence a proceeding to reconsider the interpretation or a modification, revision or rescission of the original interpretation, the request for reconsideration will be deemed denied. DOE may, in its discretion, issue a formal denial of a request for reconsideration if:

        (1) The request has not been filed in a timely manner, and good cause therefor has not been shown;

        (2) The person requesting reconsideration is not aggrieved or otherwise injured substantially by the interpretation; or

        (3) The request is defective because it fails to state and to present facts and legal argument that the interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary or capricious.

      Subpart J—Rulings

        § 501.140   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 501.140

        DOE may issue rulings in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. DOE will publish each ruling in the  and in 10 CFR part 518. A person is entitled to rely upon a ruling to the extent provided in this subpart.

        § 501.141   Criteria for issuance.

#### § § 501.141

        (a) The General Counsel may issue a ruling whenever:

        (1) There has been a substantial number of inquiries with regard to similar factual situations or a particular section of the regulations; or

        (2) It is determined that a ruling will be of assistance to the public in applying the regulations to a specific situation.

        § 501.142   Modification or rescission.

#### § § 501.142

        (a) A ruling may be modified or rescinded by—

        (1) Publication of the modification or rescission by DOE in the  and in 10 CFR part 518; or

        (2) Adoption of a rule that supersedes or modifies a prior ruling.

        (b) A person shall not be subject to the sanctions or penalties stated in these regulations for actions taken in reliance upon a ruling, notwithstanding that the ruling is subsequently declared to be invalid or no longer applicable. A person affected by a ruling may not rely upon it for more than 30 days after it has been rendered invalid pursuant to issuance of a superseding rule by OFE, or after it has been rescinded or modified by DOE.

        § 501.143   Comments.

#### § § 501.143

        Any interested person may file a written comment on or objection to a published ruling at any time with the Assistant General Counsel for Interpretations and Rulings at the address provided in § 501.11.

#### § § 501.163

        (a) The record shall consist of the complaint and any supporting documents and all other relevant information developed in the course of any investigations or proceedings related to that complaint. OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in the complaint or related documents submitted, and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation or from any other source of information.

        (b)  OFE will treat as confidential information received in any investigation of a complaint, including the identity of the complainant and the identity of any other persons who provide information to the extent such information is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. OFE reserves the right to make disclosures that would be in the public interest.

        § 501.164   Decision to initiate enforcement proceedings.

#### § § 501.164

        After investigation of a specific complaint or based on any relevant information received or obtained during an investigation, OFE may issue a notice of violation, determine that no violation has occurred, or take such other actions as it deems appropriate. Prior to issuance of a notice of violation, and before commencement of an enforcement proceeding, OFE may transmit a draft of the notice of violation to the potentially affected person in order to promote an informal resolution of the violation.

        § 501.165   Commencement of enforcement proceedings.

#### § § 501.165

        (a) Whenever, on the basis of any information available, OFE determines that a person is in violation or about to be in violation of any provision of these regulations, OFE may issue a notice of violation stating, in writing and with reasonable specificity, the nature of the violation. An enforcement proceeding commences with the issuance of a notice of violation.

        (b)  OFE will set forth in the notice of violation the nature of the violation, the relevant facts that OFE believes establish the violation and the legal basis for the conclusions reached therein. OFE may also include with the notice of violation a copy of a proposed order. The notice of violation will also state whether or not OFE proposes to assess civil penalties.

        (1) If OFE proposes to assess a civil penalty, a notice of violation will be issued to the violator with an opportunity for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, as set forth in § 501.166(a)(1) of this part, before any final determination on the violation and penalty are made by OFE. The recipient of the notice will also be informed of his right to elect to have the procedures of § 501.166(a)(2) apply, in lieu of the hearing, with respect to a final determination on the assessment of any civil penalty.

        (2) If OFE does not propose to assess a civil penalty, the violator will be provided the opportunity for a conference, as set forth in § 501.166(b), before a final determination on the violation is made by OFE. OFE may, in its discretion, also provide the violator an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to § 501.166(a)(1).

        (c)  OFE will serve the notice of violation in accordance with provisions set forth in § 501.6.

        (d)  If, after issuance of a notice of violation and any related investigation, OFE finds no basis for the belief that a violation has occurred, is continuing to occur, or is about to occur, OFE may rescind the notice of violation by giving written notice to that effect to the recipient.

        § 501.166   Hearings and conferences.

#### § § 501.166

        (a) —(1)  Unless the recipient of a notice of violation elects in writing to have the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply, OFE will commence a proceeding to assess a penalty and, prior to a final determination on the violation and assessment of a penalty, provide an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554 before an Administrative Law Judge.

        (2)  The recipient of a notice of violation in which a civil penalty assessment has been proposed may elect, in writing, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice, to waive the administrative proceedings described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. OFE will make a determination on the proposed civil penalty assessment and issue a final order to that effect within forty-five (45) days after receiving notice of the exercise of this election.

        (b)  If a person has received a notice of violation in which a civil penalty has not been proposed, he may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, request a conference with OFE to discuss the notice. In order to request a conference he must comply with the instructions set forth in the notice.

        § 501.167   Fuel use order.

#### § § 501.167

        (a)  OFE will issue a Fuel Use Order if, after considering all the information received during the proceeding, OFE determines that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a violation of FUA or of an order or rule thereunder.

        (b)  Any Fuel Use Order issued under this section shall set forth the relevant facts and legal basis for the order and where appropriate, the final penalty assessment and the basis therefor. When an administrative hearing is requested under § 501.166(a) of this part, the Fuel Use Order will include the recommended findings and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the basis for the penalty assessment. OFE will make a final determination as to any penalty assessment or other appropriate remedy based upon the recommended findings and conclusions of the ALJ and other information in the record of the enforcement proceeding. The order will be effective upon service, unless otherwise provided therein, or stayed pursuant to § 501.120.

        (c)  OFE will serve a copy of the Fuel Use Order upon any person who was served a copy of the notice of violation and upon all parties to any public proceeding on the notice of violation. OFE will place a copy of each final order on file in the Public Information Office described in § 501.12.

        (d)  Any person against whom a penalty is assessed pursuant to § 501.167(b) after a hearing before an ALJ may, within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of issuance of the order assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with the provisions of section 723 of FUA.

        (b) Any duly authorized representative of OFE has the authority to conduct an investigation and to take such action as he deems necessary and appropriate to the conduct of the investigation.

        (c)  If any person is required to furnish information or documentary evidence pursuant to a subpoena or special report order, OFE will, upon written request, inform that person as to the general purposes of the investigation.

        (d)  OFE shall not disclose any information received during an investigation under this section, including the identities of the person investigated and any other person who provides information, to the extent it is exempt from public disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 and 10 CFR part 1004.

        (2) OFE may compromise and settle, and collect civil penalties whenever it considers it to be appropriate or advisable.

        (d)  (1) If a director, officer, or agent of a corporation willfully authorizes, orders, or performs any act or practice constituting in whole or in part a violation of the Act, or any rule or order thereunder, he will be subject to the penalties specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section without regard to any penalties to which the corporation may be subject.

        (a) In the event of the occurrence or imminent occurrence of an emergency, or of the occurrence or imminent occurrence of an unanticipated equipment outage in the unit, an owner or operator of a powerplant is automatically permitted to use minimum amounts of natural gas or petroleum in the unit or in a substitute unit to prevent or alleviate the outage or to prevent or alleviate the emergency if he complies with procedures contained in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) If the use of minimum amounts of petroleum or natural gas is required for purposes specified in this section, the owner or operator must notify OFE of such use by telegram or telephone within 24 hours after the commencement of such use. Immediately thereafter a written confirmation must be submitted to OFE, describing, to the best estimate of the owner or operator, (1) the nature of the emergency and (2) how long petroleum or natural gas use is likely to be required.

        (c) For purposes of this section only:

        (1) An  is the occurrence or threat of imminent occurrence of a condition which results or would result from an electric power outage and directly effects or would directly effect the public health, safety or welfare;

        (2)  shall mean an unexpected outage due to equipment failure.

        (3)  shall mean:

        (i) For powerplants, the amounts of natural gas or petroleum required to prevent curtailment of electric supply where the operating utility has, to the maximum extent possible, utilized alternate fuel-fired capacity to prevent such curtailment. Note—A utility operating hydroelectric facilities may take into account seasonal fluctuations in storage capacity and shall be permitted to prevent depletion of stored power-producing capacity as deemed necessary by the utility; and

        (ii) For installations, the amounts of natural gas or petroleum required to meet plant protection or human health and safety needs, including services to hospitals, public transportation facilities, sanitation, or water supply and pumping.

      Subpart B—General Requirements for Exemptions

        § 503.4   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 503.4

        This subpart establishes the general requirements necessary to qualify for either a temporary or permanent exemption under this part and sets out the methodology for calculating the cost of using an alternate fuel and the cost of using imported petroleum.

        § 503.5   Contents of petition.

#### § § 503.5

        Before OFE will accept a petition for either a temporary or permanent exemption under this part, the petition must include all of the evidence and information required in this part and part 501 of this chapter.

        § 503.6   Cost calculations for new powerplants and installations.

#### § § 503.6

        (a)  (1) This calculation compares the cost of using alternate fuel to the cost of using imported petroleum. It must be performed for each alternate fuel and/or alternate site that the petitioner is required to examine.

        (2) The cost of using an alternate fuel as a primary energy source will be deemed to substantially exceed the cost of using imported petroleum if the difference between the cost of using alternate fuel and the cost of using imported oil is greater than zero.

        (3) There are two comparative cost calculations—a general cost test and a special cost test. Both take into consideration cash outlays for capital investments, annual expenses, and the effect of depreciation and taxes on cash flow. To demonstrate eligibility for a permanent exemption, a petitioner must use the procedures specified in the general cost test (paragraph (b) of this section). To demonstrate eligibility for a temporary exemption, the petitioner may apply the procedures specified in either the general cost test or the special cost test (paragraph (c) of this section).

        (b)  (1) A petitioner may be eligible for a permanent exemption if he can demonstrate that the cost of using an alternate fuel from the first year of operation substantially exceeds the cost of using imported petroleum. Unless the best practicable cost estimates as prescribed below will not materially change during the first ten years of operation of the unit (given the best information available at the time the petition is filed), the petitioner must also demonstrate that the cost of using an alternate fuel beginning at any time within the first ten years of operation and using imported petroleum or natural gas until such time ( delayed use of alternate fuel) would substantially exceed the cost of using only imported petroleum.

        (2) The petitioner would only be eligible for a temporary exemption if the computed costs of delayed alternate fuel use, commencing at the start of the second through eleventh years of operation, do not always substantially exceed the cost of using only imported petroleum. The length of the temporary exemption would be the minimum period from the start of operation in which the cost of using alternate fuel substantially exceeds the cost of using imported petroleum.

        (3) To conduct the general cost test, calculate the difference (DELTA) between the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) and the cost of using imported petroleum (COST(OIL)) using Equations 1 through 3 below and the comparison procedures in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (4) The terms in Equations 2 and 3 are defined as follows:

        (5) The step-by-step procedure that follows shows the comparison that the petitioner must make.

        (i) Compute the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) unit throughout the useful life of the unit using Equations 2 and 3.

        (ii) Compute the cost of using oil or natural gas (COST(OIL)) throughout the useful life of the unit using Equations 2 and 3.

        (iii) Using Equation 1, compute the difference (DELTA) between COST (ALTERNATE) and COST (OIL). If the difference (DELTA) is less than or equal to zero, a petitioner is not eligible for a permanent or temporary exemption using the general cost test and need not complete the remainder of the general cost test calculation. However, he still may be eligible for a temporary exemption using the special cost test (paragraph (c) of this section). If the difference (DELTA) is greater than zero and if the best practicable cost estimates will not materially change during the first ten years of operation (given the best information available at the time the petition is filed), the petitioner has completed the test and is eligible for a permanent exemption. However, if the best practicable cost estimate will materially change during the first ten years, the petitioner must complete the remainder of the general cost test—the delayed use calculations which follow.

        (iv) Recompute COST (ALTERNATE) with Equations 2 and 3, assuming that an alternate fuel is not used as the primary energy source until the start of the second year of operation and that imported petroleum or natural gas is used for the first year of operation. All cash outlays should reflect postponed use of alternate fuel.

        (v) Successively recompute COST (ALTERNATE) with Equations 2 and 3, assuming that the alternate fuel use is postponed until the start of the third year, fourth year, and so on, through the beginning of the eleventh year of operation (with imported petroleum or natural gas used in the years preceding alternate fuel use).

        (vi) Compute the difference (DELTA) between each of the ten COST(ALTERNATE)s calculated in paragraph (b)(5) (iv) and (v) of this section and the COST(OIL) calculated in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.

        (vii) If  the DELTAs computed in paragraph (b)(5) (iii) and (vi) of this section are greater than zero, the petitioner is eligible for a permanent exemption. If one or more of the DELTAs is less than or equal to zero, he is eligible for a temporary exemption for the period beginning at the start of the first year of operation and terminating at the beginning of the first year in which a DELTA is zero or less.

        (c)  (1) A petitioner may be eligible for a temporary exemption if he demonstrates that the cost of using an alternate fuel will substantially exceed the cost of using imported petroleum or (natural gas) over the period of the proposed exemption. The period of the proposed temporary exemption may not exceed ten years.

        (2) To conduct the test, calculate the difference (DELTA) between the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST (ALTERNATE)) and the cost of using imported petroleum (COST (OIL)) using Equations 4 and 5 below, Equation 3 (paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and the comparison procedures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        Capital investment (I) is calculated with Equation 3 (paragraph (b)(3) of this section).

        (3) The terms in Equation 5 are the same as those in Equation 2 with the addition of P, the length of the proposed temporary exemption in years. (See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for other terms.)

        (4) The step-by-step procedure that follows shows the comparisons which must be made.

        (i) Using Equation 5, compute the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) assuming the length of the proposed exemption is one year.

        (ii) Likewise, compute the cost of using imported petroleum or natural gas (COST(OIL)) assuming the length of the proposed exemption is one year.

        (iii) Compute the difference (DELTA) between COST (ALTERNATE) and COST (OIL) using Equation 4.

        (iv) Repeat the calculations made in (i), (ii), and (iii) above, assuming the length of the proposed exemption is two years, three years, four years, and so on, up through the period of the proposed exemption.

        (v) A petitioner is eligible for a temporary exemption for the period beginning at the start of the first year of operation and terminating at the beginning of the first year in which a DELTA is zero or less.

        (d)  (1) All estimated expenditures, except fuel, shall be expressed in real terms (unadjusted for inflation) by using the prices in effect at the time the petition is submitted. Instructions for fuel price calculations are contained in appendix II.

        (2) Cap*i*tal investment yearly cash outlays (I) must include all items that are capital investments for Federal income tax purposes. All purchased equipment that has a useful life greater than one year, capitalized engineering costs, land, construction, environmental offsets, fuel inventory, transmission facilities, piping, etc., that are necessary for the operation of the unit must be included. However, an item must only be included if a cash outlay is required after the decision has been made to build the unit; sunk costs must not be included ( if the firm owns the land, its purchase price may not be included).

        (3)(**i**) The annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expense (OM) and fuel expense (FL) for a powerplant may be computed by one of the following three methods; however, the one chosen must be consistently applied throughout the analysis.

        (A) Assume the energy produced by the powerplant equals seventy (70) percent of design capacity times 8760 hours for each year during the life of the powerplant, and compute cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses for the powerplant.

        (B)  The cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses of all powerplants being dispatched (where oil and natural gas are priced according to the procedures of appendix II  ) are the corresponding expenses for the purpose of the cost calculation. The dispatch analysis area must be that area with which the firm currently dispatches, anticipates dispatching, and will be interconnected. It must also include all anticipated exchanges of energy with other utilities or powerpools. The outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel may also be estimated using a methodology that incorporates the benefits of economically dispatching units and provides consistent treatment in the alternate fuel and oil or natural gas cases being compared.

        (C) Use a dispatch analysis to project the energy produced by the powerplant for a representative (not atypical) year of operation when consuming an alternate fuel. Compute the cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses for the powerplant based upon the level of energy production estimated for the representative year. The dispatch analysis and fuel expenses for the cost calculation must include oil and natural gas priced according to the procedures of appendix II.

        (**i**i) When computing the annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expense (OM) and fuel expense (FL) for an installation, specify the firing rates and the length of time each firing rate will be maintained.

        (4) The discount rate (k) for analyses is 2.9 percent or that which is computed as specified in appendix I. The method of computing the inflation index (IX) is shown in appendix II to part 504. OFE will modify these specified rates from time to time as required by changed conditions after public notice and an opportunity to comment. However, the relevant set of specified rates for a specific petition for exemption will be the set in effect at the time the petition is submitted or the set in effect at the time a decision is rendered, whichever set is more favorable to the petitioner.

        (5)(i) The guidelines for the useful life (N) of all powerplants except nuclear will be thirty-five (35) years. The guidelines for the useful life of a nuclear powerplant will be forty (40) years. The guidelines for the useful life of major fuel burning installations will be forty (40) years. Other useful life projections may be used if they are more appropriate than these guidelines; however, the source or derivation of these projections must be contained in the evidential summary. The summary should include a discussion of engineering, economic historical or other evidence.

        (ii) If the units being compared have different useful lives, the petitioner will have to modify his calculation so that the two cash flows being compared have the length of the shorter useful life. To do this, (A) use the shorter of the two useful lives in Equations 2 and 5 for both units, and (B) multiply capital investment (I) of the unit with the longer life (computed with Equation 3) by the following adjustment factor (A):

        (6) All Federal ***i***nvestment tax credits (ITC) and depreciation (PR) values are those used for Federal income tax purposes and must be applied consistently throughout the analysis and in a manner consistent with the Federal tax laws. All investment tax credits allowed under Federal tax law must be reflected in the computations. The petitioner must use the method of depreciation which results in the greatest present value of the cash flow due to the tax and depreciation effect. The marginal income tax rate (t) is the firm's anticipated marginal Federal income tax rate in year i. The relevant investment tax credits, depreciation methodology, and marginal Federal income tax rates for a specific exemption petition will be those prescribed by Federal law in effect (or those tax parameters which are known with certainty will be in effect) at the time a decision is rendered. (However, if an investment tax credit expires in a certain year under the law which is in effect at the time the petition is submitted, the petitioner must assume that it will in fact expire in that year.)

        (7) If powerplants are being compared, the design capacities or the maximum sustained energy per unit of time that could be produced must be the same. If installations are being compared, the maximum sustained energy per unit of time that could be produced must be the same.

        (8) All estimated cash outlays must be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

        (9) The scope of the estimates of relevant costs (as discussed above) of units being compared must be the same.

        (10) All allowances for uncertainty and risk in the cost estimates must be explicit.

        (11) All cash outlays must be net of any government subsidies or grants.

        (e)  Petitioners for an exemption which requires the use of the cost calculation shall certify that the cost of using alternate fuel substantially exceeds the cost of using oil as primary energy source as calculated in this section. A brief summary of the petitioner's supporting calculations and estimates shall be submitted with the certification. The summary should include the following:

        (1) Cash outlays, Investment tax credits, depreciation methodologies, and anticipated salvage for capital investments including a description of all major construction and equipment;

        (2) Annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expenses including the formulas used to compute them; and

        (3) Annual cash outlays for delivered fuel expenses including the formulas used to compute them.

        § 503.7   State approval—general requirement for new powerplants.

#### § § 503.7

        (a) Where approvals by the appropriate State regulatory authority are required prior to the construction or use of a new powerplant, a petition for an exemption for consideration by OFE may be submitted to OFE prior to obtaining such approvals from the State regulatory authority.

        (b) An exemption granted for a powerplant shall not become effective until an adequate demonstration has been made to OFE that all applicable approvals required by the State regulatory authorities have been obtained.

        § 503.8   No alternate power supply—general requirement for certain exemptions for new powerplants.

#### § § 503.8

        (a)  To qualify for an exemption, except in the case of an exemption for cogeneration units, section 213(c) of the Act requires a demonstration that, despite reasonable good faith efforts, there is no alternative supply of electric power available within a reasonable distance at a reasonable cost without impairing short-run or long-run reliability of service. If a petitioner is unable to demonstrate that there is no alternate supply during the first year of operation, OFE will conclude that the absence of the proposed powerplant will not impair short-term reliability of service, and as a result will not grant the exemption. Such action would not impair long-term reliability of service, since a petition may be submitted for a powerplant that would begin operation in a subsequent year.

        (b)  To meet the demonstration required under paragraph (a) of this section, a petitioner must certify that:

        (1) A diligent effort has been made to purchase firm power for the first year of operation to cover all or part of the projected shortfall at a cost that is less than ten (10) percent above the annualized cost of generating power from the proposed plant (including the capital, operation and maintenance expenses, and fuel prices); and

        (2)(i) Despite these efforts, the reserve margin in the petitioner's electric region, normal dispatch area, or service area, in the absence of the proposed plant, would fall below twenty (20) percent during the first year of proposed operation; or

        (ii) Despite these efforts, the reserve margin will be greater than twenty (20) percent but reliability of service would be impaired. In such case, the certification must be related to factors not included in the calculation of reserve margin, such as transmission constraints.

        (c)  The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:

        (1) Duly executed certification required under paragraph (b) of this section; and

        (2) Exhibits containing the basis for the certification submitted under this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support its certification to this general requirement).

        (d)  OFE will forward a copy of any petition for which a showing is required under this section to FERC promptly after it is filed with OFE, and OFE will consult with FERC before making the no alternate supply of power finding.

        § 503.9   Use of mixtures—general requirement for certain permanent exemptions.

#### § § 503.9

        (a)  To qualify for a permanent exemption, except in the case of an exemption for fuel mixtures, section 213(a)(1) of the Act requires a demonstration that the use of a mixture of natural gas and petroleum and an alternate fuel for which an exemption under 10 CFR 503.38 (Fuel mixtures) would be available, would not be economically or technically feasible.

        (b)  The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:

        (1) Duly executed certifications to the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and

        (2) Exhibits containing the basis for the certifications submitted under this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support its certifications to this general requirement.)

#### § § 503.10

        (a)  Except in the case of an exemption for fuel mixtures, OFE may deny permanent exemptions authorized under section 212 of the Act if OFE finds on a site-specific or generic basis that use of a method of fluidized bed combustion of an alternate fuel is economically and technically feasible.

        (b)  If OFE has made such a finding, OFE will deny a petitioner's request for exemption unless the petitioner demonstrated that the use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not economically or technically feasible. The petition or any supplement thereto required by OFE must include the following evidence:

        (1) If use of a method of fluidized bed combustion were to be required, evidence that the petitioner would be eligible for a permanent exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, environmental requirements, lack of adequate capital, or State or local requirements; or

        (2) Use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not technically or economically feasible due to design or special circumstances.

        (b)  (1) Any compliance plan required to accompany a petition for a temporary exemption shall include the following:

        (i) A detailed schedule of progressive events and the dates upon which the events are to take place, indicating how compliance with the applicable prohibitions of the Act will occur;

        (ii) Evidence of binding contracts for fuel, or for facilities for the production of fuel, which are required for compliance with the applicable prohibitions of the Act;

        (iii) A schedule indicating how any necessary permits and approvals required to burn an alternate fuel will be obtained; and

        (iv) Any other documentary evidence which indicates an ability to comply with the applicable prohibitions of the Act.

        (2) Any exemption for which a compliance plan is required shall not be effective until the compliance plan is approved by DOE.

        (3) If the petition is granted, an updated, duly executed plan must be submitted to OFE within one (1) month of an alteration of any milestone in the compliance plan, together with the reasons for the alteration and its impact upon the scheduling of all other milestones in the plan.

        § 503.13   Environmental impact analysis.

#### § § 503.13

        In order to enable OFE to comply with NEPA, a petitioner must include the information indicated in this section if a permanent exemption is requested. Material which has been prepared pursuant to any Federal, State or local requirement for environmental information for this unit or site may be incorporated by reference and appended to the petition. Guidelines issued by OFE for environmental reports should be used in preparing this analysis (44 FR 63740, November 5, 1979). These guidelines, which are also available in the OFE public document room, have been designed to insure that environmental reports follow the format prescribed by Council on Environmental Quality final regulations implementing NEPA. The guidelines are subject to discussion at a prepetition conference and to modification according to the facts of a particular case.

        (a) All petitions for permanent exemptions must contain the following information:

        (1) A description of the facility, including site location, and surroundings, alternative site(s), the facility's current proposed operations, its fuel capability, and its pollution abatement systems and equipment (including those systems and equipment necessary for all fuel scenarios considered);

        (2) A description of the existing environment, including air, water, and land resources;

        (3) Direct and indirect environmental impacts of the proposed action including impacts of alternative fuel scenarios, and no build alternatives.

        (4) Regulatory requirements governing the facility, including a description of Federal, State and local requirements for air, water, noise and solid waste disposal which must be met for each fuel considered.

        (b) For exemptions for cogeneration, the information enumerated below is to be submitted in lieu of the information required by paragraph (a) of this section. However, submission of the following information merely establishes a rebuttable presumption that the grant or denial of the exemption would have no significant environmental impact. OFE may, in individual cases, during the course of the administrative proceeding, determine that additional environmental information is required. In such cases, the petitioner will be required to submit the information described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (1) A certification that the petitioner will, prior to operating the unit under the exemption, secure all applicable environmental permits and approvals pursuant to, but not limited to, the following: Clean Air Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and

        (2) Information required by the following environmental checklist must be provided and certified as accurate:

        § 503.14   Fuels search.

#### § § 503.14

        Prior to submitting a petition for a permanent exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, inadequate capital, or state or local requirements, a petitioner must examine the use of conventional solid coal as a primary energy source at the site under consideration, and at reasonable alternative sites. Where a petitioner believes that its use of such coal would be infeasible, however, and where OFE and the petitioner can reach accord, it may evaluate use of a different alternate fuel in lieu of solid coal. A petitioner of these exemptions must demonstrate for any fuel examined that he would qualify for an exemption.

      § 504.5   Prohibitions by order (certifying powerplants under section 301 of FUA, as amended).

#### § § 504.5

      (a) In the case of existing powerplants, OFP may prohibit, in accordance with section 301 of the Act, as amended, the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source where the owner or operator of the powerplant presents a complete certification concurred in by OFP. The certification, which may be presented at any time, pertains to the unit's technical capability and financial feasibility to use coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source in the unit. The informational requirements necessary to support a certification are contained in § 504.6 of these regulations. A prohibition compliance schedule which meets the requirements of § 504.5(d) shall also be submitted.

      (b) If OFP concurs with the certification, a prohibition order on the powerplant's use of petroleum or natural gas will be issued following the procedure outlined in § 501.52 of these regulations.

      (c) The petitioner may amend its certification at any time prior to the effective date of the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances by following the procedure contained in § 501.52(d).

      (d)  The certification described above, which forms the basis for the issuance of a prohibition order to a powerplant, shall include a prohibition order compliance schedule. The compliance schedule should contain the following:

      (1) A schedule of progressive events involved in the conversion project, including construction of any facilities for the production of fuel or fuel handling equipment, and contracts for the purchase of alternate fuels, and estimated date of compliance with the applicable prohibitions of the Act; and

      (2) A schedule indicating estimated dates for obtaining necessary federal, state, and local permits and approvals. Any prohibition order issued under the certification provisions of §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 will be subject to appropriate conditions subsequent so as to delay the effectiveness of the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order until the above events or permits have occurred or been obtained.

      § 504.6   Prohibitions by order (case-by-case).

#### § § 504.6

      (a) OFP may prohibit, by order, the use of natural gas or petroleum as a primary energy source in existing powerplants under certain circumstances. In the case of certifying powerplants under section 301 of the Act, as amended, the petitioner must present evidence to support the certification, required by § 504.6 (c), (d), (e), and (f). In the case of electing powerplants, OFP must make the following findings required by § 504.6 (c), (d), (e), and (f), in order to issue a prohibition order to the unit, pursuant to former section 301 (b) or (c):

      (1) The unit currently has, or previously had, the technical capability to use an alternate fuel as a primary energy source;

      (2) The unit has this technical capability now, or it could have the technical capability without:

      (i) A substantial physical modification of the unit; or

      (ii) A substantial reduction in the rated capacity of the unit; and

      (3) It is financially feasible for the unit to use an alternate fuel as its primary energy source.

      (b) In the case of electing powerplants, OFP must make a proposed finding regarding the technical capability of a unit to use alternate fuel as identified in paragraph (a) (1) of this section prior to the date of publication of the notice of the proposed prohibition. OFP will publish this finding in The  along with the notice of the proposed prohibition.

      (c)  (1) In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will consider “technical capability” on a case-by-case basis in order to make the required finding. In the case of a certifying powerplant, the powerplant should present information to support the certification relevant to the considerations set forth below. OFP will consider the ability of the unit, from the point of fuel intake to physically sustain combustion of a given fuel and to maintain heat transfer.

      (2) OFP considers that a unit “had” the technical capability to use an alternate fuel if the unit was once able to burn that fuel (regardless of whether the unit was expressly designed to burn that fuel or whether it ever actually did burn it), but is no longer able to do so at the present due to temporary or permanent alterations to the unit itself.

      (3) A unit “has” the technical capability to use an alternate fuel if it can burn an alternate fuel, notwithstanding the fact that adjustments must be made to the unit beforehand or that pollution control equipment may be required to meet air quality requirements.

      (d)  In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will make its determination on whether a physical modification to a unit is “substantial” on a case-by-case basis. In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP will consider the factors set forth below for the purpose of concurrence in the certification. OFP will consider physical modifications made to the unit as “substantial” where warranted by the magnitude and complexity of the engineering task or where the modification would impact severely upon operations at the site.   OFP will not, however, assess physical modification on the basis of cost.

      (e)  In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will make this determination on the basis of the following factors. A certifying powerplant should present information to support its certification regarding these factors in order for OFP to make its review for concurrence.

      (1) OFP regards a unit's derating of 25 percent or more, as a result of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, as substantial.

      (2) OFP will presume that a derating of less than 10 percent, as a result of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, is not substantial unless convincing evidence to the contrary is submitted in rebuttal.

      (3) OFP will assess units for which a derating is claimed of 10 percent or more, but less than 25 percent, on a case-by-case.

      (4) In assessing whether a unit's derating is not substantial, OFP will consider the impact of a reduction in rated capacity of the unit taking into consideration all necessary appurtenances such as air pollution control equipment required to burn an alternate fuel in compliance with environmental requirements expected to be applicable at the date the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order become effective. However, the potential order recipient may raise in rebuttal the impact of derating on the site at which the unit is located and on the system as well as on the unit itself, if under paragraph (e)(2), or case-by-case, if under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (f)  In the case of certifying and electing powerplants, OFP will make this finding based on the following considerations. A certifying powerplant should present information to support its certification relevant to these considerations in order for OFP to make its review for concurrence. Conversion of a unit to burn coal or an alternate fuel shall be deemed financially feasible if the firm has the actual ability to obtain sufficient capital to finance the conversion, including all necessary land, coal and ash handling equipment, pollution control equipment, and all other necessary expenditures, without violating legal restrictions on its ability to raise debt or equity capital, unreasonably diluting shareholder equity, or unreasonably adversely affecting its credit rating. OFP will consider any economic or financial factors presented by the proposed order recipient in determining the firm's ability or inability to finance the conversion including, but not limited to, the following:

      (1) The required coverage ratios on the firm's debt and preferred stock;

      (2) The firm's investment program; and

      (3) The financial impact of the conversion, including other conversions which are or may be undertaken voluntarily by the proposed order recipient or imposed upon the recipient's system by the Act, and including pending or planned construction or reconstruction of alternate-fuel-fired plants and plants exempt from FUA prohibitions.   Where helpful in clarifying the long-term financial feasibility of a conversion, DOE may analyze the economic benefits anticipated from operation of the converted unit or units using coal or other alternate fuel relative to those from continued operation using petroleum or natural gas.

      § 504.7   Prohibition against excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in mixtures—electing powerplants.

#### § § 504.7

      (a) In the case of electing powerplants, if OFP finds that it is technically and financially feasible for a unit to use a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and an alternate fuel as its primary energy source, OFP may prohibit, by order, the use in that unit of petroleum or natural gas, or both, in amounts exceeding the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency of the mixture.

      (b) In making the technical feasibility finding required by former section 301 (b) and (c) of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section, OFP may weigh “physical modification” or “derating of the unit,” but these considerations, by themselves, will not control the technical feasibility finding. A technical feasibility finding might be made notwithstanding the need for substantial physical modification. The economic consequences of a substantial physical modification are taken into account in determining financial feasibility.

      § 504.8   Prohibitions against excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in mixtures—certifying powerplants.

#### § § 504.8

      (a) In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP may prohibit the use of petroleum or natural gas in such powerplant in amounts exceeding the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining the reasonable fuel efficiency of the mixture. This authority is contained in section 301(c) of the Act, as amended. The owner or operator of the powerplant may certify at any time to OFP that it is technically capable and financially feasible for the unit to use a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source. In assessing whether the unit is technically capable of using a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source, for purposes of this section, the extent of any physical modification necessary to convert the unit and any concomitant reduction in rated capacity are not relevant factors. So long as a unit as proposed to be modified would be technically capable of using the mixture as a primary energy source under § 504.6(c), this certification requirement shall be deemed met. The criteria for certification of financial feasibility are found at § 504.6(f). In addition, the powerplant's owner or operator must submit a prohibition compliance schedule, which meets the requirements of § 504.5(d).

      (b) If OFP concurs with the certification, a prohibition order against the unit's excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in the mixture will be issued following the procedure outlined in § 501.52 of these regulations.

      (c) The petitioner may seek to amend its certification in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances by following the procedure contained in § 501.52(d).

> [47 FR 17045, Apr. 21, 1982]

      § 504.9   Environmental requirements for certifying powerplants.

#### § § 504.9

      Under §§ 501.52, 504.5 and 504.6 of these regulations, OFP may prohibit, in accordance with section 301 and section 303 (a) or (b) of FUA, as amended, the use of natural gas or petroleum, or both, as a primary energy source in any certifying powerplant. Under sections 301(c) and 303(a) of FUA, as amended, and §§ 501.52, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations, OFP may prohibit the excessive use of natural gas or petroleum in a mixture with an alternate fuel as a primary energy source in a certifying powerplant.

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, where the owner or operator of a powerplant seeks to obtain an OFP prohibition order through the certification procedure, and did not hold either a proposed prohibition order under former section 301 of FUA or pending order under section 2 of ESECA, it will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) arising from OFP's obligation to comply with NEPA. The powerplant owner or operator shall enter into a contract with an independent party selected by OFP, who is qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EA or EIS, as appropriate, and who does not have a financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings, under the supervision of OFP. The NEPA process must be completed and approved before OFP will issue a final prohibition order based on the certification.

      (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, environmental documents, including the EA and EIS, where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. OFP, the powerplant owner or operator and the independent third party shall enter into an agreement for the owner or operator to engage and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to prepare the necessary documents. The third party will execute an OFP prepared disclosure document stating that he does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of either the environmental process or the prohibition order proceeding. The agreement shall outline the responsibilities of each party and his relationship to the other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. OFP shall approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, analysis and presentation of the information. In addition, OFP will have the authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion contained in the third party prepared environmental documents.

      (c)  Whenever the bona fide estimate of the costs associated with NEPA compliance, if borne by the powerplant owner or operator, would make the conversion financially infeasible, OFP may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review.

        (b) Any party may file an answer to any written motion within fifteen (15) days after the motion is filed, unless another period of time is established by the Assistant Secretary or the presiding official. Answers shall be in writing and shall detail each material allegation of the motion being answered. Answers shall state clearly and concisely the facts and legal authorities relied upon.

        (c) Any motion, except for motions seeking intervention or requesting that a conference, oral presentation or trial-type hearing be held, shall be deemed to have been denied, unless the Assistant Secretary or presiding official acts within thirty (30) days after the motion is filed.

        (a) A state commission may intervene in a proceeding under this part as a matter of right and become a party to the proceeding by filing a notice of intervention no later than the date fixed for filing motions to intervene in the applicable FE notice or order. If the period for filing the notice has expired, a state commission may be permitted to intervene by complying with the filing and other requirements applicable to any other person seeking to become a party to the proceeding as provided in this section.

Each motion or notice shall list the names, titles, and mailing addresses of a maximum of two persons for the official service list.

        (e) Any party may file an answer to a motion to intervene, but such answer shall be made within fifteen (15) days after the motion to intervene was filed, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown. Answers shall be in writing. Answers shall detail each material allegation of the motion to intervene being answered and state clearly and concisely the facts and legal authorities relied upon. Failure to answer is deemed a waiver of any objection to the intervention. This paragraph does not prevent the Assistant Secretary from ruling on a motion to intervene and issuing a final opinion and order in accordance with § 590.316 prior to the expiration of the fifteen (15) days in which a party has to answer a motion to intervene.

        (f) If an answer in opposition to a motion to intervene is timely filed or if the motion to intervene is not timely filed, then the movant becomes a party only after the motion to intervene is expressly granted.

        (g) If no answer in opposition to a motion to intervene is filed within the period of time prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, the motion to intervene shall be deemed to be granted, unless the Assistant Secretary denies the motion in whole or in part or otherwise limits the intervention prior to the expiration of the time allowed in paragraph (e) for filing an answer to the motion to intervene. Where the motion to intervene is deemed granted, the participation of the intervenor shall be limited to matters affecting asserted rights and interests specifically set forth in the motion to intervene, and the admission of such intervenor to party status shall not be construed as recognition by FE that the intervenor might be aggrieved because of any order issued.

        (h) In the event that a motion for late intervention is granted, an intervenor shall accept the record of the proceeding as it was developed prior to the intervention.

        § 590.304   Protests and answers.

The protest shall identify the person filing the protest, the application or action being objected to, and provide a concise statement of the reasons for the protest.

        (b) The filing of a protest, without also filing a motion to intervene or a notice of intervention, shall not make the person filing the protest a party to the proceeding.

        (c) A protest shall be made part of the official FE docket file in the proceeding and shall be considered as a statement of position of the person filing the protest, but not as establishing the validity of any assertion upon which the decision would be based.

        (d) Protests shall be served on the applicant and all parties by the person filing the protest. If the person filing the protest is unable to provide service on any person identified as a party to the proceeding after a good faith effort, then FE shall effect service. However, when the parties are not known, service requirements may be met by serving a copy on the applicant and on FE as provided in § 590.107(b).

        (e) Protests may be filed at any time following the filing of an application, but no later than the date fixed for filing protests in the applicable FE notice or order, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown.

        (d) A copy of all requests for admission and answers thereto shall be filed with FE in accordance with § 590.103. Copies of any documents referenced in the request shall be served with the request unless they are known to be in the possession of the other parties.

        (e) The Assistant Secretary or presiding official may limit the number of requests for admission of facts in order to expedite a proceeding through elimination of duplicative requests.

        § 590.309   Settlements.

#### § § 590.309

        The parties may conduct settlement negotiations. If settlement negotiations are conducted during a conference, at the request of one of the parties, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may order that the discussions be off-the-record with no transcript of such settlement negotiations being prepared for inclusion in the official record of the proceeding. No offer of settlement, comment or discussion by the parties with respect to an offer of settlement shall be subject to discovery or admissible into evidence against any parties who object to its admission.

        § 590.310   Opportunity for additional procedures.

#### § § 590.310

        Any party may file a motion requesting additional procedures, including the opportunity to file written comments, request written interrogatories or other discovery procedures, or request that a conference, oral presentation or trial-type hearing be held. The motion shall describe what type of procedure is requested and include the information required by §§ 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313, as appropriate. Failure to request additional procedures within the time specified in the notice of application or in the notice of procedure, if applicable, shall constitute a waiver of that right unless the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown grants additional time for requesting additional procedures. If no time limit is specified in the notice or order, additional procedures may be requested at any time prior to the issuance of a final opinion and order. At any time during a proceeding, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may on his or her own initiative determine to provide additional procedures.

        (d) The Assistant Secretary or presiding official may make such rulings for trial-type hearings, including delineation of the issues and limitation of cross-examination of a witness, as are necessary to obtain a full and true disclosure of the facts and to limit irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

        (e) At trial-type hearings, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official, or any other decisional employee directed by the Assistant Secretary or presiding official, may call witnesses for testimony or presenting exhibits that directly relate to a particular issue of fact to be considered at the hearing. The Assistant Secretary or presiding official, or any other decisional employee directed by the Assistant Secretary or presiding official, may also question witnesses offered by the parties concerning their testimony.

        (b) A complaint concerning an existing import or export authorization shall be served on all parties to the original import or export authorization proceeding either by the complainant or by FE if the complainant has made a good faith effort but has been unable to effect service.

        (c) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order to show cause under § 590.401, or may provide opportunity for additional procedures pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312, or § 590.313, in order to determine what action should be taken in response to the complaint.

      Subpart D—Opinions and Orders

        A proceeding under this part may commence upon the initiative of the Assistant Secretary or in response to an application by any person requesting FE action against any other person alleged to be in contravention or violation of any authorization, statute, rule, order, or law administered by FE applicable to the import or export of natural gas, or for any other alleged wrong involving importation or exportation of natural gas over which FE has jurisdiction. Any show cause order issued shall identify the matters of interest or the matters complained of that the Assistant Secretary is inquiring about, and shall be deemed to be tentative and for the purpose of framing issues for consideration and decision. The respondent named in the order shall respond orally or in writing, or both, as required by the order. A show cause order is not a final opinion and order.

        § 590.402   Conditional orders.

#### § § 590.402

        The Assistant Secretary may issue a conditional order at any time during a proceeding prior to issuance of a final opinion and order.

        § 590.403   Emergency interim orders.

#### § § 590.403

        Where consistent with the public interest, the Assistant Secretary may waive further procedures and issue an emergency interim order authorizing the import or export of natural gas.

        § 590.407   Reports of changes.

#### § § 590.407

Any notification filed under this section shall contain the FE docket number(s) to which it relates. Compliance with this section does not relieve an importer or exporter from responsibility to file the appropriate application to amend a previous import or export authorization under this part whenever such changes are contrary to or otherwise not permitted by the existing authorization.

      Subpart E—Applications for Rehearing

        § 590.501   Filing.

#### § § 590.501

        (a) An application for rehearing of a final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order may be filed by any party aggrieved by the issuance of such opinion and order within thirty (30) days after issuance. The application shall be served on all parties.

        (b) The application shall state concisely the alleged errors in the final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order and must set forth specifically the ground or grounds upon which the application is based. If an order is sought to be vacated, reversed, or modified by reason of matters that have arisen since the issuance of the final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order, the matters relied upon shall be set forth with specificity in the application. The application shall also comply with the filing requirements of § 590.103.

        § 590.502   Application is not a stay.

#### § § 590.502

#### § § 590.503

        Upon application for rehearing, the Assistant Secretary may grant or deny rehearing or may abrogate or modify the final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order with or without further proceedings.

        § 590.504   Denial by operation of law.

#### § § 590.504

        Unless the Assistant Secretary acts upon the application for rehearing within thirty (30) days after it is filed, it is deemed to be denied. Such denial shall constitute final agency action for the purpose of judicial review.

        § 590.505   Answers to applications for rehearing.

#### § § 590.505

        No answers to applications for rehearing shall be entertained.

        § 600.4   Deviations.

#### § § 600.4

        (a)  (1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with §§ 600.114, 600.212, and 600.304 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 600.30 are not subject to this section.

        (2) A single-case deviation is a deviation which applies to one financial assistance transaction and one applicant, recipient, or subrecipient only.

        (3) A class deviation is a deviation which applies to more than one financial assistance transaction, applicant, recipient, or subrecipient.

        (b) The DOE officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section may authorize a deviation only upon a written determination that the deviation is—

        (1) Necessary to achieve program objectives;

        (2) Necessary to conserve public funds;

        (3) Otherwise essential to the public interest; or

        (4) Necessary to achieve equity.

        (c)  (1) A deviation request must be in writing and must be submitted to the responsible DOE Contracting Officer. An applicant for a subaward or a subrecipient shall submit any such request through the recipient.

        § 600.5   Selection of award instrument.

#### § § 600.5

        (a) If DOE has administrative discretion in the selection of the award instrument, the DOE decision as to whether the relationship is principally one of procurement or financial assistance shall be made pursuant to the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act as codified at 31 U.S.C. 6301-6306. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be the appropriate instrument, in accordance with this part, when the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money or property to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. In selecting the type of financial assistance instrument, DOE shall limit involvement between itself and the recipient in the performance of a project to the minimum necessary to achieve DOE program objectives.

        (b) When it is anticipated that substantial involvement will be necessary between DOE and the recipient during performance of the contemplated activity, the award instrument shall be a cooperative agreement rather than a grant. Every cooperative agreement shall explicitly state the substantial involvement anticipated between DOE and the recipient during the performance of the project. Substantial involvement exists if:

        (1) Responsibility for the management, control, or direction of the project is shared by DOE and the recipient; or

        (2) Responsibility for the performance of the project is shared by DOE and the recipient.

        (c) Providing technical assistance or guidance of a programmatic nature to a recipient does not constitute substantial involvement if:

        (1) the recipient is not required to follow such guidance;

        (2) the technical assistance or guidance is not expected to result in continuing DOE involvement in the performance of the project; or

        (3) The technical assistance or guidance pertains solely to the administrative requirements of the award.

        (d) In cooperative agreements, DOE has the right to intervene in the conduct or performance of project activities for programmatic reasons. Intervention includes the interruption or modification of the conduct or performance of project activities. Suspension or termination of the cooperative agreement under §§ 600.162, 600.243 and 600.352 does not constitute intervention in the conduct or performance of project activities.

        § 600.6   Eligibility.

#### § § 600.6

        (a)  DOE shall solicit applications for financial assistance in a manner which provides for the maximum amount of competition feasible.

        (b)  If DOE restricts eligibility, an explanation of why the restriction of eligibility is considered necessary shall be included in the funding opportunity announcement, program rule, or published notice.

        (1) If the aggregate amount of DOE funds available for award under a funding opportunity announcement or published notice is $1million or more, unless authorized by statute or program rule, such restriction of eligibility shall be:

        (i) Supported by a written determination initiated by the program office;

        (ii) Concurred in by legal counsel and the Contracting Officer; and

        (iii) Approved by an official no less than one level below the responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or other official of equivalent authority.

        (2) Where the amount of DOE funds is less than $1 million, the cognizant HCA and the Contracting Officer may approve the determination.

        (c)  DOE may award a grant or cooperative agreement or technology investment agreement on a noncompetitive basis only if the application satisfies one or more of the follow selection criteria:.

        (1) The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation or renewal of, an activity presently being funded by DOE or another Federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.

        (2) The activity is being or would be conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provided by third parties; however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.

        (3) The applicant is a unit of government and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction, thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity.

        (4) The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique equipment, proprietary data, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications.

        (5) The award implements an agreement between the United States Government and a foreign government to fund a foreign applicant.

        (6) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare or national security requirement preclude competition.

        (7) The proposed project was submitted as an unsolicited proposal and represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned funding opportunity announcement, and if, as determined by DOE, a competitive funding opportunity announcement would not be appropriate.

        (8) The responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or other official of equivalent authority determines that a noncompetitive award is in the public interest. This authority may not be delegated.

        (d)  (1) Where the amount of DOE funds is $1 million or greater, determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:

        (i) Documented in writing;

        (ii) Concurred in by the responsible program technical official and local legal counsel; and

        (iii) Approved, prior to award, by the responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or official of equivalent authority and the Contracting Officer. The approval authority may be delegated to one organizational level below the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or official of equivalent authority.

        (2) Where the amount of DOE funds is less than $1 million, determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:

        (i) Documented in writing;

        (ii) Concurred in by local legal counsel, unless for a particular award or class of awards of $1 million or less, review is waived by legal counsel; and

        (iii) Approved by the cognizant HCA and the Contracting Officer.

        § 600.8   Funding Opportunity Announcement.

#### § § 600.8

        (a)  Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) include any issuance used to announce funding opportunities that would result in the award of a discretionary grant, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement, whether it is called a program announcement, program notice, solicitation, broad agency announcement, research announcement, notice of program interest, or something else.

        (1) A Program Assistant Secretary (or official of equivalent authority) may annually issue a program notice describing research areas in which financial assistance is being made available. Such notice shall also state whether the research areas covered by the notice are to be added to those listed in a previously issued program rule. If they are to be included, then applications received as a result of the notice may be treated as having been in response to that previously published program rule. If they are not to be included, then applications received in response to the notice are to be treated as unsolicited applications. FOAs may be issued by a DOE Contracting Officer or program office with prior concurrence of the contracting office.

        (2) DOE must post synopses of its FOAs and modifications to the announcements at the Grants.gov Internet site, using the standard data elements/format, except for:

        (i) Announcements of funding opportunities for awards less than $25,000 for which 100 percent of eligible applicants live outside of the United States.

        (ii) Single source announcements of funding opportunities which are specifically directed to a known recipient.

        (b)  In accordance with the provisions of the applicable statute and program rules, if a DOE financial assistance program involves the award of financial assistance by a recipient to a subrecipient, the recipient shall provide sufficient advance notice so that potential subrecipients may prepare timely applications and secure prerequisite reviews and approvals.

        (c)  DOE must use the government-wide standard format to publish program announcements of funding opportunities.

        (a)  Applications shall be required for all financial assistance projects or programs.

        (b)  Applications shall be on the form specified in a program rule, the program announcement, or these regulations. (See also §§ 600.112 and 600.210.) For unsolicited applications, a guide for preparation and submission is available from U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Technology Center, Attn: Unsolicited Proposal Manager, Post Office Box 10940, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0940.

        (c)  In general, a financial assistance application shall include:

        (1) A facesheet containing basic identifying information. The facesheet shall be the Standard Form (SF)424;

        (2) A detailed narrative description of the proposed project, including the objectives of the project and the applicant's plan for carrying it out;

        (3) A budget with supporting justification; and

        (d)  DOE may return an application that:

        (1) Is not signed, either in writing or electronically, by an official authorized to bind the applicant; or

        (2) Omits any information or documentation required by statute, program rule, or the solicitation, if the nature of the omission precludes review of the application.

        (e)  During the review of a complete application, DOE may request the submission of additional information only if the information is essential to evaluate the application.

        (f) Registration is required in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) for all applications. Information on registration can be obtained at

#### § § 600.13

        (a) It is the policy of DOE that discretionary financial assistance be awarded through a merit-based selection process. A merit review means a thorough, consistent, and objective examination of applications based on pre-established criteria by persons who are independent of those submitting the applications and who are knowledgeable in the field of endeavor for which support is requested.

        (b) Each program office must establish a merit review system covering the financial assistance programs it administers. Merit review of financial assistance applications is intended to be advisory and is not intended to replace the authority of the project/program official with responsibility for deciding whether an award will be made.

        § 600.15   Authorized uses of information.

#### § § 600.15

        (a)  Information contained in applications shall be used only for evaluation purposes unless such information is generally available to the public or is already the property of the Government. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prohibits the unauthorized disclosure by Federal employees of trade secret and confidential business information.

        (b)  (1) An application or other document, including any unsolicited information, may include technical data and other data, including trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential, which the applicant does not want disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than application evaluation.

        (i) To protect such data, the submitter must mark the cover sheet of the application or other document with the following Notice:

        (ii)(A) To further protect such data, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, each page containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential must be specifically identified and marked with text similar to the following:

        May contain trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and exempt from public disclosure.

        (B) In addition, each line or paragraph containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential must be marked with brackets or other clear identification, such as highlighting.

        (iii) (A) In the case where a form for data submission is unalterable, such as certain forms submitted through Grants.gov, submitters must include in a cover letter or the project narrative a notice like the following:

        (B) The cover letter or project narrative must also specify the particular information on such forms that the submitter believes contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

        (2) Unless DOE specifies otherwise, DOE shall not refuse to consider an application or other document solely on the basis that the application or other document is restrictively marked in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (3) Data (or abstracts of data) specifically marked in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be used by DOE or its designated representatives solely for the purpose of evaluating the proposal. The data so marked shall not be disclosed or used for any other purpose except to the extent provided in any resulting assistance agreement, or to the extent required by law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (10 CFR Part 1004). The Government shall not be liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose such data for any purpose.

        (4) This process enables DOE to follow the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11(d) in the event a Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) request is received for the data submitted, such that information not identified as subject to a claim of exemption may be released without obtaining the submitter's views under the process set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11(c)

        (b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes acceptance; however, DOE may require formal acceptance of an award.

        (c) DOE funds awarded under a grant, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement shall be obligated as of the date the DOE Contracting Officer signs the award; however, the recipient is not authorized to incur costs under an award prior to the beginning date of the budget period shown in the award except as may be authorized in accordance with §§ 600.125(e), 600.230, 600.317(b), or 603.830 of this part. The duration of the DOE financial obligation shall not extend beyond the expiration date of the budget period shown in the award unless authorized by a DOE Contracting Officer by means of a continuation or renewal award or other extension of the budget period.

        § 600.22   Disputes and appeals.

#### § § 600.22

        (a)  Whenever practicable, DOE shall attempt to resolve informally any dispute over the award or administration of financial assistance. Informal resolution, including resolution through an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, shall be preferred over formal procedures, to the extent practicable.

        (b)  Before issuing a final determination in any dispute in which informal resolution has not been achieved, the Contracting Officer shall suggest that the other party consider the use of voluntary consensual methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation. The DOE dispute resolution specialist is available to provide assistance for such disputes, as are trained mediators of other federal agencies. ADR may be used at any stage of a dispute.

        (c)  Whenever a dispute is not resolved informally or through an alternative dispute resolution process, DOE shall mail (by certified mail) a brief written determination signed by a Contracting Officer, setting forth DOE's final disposition of such dispute. Such determination shall contain the following information:

        (1) A summary of the dispute, including a statement of the issues and of the positions taken by the Department and the party or parties to the dispute; and

        (2) The factual, legal and, if appropriate, policy reasons for DOE's disposition of the dispute.

        (d)  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the final determination under paragraph (c) of this section may be appealed to the cognizant Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for either DOE or the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The mailing address for the DOE SPE is Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, 1000 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20585. The mailing address for the NNSA SPE is Office of Acquisition and Supply Management, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585.

        (e)  The filing of an appeal with the SPE shall not stay any determination or action taken by DOE which is the subject of the appeal. Consistent with its obligation to protect the interests of the Federal Government, DOE may take such authorized actions as may be necessary to preserve the status quo pending decision by the SPE, or to preserve its ability to provide relief in the event the SPE decides in favor of the appellant.

        (f)  (1) The SPE shall have no jurisdiction to review

        (i) Any preaward dispute (except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section), including use of any special restrictive condition pursuant to § 600.114, § 600.212, or § 600.304;

        (ii) DOE denial of a request for a deviation under § 600.4, § 600.103, § 600.205, or § 600.303 of this part;

        (v) Any DOE decision about an action requiring prior DOE approval under § 600.144, § 600.236, or § 600.331 of this part or under another term or condition of the award;

        (2) In addition to any right of appeal established by program rule, or by the terms and conditions (not inconsistent with paragraph (f)(1) of this section) of an award, the Board shall have jurisdiction to review:

        (i) A DOE determination that the recipient has failed to comply with the applicable requirements of this part, the program statute or rules, or other terms and conditions of the award;

        (ii) A DOE decision not to make a continuation award based on any of the determinations described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section;

        (2) DOE may cancel the suspension at any time, up to and including the date of expiration of the period of suspension, if the awardee takes satisfactory corrective action before the expiration date of the suspension or gives DOE satisfactory evidence that such corrective action will be taken.

        (3) If the suspension has not been cancelled by the expiration date of the period of suspension, the awardee shall resume the suspended activities or project unless, prior to the expiration date, DOE notifies the awardee in writing that the period of suspension shall be extended consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that the award shall be terminated.

        (4) As of the effective date of the suspension, DOE shall withhold further payments and shall allow new obligations incurred by the awardee during the period of suspension only if such costs were authorized in the notice of suspension or in a subsequent letter.

        (5) If the suspension is cancelled or expires and the award is not terminated, DOE shall reimburse the awardee for any authorized allowable costs incurred during the suspension and, if necessary, may amend the award to extend the period of performance.

        § 600.30   Cost sharing.

#### § § 600.30

        In addition to the requirements of § 600.123, § 600.224, or § 600.313, the following requirements apply to research, development, demonstration and commercial application activities projects:

        (a) Cost sharing is required for most financial assistance awards for research, development, demonstration and commercial applications activities initiated after the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on August 8, 2005. This requirement does not apply to:

        (1) An award under the small business innovation research program or the small business technology transfer program; or

        (2) A program with cost sharing requirements defined by other than Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 including other sections of the 2005 Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

        (b) A cost share of at least 20 percent of the cost of the activity is required for research and development except where:

        (1) A research or development activity of a basic or fundamental nature has been excluded by an appropriate officer of the Department, generally an Under Secretary; or

        (2) The Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce or eliminate the cost sharing requirement for a research and development activity of an applied nature.

        (c) A cost share of at least 50 percent of the cost of a demonstration or commercial application program or activity is required unless the Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the cost sharing requirements, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity.

        (d) Cost share shall be provided by non-Federal funds unless otherwise authorized by statute. In calculating the amount of the non-Federal contribution:

        (1) Base the non-Federal contribution on total project costs, including the cost of work where funds are provided directly to a partner, consortium member or subrecipient, such as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center;

        (2) Include the following costs as allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles:

        (i) Cash;

        (ii) Personnel costs;

        § 600.31   Research misconduct.

#### § § 600.31

        (a) A recipient is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research of any kind under an award from DOE including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this section.

        (b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:

        means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.

        means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.

        means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.

        means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.

        means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.

        means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.

        means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

        means all basic, applied, and demonstration research in all fields of science, medicine, engineering, and mathematics, including, but not limited to, research in economics, education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social sciences statistics, and research involving human subjects or animals.

        means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

        means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.

        (c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:

        (1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;

        (2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).

        (3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.

        (d) The Department may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:

        (1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;

        (2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;

        (3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,

        (4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.

        (e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.

        (f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and the Department, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:

        (1)  The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.

        (2)  The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.

        (3)  The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.

        (4)  To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.

        (5)  If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.

        (g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.

        (h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.

For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required.

          means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible, having no physical existence, such as copyrights, patents, or securities.

          means written approval by a contracting officer evidencing prior consent.

          means land, including land improvements, structures and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment.

          means an organization receiving financial assistance directly from DOE to carry out a project or program. The term includes public and private institutions of higher education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and health centers. The term shall include commercial organizations which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of recipients or subrecipients. The term does not include government-owned contractor-operated facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-oriented, large-scale programs that are government-owned or controlled, or are designated as federally-funded research and development centers.

          means all research activities, both basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. “Research” is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.

          means a grant or cooperative agreement not exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000).

          means an action by DOE that temporarily withdraws DOE sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the DOE. _Suspension_ of an award is a separate action from suspension under DOE regulations implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (see 10 CFR part 1036).

          means the cancellation of DOE sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of completion.

          means the value of non-cash contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. _Third party in-kind contributions_ may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program.

          for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that have not been paid.

#### § § 600.102

          For awards subject to this subpart, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in § 600.4.

          § 600.103   Deviations.

#### § § 600.103

          The deviation provisions of § 600.4 apply to this subpart.

          § 600.104   Subawards.

#### § § 600.104

          Unless sections of this subpart specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, all DOE recipients, including State, local and Indian tribal governments, shall apply the provisions of this subpart to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals, or other non-profit organizations organizations. Thus, this subpart is applicable to those types of organizations regardless of the type of recipient receiving the primary award. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 600, subpart C, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.” For-profit subrecipients are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 600, subpart D, Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with For-Profit Organizations.

        Pre-Award Requirements

          § 600.110   Purpose.

#### § § 600.110

          Sections 600.111 through 600.117 prescribe forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for DOE awards.

          § 600.111   Pre-award policies.

#### § § 600.111

          (a)  In each instance, the DOE shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

          (b)  DOE will, whenever practical, notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.

          § 600.112   Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

#### § § 600.112

          (a)  An application for an award shall be on the form or in the format specified in a program rule or in the funding opportunity announcement. When a version of the Standard Form 424 is not used, DOE shall indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under Executive Order 12372.

          (b)  DOE may request and the applicant shall submit the minimum budgetary information necessary to evaluate the costs of the proposed project.

          (c) DOE may, subsequent to receipt of an application, request additional information from an applicant when necessary for clarification or to make informed preaward determinations.

          (d)  DOE may require that an application for a continuation or renewal award be made in the format or on the forms authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

          § 600.113   Debarment and suspension.

#### § § 600.113

          Recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension,” 2 CFR 180 and 901. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

          § 600.114   Special award conditions.

#### § § 600.114

          (a) If an applicant or recipient has a history of poor performance, is not financially stable, has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this subpart, has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or is not otherwise responsible, DOE may impose additional requirements as needed, without regard to the deviation provisions of § 600.4. Such applicant or recipient will be notified in writing as to the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action needed, and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions. Reconsideration of the additional requirements may be requested at any time. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.

          (b) A recipient may place a special restrictive condition, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in a subaward. In any such case, the recipient must notify DOE in writing within 15 days of the subaward. DOE shall decide whether to notify OMB and other interested parties.

          § 600.115   Metric system of measurement.

#### § § 600.115

          The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOE will follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.”

          § 600.116   Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

#### § § 600.116

          Under the Act (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

          § 600.117   [Reserved]

#### § § 600.117

        Post-Award Requirements

          § 600.120   Purpose of financial and program management.

#### § § 600.120

          Sections 600.121 through 600.128 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.

          § 600.121   Standards for financial management systems.

#### § § 600.121

          (a) Recipients shall relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical. For awards that support research, it should be noted that it is generally not appropriate to develop unit cost information.

          (b) Except for the provisions of 600.121(f) and 600.181, recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following:

          (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 600.152. If a DOE award requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for their reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

          (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.

          (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

          (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data. As discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, unit cost data is generally not appropriate for awards that support research.

          (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”

          (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

          (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.

          (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Contracting Officer, at his or her discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

          (d) The Contracting Officer may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

          (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described in §§ 600.121 (c) and (d), the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

          (f) Individuals whose financial management systems do not meet the minimum standards of § 600.121 (b) shall maintain a separate bank account for deposit of award or subaward funds. Disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient from this account shall be supported by source documentation such as canceled checks, paid bills, receipts, payrolls, etc.

          § 600.122   Payment.

#### § § 600.122

          (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.

          (b) Recipients will be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

          (1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and

          (2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in § 600.121. Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

          (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the DOE to the recipient.

          (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

          (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.

          (3) Recipients may submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.

          (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOE instructions for electronic funds transfer.

          (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOE may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.

          (1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOE shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

          (2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.

          (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOE has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOE may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, DOE advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the recipient's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOE reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment will not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

          (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

          (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOE will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply.

          (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or DOE reporting requirements.

          (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States. Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. Before withholding any payment, DOE shall notify the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date, which shall ordinarily be no sooner than 30 days from the date of the notice, until the recipient corrects the noncompliance or pays the indebtedness to the Federal government.

          (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.

          (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOE shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.

          (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

          (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).

          (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

          (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.

          (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.

          (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

          (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. The address is the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.

          (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

          (1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”

          (2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

          (n) The DOE may convert a recipient from advance payment to reimbursement whenever the recipient no longer meets the criteria for advance payment specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such conversion may be accomplished only after the DOE has advised the recipient in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and has provided a period of at least 30 days within which the recipient may take corrective action or provide satisfactory assurances of its intention to take such action.

          (o) With prior DOE approval and in accordance with written DOE instructions, a recipient may assign to a bank, trust company or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency, reimbursement by Treasury check due from DOE under the following conditions:

          (1) The award provides for reimbursement totaling $1,000 or more;

          (2) The assignment covers all amounts payable under the award that have not already been paid;

          (3) Reassignment is prohibited; and

          (4) The assignee files a written notice of award payment assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment with DOE. Any interest costs resulting from a loan obtained on the basis of an assignment are unallowable charges to DOE award funds or any required cost sharing.

          (p) Recipients shall observe the requirements of this section in making or withholding payments to subrecipients except that the forms used by recipients are not required to be used by subrecipients when requesting advances or reimbursement.

          § 600.123   Cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 600.123

          (a) All cost sharing or matching contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall meet all of the following criteria.

          (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.

          (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.

          (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.

          (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.

          (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.

          (6) Are provided for in the approved budget.

          (7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart, as applicable.

          (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching.

          (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If DOE authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

          (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.

          (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, DOE may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.

          (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

          (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.

          (f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

          (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if either paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.

          (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

          (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that DOE has approved the charges.

          (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.

          (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.

          (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.

          (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

          (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.

          (i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.

          (1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.

          (2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.

          (j) DOE shall specify in the solicitation or in the program rule, if any, any cost sharing requirement. The award document shall be specific as to whether the cost sharing is based on a minimum amount for the recipient or on a percentage of total costs.

          (k) If DOE requires that a recipient provide cost sharing which is not required by statute or which exceeds a statutory minimum, DOE shall state in the program rule or solicitation the reasons for requiring such cost sharing, recommended or required levels of cost sharing, and the circumstances under which the requirement for cost sharing may be waived or adjusted during any negotiation.

          (l) Whenever DOE negotiates the amount of cost sharing, DOE may take into account such factors as the use of program income (see § 600.124), patent rights, and rights in data. Foregone fee or profit shall not be considered in establishing the extent of cost sharing.

          § 600.124   Program income.

#### § § 600.124

          (a) The standards set forth in this section shall be used to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with DOE funds.

          (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the following ways.

          (1) Added to funds committed to the project and used to further eligible project objectives.

          (2) Used to finance the non-DOE share of the project.

          (3) Deducted from the total project allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the share of costs is based.

          (c) When DOE authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

          (d) In the event that the program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the award indicates another alternative in the terms and conditions, the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 600.114, or the recipient is a commercial organization.

          (e) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

          (f) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.

          (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 600.130 through 600.137).

          (h) Unless program regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. Chapter 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.

          § 600.125   Revision of budget and program plans.

#### § § 600.125

          (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It includes the sum of the Federal and non-Federal share when there are cost sharing requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.

          (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

          (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from the DOE for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.

          (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

          (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.

          (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

          (4) The need for additional Federal funding.

          (5) If required by program regulations, the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa.

          (6) The inclusion, unless waived by program regulations or the terms and conditions of award, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.

          (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

          (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.

          (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved in accordance with § 600.4.

          (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, program regulations may waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this subpart and its Appendices. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.

          (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award without prior approval or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of DOE. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).

          (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the final budget period of the project of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply.

          (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.

          (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.

          (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

          (iv) The extension is being exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the DOE in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.

          (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.

          (4) For awards that support research, unless the terms and conditions of award provide otherwise, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in § 600.125(e)(2) applies.

          (5) For continuation awards within a multiple year project in support of research, prior to receipt of continuation funding, preaward expenditures by recipients are not subject to the limitation or approval requirements of § 600.125(e)(1). Nevertheless, incurrence by the recipient does not impose any obligation on DOE if a continuation award is not subsequently made, or if an award is made for a lesser amount than the recipient expected.

          (f) Program regulations may restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which DOE's share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE. However, no program regulation shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.

          (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval.

          (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from the Contracting Officer for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

          (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.

          (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

          (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 600.127.

          (i) Except in accordance with the deviation procedures in 600.4 or as may be provided for in program regulations, no other prior approval requirements for specific items will be imposed by DOE.

          (j) When DOE makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, DOE may require the recipient to request prior approval from DOE before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

          (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify DOE in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.

          (l) Requests for budget revisions may be made by letter.

          (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, DOE shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, DOE shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

          (n) DOE approval or disapproval of a request for a budget or project revision shall be in writing and signed by a DOE Contracting Officer.

          (o) A request by a subrecipient for prior approval shall be addressed in writing to the recipient. The recipient shall promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing within 30 days from the date of the recipient's request for the revision. A recipient shall not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the DOE award. If the revision requested by the subrecipient would result in a change to the recipient's approved budget or approved project which requires DOE prior approval, the recipient shall obtain DOE approval before approving such revision.

          § 600.126   Non-Federal audits.

#### § § 600.126

          (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

          (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

          (c) For-profit organizations that are subrecipients are subject to the audit requirements specified in 10 CFR 600.316.

> [59 FR 53266, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45940, Aug. 29, 1997; 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003]

          § 600.127   Allowable costs.

#### § § 600.127

          (a)  For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.” The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.

          (b)  Unless restricted by Federal statute or program rule, DOE shall provide for the reimbursement of appropriate indirect costs.

          (1) DOE shall include an amount for indirect costs in an award only if the applicant requests reimbursement of such costs and—

          (i) Submits evidence that a cognizant Federal agency has been assigned to establish indirect cost rates for the applicant and indicates or provides evidence that—

          (A) A current agreement containing an applicable approved indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget period for which DOE may provide funding has been established; or

          (B) An indirect cost proposal has been submitted to the cognizant agency in order to establish an applicable approved indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget period for which DOE may provide funding; or

          (C) An indirect cost proposal covering all or part of the budget period and applicable to the activities for which DOE may provide funding will be submitted to the cognizant agency for approval no later than three months after the beginning date of the initial budget period of the DOE award or, for subsequent budget periods, in accordance with any schedule established by the cognizant agency; or

          (ii) If not assigned to a cognizant agency, the applicant includes, in the application, data that is current, complete, accurate, and sufficient to allow the Contracting Officer to determine a rate(s) for indirect costs. If the total approved budget will not exceed $100,000 or if the amount requested for indirect costs does not exceed $5,000, DOE may waive the requirement for negotiation of a rate and, in lieu thereof, provide a reasonable allowance for such costs.

          (2) Indirect cost proposals shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles and instructions from the cognizant agency or from DOE, as appropriate.

          (3) If a subaward under an award or subaward provides for the payment of indirect costs, the recipient or subrecipient shall be responsible for negotiating appropriate indirect costs, using the cost principles applicable to the subrecipient or contractor, unless the subrecipient or contractor has negotiated an applicable rate directly with DOE or another Federal department or agency. DOE may review and audit the procedures a recipient or subrecipient uses in conducting indirect cost negotiations.

          (c)  No increment above cost may be paid to a recipient or subrecipient under a DOE award or subaward. A fee or profit may be paid to a contractor providing goods or services under a contract with a recipient or subrecipient.

          § 600.128   Period of availability of funds.

#### § § 600.128

          Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the award only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by DOE.

          § 600.130   Purpose of property standards.

#### § § 600.130

          Sections 600.131 through 600.137 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government or whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients shall observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute or program regulations. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of §§ 600.131 through 600.137.

          § 600.131   Insurance coverage.

#### § § 600.131

          Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with DOE funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.

          § 600.132   Real property.

#### § § 600.132

          Unless otherwise provided by statute or program regulations, the requirements concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards are as follows.

          (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE.

          (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by DOE for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOE.

          (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE or its successor Federal awarding agency. DOE will give one or more of the following disposition instructions.

          (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

          (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOE and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

          (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

          § 600.133   Federally-owned and exempt property.

#### § § 600.133

          (a)  (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOE. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOE for further Federal agency utilization.

          (2) If DOE has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless DOE has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOE.

          (b)  When statutory authority exists, DOE may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOE considers appropriate. For example, under 31 U.S.C. 6306, DOE may so vest title to tangible personal property under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research. Such property is “exempt property.” Program regulations or the terms and conditions of award may establish provisions for vesting title to exempt property. Should such conditions not be established and the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE. If DOE does not issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of receipt of the request, title to the property shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. If, at the end of the project, DOE fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the receipt of a final inventory, title to the property shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

          § 600.134   Equipment.

#### § § 600.134

          (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.

          (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

          (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

          (1) Activities sponsored by DOE, then

          (2) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.

          (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by DOE that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by DOE. User charges shall be treated as program income.

          (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of DOE.

          (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.

          (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

          (i) A description of the equipment.

          (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.

          (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.

          (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

          (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

          (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

          (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

          (viii) Unit acquisition cost.

          (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates DOE for its share.

          (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

          (3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

          (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify DOE.

          (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

          (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

          (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. Equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE. DOE shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet DOE's requirements. If no requirement exists within DOE, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOE to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. DOE will issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.

          (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOE an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

          (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

          (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by DOE for such costs incurred in its disposition.

          (h) DOE reserves the right, at the end of a project, to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by DOE when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.

          (1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

          (2) DOE shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with award funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOE fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the provisions of § 600.134(g)(1) apply.

          (3) When DOE exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.

          § 600.135   Supplies and other expendable property.

#### § § 600.135

          (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

          (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.

          § 600.136   Intangible property.

#### § § 600.136

          (a) Recipients may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. DOE reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so.

          (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.”

          (c) The DOE has the right to:

          (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award; and

          (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

          (d)(1) In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the DOE shall request, and the recipient shall provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA. If the DOE obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency, the recipient, and applicable subrecipients. This fee is in addition to any fees the agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).

          (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph (d):

          (i)  is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples).  also do not include:

          (A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and

          (B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.

          (ii)  is defined as either when:

          (A) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or

          (B) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.

          (iii)  is defined as when an agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.

          (e) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of § 600.134(g).

> [61 FR 7165, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 14407, 14408, Mar. 16, 2000; 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003]

          § 600.137   Property trust relationship.

#### § § 600.137

          Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Recipients shall record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

          § 600.140   Purpose of procurement standards.

#### § § 600.140

          Sections 600.141 through 600.148 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by DOE upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or in accordance with the deviation procedures of § 600.4.

          § 600.141   Recipient responsibilities.

#### § § 600.141

          The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOE regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

          § 600.142   Codes of conduct.

#### § § 600.142

          The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

          § 600.143   Competition.

#### § § 600.143

          All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

          § 600.144   Procurement procedures.

#### § § 600.144

          (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.

          (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.

          (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement.

          (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.

          (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

          (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

          (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

          (iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.

          (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.

          (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.

          (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of DOE awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.

          (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.

          (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

          (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

          (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority- owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.

          (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

          (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.

          (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by DOE's implementation, in 10 CFR part 1036, of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”

          (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for DOE, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.

          (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this subpart.

          (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

          (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.

          (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.

          (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.

          (f) By agreement of the recipient or subrecipient and the contractor, if consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's usual business practices and applicable state and local law, any contract to which this section applies may provide for the payment of interest penalties on amounts overdue under such contract except that—

          (1) In no case shall any obligation to pay such interest penalties be construed to be an obligation of the Federal government, and

          (2) Any payment of such interest penalties may not be made from DOE funds nor be counted toward meeting a cost sharing requirement of a DOE award.

          § 600.145   Cost and price analysis.

#### § § 600.145

          Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.

          § 600.146   Procurement records.

#### § § 600.146

          Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:

          (a) Basis for contractor selection,

          (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and

          (c) Basis for award cost or price.

          § 600.147   Contract administration.

#### § § 600.147

          A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.

          § 600.148   Contract provisions.

#### § § 600.148

          The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.

          (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

          (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

          (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOE may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the DOE has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.

          (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

          (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

          (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

          (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

          (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOE, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

          (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of appendix A to this subpart, as applicable.

          § 600.149   Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

#### § § 600.149

          Recipients' procurements shall comply with applicable requirements of RCRA, as described at § 600.116 of this subpart.

          § 600.150   Purpose of reports and records.

#### § § 600.150

          Sections 600.151 through 600.153 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

          § 600.151   Monitoring and reporting program performance.

#### § § 600.151

          (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in § 600.126.

          (b) The terms and conditions of the award will prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOE may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.

          (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

          (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.

          (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.

          (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

          (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

          (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

          (f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOE of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

          (g) DOE may make site visits, as needed.

          (h) DOE shall comply with applicable clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.

          (i) Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on subawards consistent with the provisions of this section and shall require interim reporting in accordance with § 600.151(f).

          § 600.152   Financial reporting.

#### § § 600.152

          (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.

          (1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.

          (i) Recipients shall use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs, except that DOE has the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet DOE needs. However, a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.

          (ii) The terms and conditions of award shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. DOE may require accrual reporting only if such reporting is required by program statute or rule. If the award requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.

          (iii) DOE shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

          (iv) DOE shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the DOE upon request of the recipient.

          (2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.

          (i) When funds are advanced, each recipient shall submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. DOE will use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.

          (ii) Recipients shall forecast Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.

          (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOE may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.

          (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. DOE may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.

          (v) DOE may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:

          (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;

          (B) If, in the contracting officer's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,

          (C) When electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.

          (b) When DOE needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed:

          (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOE shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.

          (2) When DOE determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 600.121, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. DOE, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.

          (3) Contracting officers are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.

          (4) DOE may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.

          (5) Computer or electronic outputs may be provided to recipients when that expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.

          § 600.153   Retention and access requirements for records.

#### § § 600.153

          (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DOE shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients, unless such requirements are established in program regulations.

          (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by DOE. The only exceptions are the following:

          (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

          (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

          (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.

          (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and related records, for which retention requirements are specified in § 600.153(g).

          (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOE.

          (d) DOE shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOE may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.

          (e) DOE, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.

          (f) Unless required by statute, DOE shall place no restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOE can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to DOE.

          (g) Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

          (1)  If the recipient submits to the Federal agency responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.

          (2)  If the recipient is not required to submit to the cognizant Federal agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

          (h) If, by the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient or subrecipient—

          (1) Is accountable for program income earned or received after the end of the project period or after the termination of an award or subaward, or

          (2) If program income earned during the project period is required to be applied to costs incurred after the end of the project period or after termination of an award or subaward, the record retention period shall start on the last day of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which such income was earned or received or such costs were incurred. All other program income records shall be retained in accordance with § 600.153(b).

          § 600.160   Purpose of termination and enforcement.

#### § § 600.160

          Sections 600.161 and 600.162 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.

          § 600.161   Termination.

#### § § 600.161

          (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

          (1) By DOE, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

          (2) By DOE with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

          (3) By the recipient upon sending to DOE written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if DOE determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, it may terminate the award in its entirety under either paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.

          (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 600.171(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

          § 600.162   Enforcement.

#### § § 600.162

          (a)  If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, DOE may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 600.114, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.

          (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by DOE.

          (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

          (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

          (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

          (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

          (b)  In taking an enforcement action, DOE shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

          (c)  Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.

          (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

          (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

          (d)  The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.

          (c) DOE shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

          (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that DOE has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

          (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, DOE shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

          (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 600.131 through 600.137.

          (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOE shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

          § 600.172   Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

#### § § 600.172

          (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.

          (5) Records retention as required in § 600.153.

          (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of DOE and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in paragraph 600.173(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

          § 600.173   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 600.173

          (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, DOE may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section.

          (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.

          mean the charges incurred by the grantee during a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.

          means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the grantee.

          of an item of purchased equipment means the net invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular accounting practices.

          requirements mean those matters common to grants in general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, and retention of records. These are distinguished from  requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities that can be supported by grants under a particular program.

          means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.

          means the grantee's cash outlay, including the outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee cash contributions.

          means (except as used in the definitions for  and  in this section and except where qualified by ) a procurement contract under a _grant_ or _subgrant_, and means a procurement subcontract under a contract.

          means the value of the third party in-kind contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted project or program not borne by the Federal Government.

          means a contract or subcontract under a grant in which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs it incurs, with or without a fee.

          means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment provided that such definition would at least include all equipment defined above.

          means a State or local government or a federally recognized Indian tribal government.

          means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum award, which the grantee is not required to account for.

          means the government to which a grant is awarded and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document.

          means the United States Office of Management and Budget.

          (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.

          refers to a system under which payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.

          means documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific cost. For the Department of Energy, this must be signed by a Contracting Officer.

          when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be counted—not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.

          means any of the several _State_s of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 1937.

          means an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under a _grant_ by a grantee to an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of  in this subpart.

          means the government or other legal entity to which a subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use of the funds provided.

          means all tangible personal property other than “equipment” as defined in this subpart.

          means depending on the context, either (1) temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings as may ensue.

          means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise expire.

          mean all requirements of the grant or subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.

          mean property or services which benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.

        Pre-Award Requirements

          § 600.210   Forms for applying for grants.

#### § § 600.210

          (a)  (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.

          (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.

          (b)  (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

          (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and two copies of preapplications or applications.

          (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.

          (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously submitted pages with information that is still current need not be resubmitted.

          § 600.211   State plans.

#### § § 600.211

          (a)  The statutes for some programs require States to submit plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” States are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations implementing the Executive order.

          (b)  A State need meet only Federal administrative or programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified regulations.

          (c)  In each plan the State will include an assurance that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the plan, the State may:

          (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those provisions,

          (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or

          (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.

          (d)  A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.

          § 600.212   Special grant or subgrant conditions for “high-risk” recipients.

#### § § 600.212

          (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered “high risk” if an awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:

          (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or

          (2) Is not financially stable, or

          (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management standards set forth in this subpart, or

          (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or

          (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be included in the award.

          (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:

          (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;

          (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;

          (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;

          (4) Additional project monitoring;

          (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or management assistance; or

          (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.

          (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as possible, in writing, of:

          (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;

          (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;

          (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and

          (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/restrictions imposed.

        Post-Award Requirements

          § 600.220   Standards for financial management systems.

#### § § 600.220

          (a) A State must expend and account for grant funds in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to—

          (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the statutes authorizing the grant, and

          (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.

          (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and subgrantees must meet the following standards:

          (1)  Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or subgrant.

          (2)  Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.

          (3)  Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.

          (4)  Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.

          (5)  Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of costs.

          (6)  Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.

          (7)  Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.

          (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.

> [53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1992]

          § 600.221   Payment.

#### § § 600.221

          (a)  This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.

          (b)  Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.

          (c)  Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.

          (d)  Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.

          (e)  If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.

          (f)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments for the same activity.

          (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

          (g)  (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless—

          (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions or

          (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.

          (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 600.243(c).

          (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.

          (h)  (1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.

          (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement.

          (i)  Unless there are statutory provisions to the contrary, grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, remit to the Federal agency interest earned on advances. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses.

> [53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1992; 61 FR 7165, Feb. 26, 1996]

          § 600.222   Allowable costs.

#### § § 600.222

          (a)  Grant funds may be used only for:

          (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and

          (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.

          (b)  For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles.

> [53 FR 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 53 FR 8047, Mar. 11, 1988]

          § 600.223   Period of availability of funds.

#### § § 600.223

          (a)  Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from obligations of the subsequent funding period.

          (b)  A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the grantee.

          § 600.224   Matching or cost sharing.

#### § § 600.224

          (a)  With the qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following:

          (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-Federal third parties.

          (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.

          (b) —(1)  Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.

          (2)  For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds.

          (3)  Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds.

          (4)  Costs financed by program income, as defined in § 600.425, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in § 600.225(g).)

          (5)  Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.

          (6)  Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.

          (7)  (i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs.

          (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect costs. Cost sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the contributions.

          (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:

          (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or

          (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.

          (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this subpart. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable.

          (c) —(1)  Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.

          (2)  When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.

          (d)  (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.

          (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.

          (e)  If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:

          (1)  If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching,

          (2)  If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section apply:

          (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost-sharing or matching.

          (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in § 600.222, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.

          (f)  If a grantee or subgrantee donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

          (g)  In some cases under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

Program income includes income from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them.

          (b)  Program income means gross income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during the grant period. “During the grant period” is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the final financial report.

          (c)  If authorized by Federal regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income.

          (d)  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.

          (e)  Income from royalties and license fees for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See § 600.234.)

          (f)  Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment will be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 600.231 and 600.232.

          (g)  Program income shall be deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays.

          (1)  Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.

          (2)  When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.

          (3)  When authorized, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.

          (h)  There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.

          § 600.226   Non-Federal audit.

#### § § 600.226

          (a)  Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.

          (b)  State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:

          (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A-110, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;

          (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;

          (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;

          (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and

          (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.

          (c)  In arranging for audit services, § 600.236 shall be followed.

          § 600.230   Changes.

#### § § 600.230

          (a)  Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.

          (b)  The applicable cost principles (see § 600.222) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.

          (c) —(1)  Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:

          (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding.

          (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.

          (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).

          (2)  Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.

          (3)  When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.

          (d)  Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:

          (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).

          (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.

          (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.

          (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of § 600.236 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.

          (e)  The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (f)  (1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.

          (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see § 600.222) may be made by letter.

          (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.

          § 600.231   Real property.

#### § § 600.231

          (a)  Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

          (b)  Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.

          (c)  When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives:

          (1)  Retain title after compensating the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.

          (2)  Sell the property and compensate the awarding agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

          (3)  Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property to the current fair market value of the property.

          § 600.232   Equipment.

#### § § 600.232

          (a)  Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

          (b)  A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

          (c)  (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency.

          (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should be considered if appropriate.

          (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 600.225(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.

          (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency.

          (d)  Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:

          (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.

          (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

          (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be investigated.

          (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.

          (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.

          (e)  When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:

          (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.

          (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the equipment.

          (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.

          (f)  In the event a grantee or subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment:

          (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.

          (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory listing.

          (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal agency.

          (g)  The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the following standards:

          (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.

          (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the grantee shall follow § 600.232(e).

          (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.

          § 600.233   Supplies.

#### § § 600.233

          (a)  Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

          (b)  If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.

          § 600.234   Copyrights.

#### § § 600.234

          The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:

          (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or contract under a grant or subgrant; and

          (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a contractor purchases ownership with grant support.

          § 600.235   Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

#### § § 600.235

          Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension.”

          § 600.236   Procurement.

#### § § 600.236

          (a)  When procuring property and services under a grant, a State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.

          (b)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.

          (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

          (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:

          (i) The employee, officer or agent,

          (ii) Any member of his immediate family,

          (iii) His or her partner, or

          (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.

          (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.

          (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.

          (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.

          (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.

          (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.

          (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

          (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only—

          (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and

          (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.

          (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.

          (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:

          (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of this section (violations of State or local law will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and

          (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the grantee or subgrantee.

          (c)  (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of § 600.236. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:

          (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business,

          (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,

          (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies,

          (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts,

          (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,

          (vi) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and

          (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.

          (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.

          (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:

          (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and

          (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

          (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.

          (d)  (1) Procurement by  Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.

          (2) Procurement by  (formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in § 600.236(d)(2)(i) apply.

          (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:

          (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;

          (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively and for the business; and

          (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.

          (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:

          (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;

          (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;

          (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids;

          (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and

          (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.

          (3) Procurement by  The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:

          (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical;

          (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;

          (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting awardees;

          (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and

          (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.

          (4) Procurement by  is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

          (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:

          (A) The item is available only from a single source;

          (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;

          (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or

          (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

          (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required.

          (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

          (e)  (1) The grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.

          (2) Affirmative steps shall include:

          (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;

          (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;

          (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

          (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

          (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

          (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.

          (f)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.

          (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

          (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see § 600.422). Grantees may reference their own cost principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.

          (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.

          (g)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

          (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. when:

          (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or

          (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or

          (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a “brand name” product; or

          (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or

          (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.

          (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.

          (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.

          (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.

          (h)  For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:

          (1)  The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

          (2)  A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

          (3)  A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

          (i)  A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.

          (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the simplified acquisition threshold)

          (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)

          (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

          (4) Compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). (All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)

          (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)

          (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of $2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers)

          (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting.

          (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.

          (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data.

          (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

          (11) Retention of all required records for three years after grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.

          (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000).

          (13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 871).

          § 600.237   Subgrants.

#### § § 600.237

          (a)  States shall follow state law and procedures when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:

          (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;

          (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statute and regulation;

          (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with § 600.242 is placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and

          (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances by Federal agencies.

          (b)  All other grantees shall follow the provisions of this subpart which are applicable to awarding agencies when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. Grantees shall:

          (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance with this subpart;

          (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; and

          (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statutes and regulations.

> [53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated at 59 FR 53264, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996]

          § 600.240   Monitoring and reporting program performance.

#### § § 600.240

          (a)  Grantees are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, function or activity.

          (b)  The Federal agency may, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report.

          (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the Federal agency.

          (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:

          (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.

          (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not met.

          (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

          (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

          (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.

          (c)  For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, and never more frequently than quarterly.

          (d)  Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become known:

          (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

          (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.

          (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

          (f)  (1) Federal agencies may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.

          (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.

          § 600.241   Financial reporting.

#### § § 600.241

          (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:

          (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or

          (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit are not used.

          (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more burdensome requirements on subgrantees.

          (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for its decisionmaking purposes.

          (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of forms required under this subpart.

          (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.

          (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section if not needed.

          (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.

          (b) —(1)  Grantees will use Standard Form 269 or 269A, _Financial Status Report_, to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required in accordance with § 600.241(e)(2)(iii).

          (2)  Each grantee will report program outlays and program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the documentation on hand.

          (3)  The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the report for each project or program. However, the report will not be required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant support.

          (4)  When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support.

          (c) —(1)  (i) For grants paid by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, _Federal Cash Transactions Report_, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee from this requirement.

          (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the information to be submitted is not changed in substance.

          (2)  Forecasts of Federal cash requirements may be required in the “Remarks” section of the report.

          (3)  When considered necessary and feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess balances.

          (4)  Grantees must submit the report no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working days following the end of each month.

          (d) —(1)  Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee automatically on a predetermined basis.)

          (2)  Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)

          (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in § 600.441(b)(3).

          (e) —(1)  (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in § 600.241(d), instead of this form.

          (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated in § 600.241(b)(3).

          (2)  (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due date shall be governed by § 600.241(b) (3) and (4).

          (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be requested on the form specified in § 600.241(d).

          (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report specified in § 600.241(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

          (3)  The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by § 600.241(b)(2).

          § 600.242   Retention and access requirements for records.

#### § § 600.242

          (a)  (1) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:

          (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this subpart, program regulations or the grant agreement, or

          (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program regulations or the grant agreement.

          (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning records in certain kinds of contracts, see § 600.436(i)(10).

          (b)  (1) Except as otherwise provided, records must be retained for three years from the starting date specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.

          (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.

          (c)  (1)  When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.

          (2)  The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency.

          (3)  In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.

          (4)  This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

          (i)  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.

          (ii)  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

          (d)  Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records.

          (e) —(1)  The awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

          (2)  The rights of access in this section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are retained.

          (f)  The Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their records.

          § 600.243   Enforcement.

#### § § 600.243

          (a)  If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:

          (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency,

          (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance,

          (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program,

          (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or

          (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

          (b)  In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

          (c)  Costs of grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:

          (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,

          (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

          (d)  The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to “Debarment and Suspension” under E.O. 12549 (see § 600.235).

#### § § 600.244

          Except as provided in § 600.443 awards may be terminated in whole or in part only as follows:

          (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or

          (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either § 600.243 or paragraph (a) of this section.

          § 600.250   Closeout.

#### § § 600.250

          (a)  The Federal agency will close out the award when it determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant has been completed.

          (b)  Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include but are not limited to:

          (1)

          (2)

          (3)

          (4)

          (5)

          (c)  The Federal agency will, within 90 days after receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or downward adjustments to the allowable costs.

          (d)  (1) The Federal agency will make prompt payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.

          (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants.

          § 600.251   Later disallowances and adjustments.

#### § § 600.251

          The closeout of a grant does not affect:

          (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review;

          (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;

          (c) Records retention as required in § 600.242;

          (d) Property management requirements in §§ 600.231 and 600.232; and

          § 600.252   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 600.252

          (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by:

          (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for reimbursements,

          (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or

          (3) Other action permitted by law.

          (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

      Subpart D—Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements With For-Profit Organizations

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

        General

          § 600.301   Purpose.

#### § § 600.301

          (a) This subpart prescribes administrative requirements for awards to for-profit organizations.

          (b) Applicability to prime awards and subawards is as follows:

          (1)  DOE contracting officers must apply the provisions of this part to awards to for-profit organizations. Contracting officers must not impose requirements that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the requirements provided in this part, except:

          (i) In accordance with the deviation procedures or special award conditions in § 600.303 or § 600.304, respectively; or

          (ii) As required by Federal statute, Executive order, or Federal regulation implementing a statute or Executive order.

          (2)  (i) Any legal entity (including any State, local government, university or other nonprofit organization, as well as any for-profit entity) that receives an award from DOE must apply the provisions of this part to subawards with for-profit organizations.

          (ii) For-profit organizations that receive prime awards covered by this part must apply to each subaward the administrative requirements that are applicable to the particular type of subrecipient ( 10 CFR part 600, subpart B, contains requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, or other nonprofit organizations and 10 CFR part 600, subpart C, specifies requirements for subrecipients that are States or local governments).

          § 600.302   Definitions.

#### § § 600.302

          In addition to the definitions used in subpart A of this part, the following are definitions of terms as used in this subpart:

          means a payment made by Treasury check or other appropriate payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either before outlays are made by the recipient or through the use of predetermined payment schedules.

          means the total amount of Federal funds obligated by the Federal Government for use by the recipient. This amount may include any authorized carryover of unobligated funds from prior funding periods.

          means property in the possession of, or directly acquired by, the Government and subsequently made available to the recipient.

          means the period of time when Federal funding is available for obligation by the recipient.

          means the amount of orders placed, contracts and grants awarded, services received and similar transactions during a given period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a future period.

          means charges made to the project or program. They may be reported on cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees, and for other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required.

          It may be:

          (1) Tangible, having physical existence ( equipment and supplies); or

Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of them.

          means all allowable costs, as set forth in the applicable Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the value of the contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the objectives of the award during the project period.

          means real property and personal property (equipment, supplies, and intellectual property), unless otherwise stated.

          means land, including land improvements, structures and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment.

          means tangible, expendable personal property that is charged directly to the award and that has a useful life of less than one year or an acquisition cost of less than $5,000 per unit.

          means an action by DOE that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by DOE. _Suspension_ of an award is a separate action from suspension of a recipient under 10 CFR part 1036.

          means the cancellation of an award, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to either:

          (1) The date on which all work under an award is completed; or

          (2) The date on which Federal sponsorship ends, as provided in the award document or any supplement or amendment thereto.

          means the value of non-cash contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. _Third party in-kind contributions_ may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program.

          means the portion of the funds authorized by DOE that has not been obligated by the recipient and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds authorized.

          § 600.303   Deviations.

#### § § 600.303

          (a)  Individual deviations affecting only one award are subject to the procedures stated in 10 CFR 600.4

          § 600.304   Special award conditions.

#### § § 600.304

          (a) Contracting officers may impose additional requirements as needed, over and above those provided in this subpart, if an applicant or recipient:

          (1) Has a history of poor performance;

          (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this subpart;

          (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award; or

          (5) Is not otherwise responsible.

          (b) Before imposing additional requirements, DOE must notify the applicant or recipient in writing as to:

          (1) The nature of the additional requirements;

          (2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;

          (3) The nature of the corrective action needed;

          (5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.

          (c) The contracting officer must remove any special conditions if the circumstances that prompted them have been corrected.

          § 600.305   Debarment and suspension.

#### § § 600.305

          Recipients must comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implemented in 2 CFR 180 and 901. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

          § 600.306   Metric system of measurement.

#### § § 600.306

          (a) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 205) and implemented by Executive Order 12770, states that:

          (1) The metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce.

          (2) The metric system of measurement will be used, to the extent economically feasible, in Federal agencies' procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.

          (3) Metric implementation is not required if such use is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms.

          (b) Recipients are encouraged to use the metric system to the maximum extent practicable in measurement-sensitive activities and in measurement-sensitive outputs resulting from DOE funded programs.

        Post-Award Requirements

          § 600.310   Purpose of financial and program management.

#### § § 600.310

          Sections 600.311 through 600.318 prescribe standards for financial management systems; methods for making payments; and rules for cost sharing and matching, program income, revisions to budgets and program plans, audits, allowable costs, and fee and profit.

          § 600.311   Standards for financial management systems.

#### § § 600.311

          (a) Recipients are encouraged to use existing financial management systems to the extent that the systems comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the minimum standards in this section. At a minimum, a recipient's financial management system must provide:

          (1) Effective control of all funds. Control systems must be adequate to ensure that costs charged to Federal funds and those counted as the recipient's cost share or match are consistent with requirements for cost reasonableness, allowability, and allocability in the applicable cost principles ( § 600.317) and in the terms and conditions of the award.

          (2) Accurate, current and complete records that document, for each project funded wholly or in part with Federal funds, the source and application of the Federal funds and the recipient's required cost share or match. These records must:

          (i) Contain information about receipts, authorizations, assets, expenditures, program income, and interest.

          (ii) Be adequate to make comparisons of outlays with amounts budgeted for each award (as required for programmatic and financial reporting under § 600.341). Where appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.

          (3) To the extent that advance payments are authorized under § 600.312, procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the Government and the recipient's disbursement of the funds for program purposes.

          (4) A system to support charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages, whether treated as direct or indirect costs. If employees work on multiple activities or cost objectives, a distribution of their salaries and wages must be supported by personnel activity reports which:

          (i) Reflect an after the fact distribution of the actual activity of each employee.

          (ii) Account for the total activity for which each employee is compensated.

          (iii) Are prepared at least monthly, and coincide with one or more pay periods.

          (b) If the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, DOE, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

          (c) DOE may require adequate fidelity bond coverage if the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

          (d) If bonds are required in the situations described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

          § 600.312   Payment.

#### § § 600.312

          (a)  Payment methods for awards with for-profit organizations are:

          (1)  Under this method, the recipient requests reimbursement for costs incurred during a particular time period. In cases where the recipient submits requests for payment to the contracting officer, the DOE payment office reimburses the recipient by electronic funds transfer after approval of the request by the designated contracting officer.

          (2)  Under this method, DOE makes a payment to a recipient based upon projections of the recipient's cash needs. The payment generally is made upon the recipient's request, although predetermined payment schedules may be used when the timing of the recipient's needs to disburse funds can be predicted in advance with sufficient accuracy to ensure compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.

          (b)  (1) The preferred payment method is the reimbursement method, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

          (2) Advance payments, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may be used in exceptional circumstances, subject to the following conditions:

          (i) The contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, determines in writing that advance payments are necessary or will materially contribute to the probability of success of the project contemplated under the award ( as startup funds for a project performed by a newly formed company).

          (ii) Cash advances must be limited to the minimum amounts needed to carry out the program.

          (iii) Recipients and DOE must maintain procedures to ensure that the timing of cash advances is as close as is administratively feasible to the recipients' disbursements of the funds for program purposes, including direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

          (iv) Recipients must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing accounts, and remit annually the interest earned to the contracting officer for return to the Department of Treasury's miscellaneous receipts account, unless one of the following applies:

          (A) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.

          (B) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.

          (C) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that establishing an interest bearing account would not be feasible, given the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

          (c)  For either reimbursements or advance payments, recipients may submit requests for payment monthly, or more often if authorized by the contracting officer.

          (d)  DOE may authorize recipients to use the SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement;” the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs;” or prescribe other forms or formats as necessary.

          (e)  Payments normally will be made within 30 calendar days of the receipt of a recipient's request for reimbursement or advance by the office designated to receive the request, unless the billing is improper.

          (f)  Recipients must disburse funds available from program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, credits, discounts, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

          (g)  Unless otherwise required by statute, contracting officers may not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients during the project period for reasons other than the following:

          (1) A recipient failed to comply with project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements, in which case the contracting officer may suspend payments in accordance with § 600.352.

          (2) The recipient is delinquent on a debt to the United States ( definitions of “debt” and “delinquent debt” in 32 CFR 22.105). In that case, the contracting officer may, upon reasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient until the debt owed is resolved.

          § 600.313   Cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 600.313

          (a)  All contributions, including cash contributions and third party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching if such contributions meet all of the following criteria:

          (1) They are verifiable from the recipient's records.

          (2) They are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.

          (3) They are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.

          (4) They are allowable under § 600.317.

          (5) They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award unless authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.

          (6) They are provided for in the approved budget.

          (7) They conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.

          (b) —(1)  Values are established in accordance with the applicable cost principles in § 600.317, which means that amounts chargeable to the project are determined on the basis of costs incurred. For real property or equipment used on the project, the cost principles authorize depreciation or use charges. The full value of the item may be applied when the item will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully depreciated by the end of the award. In cases where the full value of a donated capital asset is to be applied as cost sharing or matching, that full value must be the lesser or the following:

          (i) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation; or

          (ii) The current fair market value. If there is sufficient justification, the contracting officer may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project. The contracting officer may accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the fair market value of the property.

          (2)  If an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, those services are valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits and overhead (at an overhead rate appropriate for the location where the services are performed), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.

          (3)  Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those markets in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

          (4)  (i) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies or laboratory supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share must be reasonable and must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

          (ii) Normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be applied. However, the fair rental charges for land and the full value of equipment or other capital assets may be allowed, when they will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully depreciated by the end of the award, provided that the contracting officer has approved the charges. When use charges are applied, values must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications:

          (A) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

          (B) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.

          (5)  The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties:

          (i) Volunteer services must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.

          (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal services and property must be documented.

          § 600.314   Program income.

#### § § 600.314

          (a) DOE must apply the standards in this section to the disposition of program income from projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.

          (b) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients, without any further accounting to DOE, may retain program income earned:

          (1) From license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award.

          (2) After the end of the project period.

          (c) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, costs incident to the generation of program income for which there is some obligation to the Government may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.

          (d) Other than any program income excluded pursuant to paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, program income earned during the project period must be retained by the recipient and used in one or more of the following ways, as specified in program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award:

          (1) Added to funds committed to the project by DOE and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.

          (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.

          (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.

          (e) If the program regulation or terms and conditions of an award authorize the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, and stipulate a limit on the amounts that may be used in those ways, program income in excess of the stipulated limits must be used in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

          (f) In the event that the program regulation or terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support basic or applied research, paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies automatically unless the terms and conditions specify another alternative or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 600.304.

          (g) Proceeds from the sale of property that is acquired, rather than fabricated, under an award are not program income and must be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 600.320 through 600.325 of this part.

          § 600.315   Revision of budget and program plans.

#### § § 600.315

          (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It includes the sum of the Federal and non-Federal shares when there are cost sharing requirements. The budget plan must be related to performance for program evaluation purposes, whenever appropriate.

          (b) The recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if a revision is necessary for either of the following two reasons:

          (1) A change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

          (2) A need for additional Federal funding.

          (c) The recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if a revision is necessary for any of the following six reasons, unless the requirement for prior approval is specifically waived in the program regulation or terms and conditions of the award:

          (1) A change in the approved project director, principal investigator, or other key person specified in the application or award document.

          (2) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

          (3) The inclusion of any additional costs that require prior approval in accordance with the applicable costs principles for Federal funds and the requirements applicable to the recipient's cost share or match, as provided in § 600.313 and § 600.317, respectively.

          (4) The inclusion of pre-award costs for periods greater than the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the effective date of the award.

          (5) A “no-cost” extension of the project period.

          (6) Any subaward, transfer, or contracting out of substantive program performance under an award, unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards.

          (d) If specifically required in the program regulation or the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval for the following revisions:

          (1) The transfer of funds among direct cost categories, functions, and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE.

          (2) For awards that provide support for both construction and nonconstruction work, any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

          (e) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the recipient's request for budget revisions, the contracting officer must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the contracting officer must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

          § 600.316   Audits.

#### § § 600.316

          (a) Any recipient that expends $500,000 or more in a year under Federal awards must have an audit made for that year by an independent auditor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If a recipient is currently performing under a Federal award that requires an audit by its Federal cognizant agency, that auditor must perform the independent audit. The audit generally should be made a part of the regularly scheduled, annual audit of the recipient's financial statements. However, it may be more economical in some cases to have Federal awards separately audited, and a recipient may elect to do so, unless that option is precluded by award terms and conditions or by Federal laws or regulations applicable to the program(s) under which the awards were made.

          (b) The auditor must determine and report on whether:

          (1) The recipient has an internal control structure that provides reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal awards in compliance with Federal laws and regulations and the terms and conditions of the awards.

          (2) Based on a sampling of Federal award expenditures, the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and award terms that may have a direct and material effect on Federal awards.

          (c) The recipient must make the auditor's report available to the DOE contracting officers whose awards are affected.

          (d) Before requesting an audit in addition to the independent audit, the contracting officer must:

          (1) Consider whether the independent audit satisfies his or her requirements;

          (2) Limit the scope of such additional audit to areas not adequately addressed by the independent audit; and

          (3) If DOE is not the Federal agency with the predominant fiscal interest in the recipient, coordinate with the agency that has the predominant fiscal interest.

          (e) The recipient and its Federal cognizant agency for audit should develop a coordinated audit approach to minimize duplication of audit work.

          (f) Audit costs (including a reasonable allocation of the costs of the audit of the recipient's financial statement, based on the relative benefit to the Government and the recipient) are allowable costs of DOE awards.

          § 600.317   Allowable costs.

#### § § 600.317

          (a) DOE determines allowability of costs in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the type of entity incurring the cost as follows:

          (1)  Allowability of costs incurred by for-profit organizations and those nonprofit organizations listed in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the for-profit costs principles in 48 CFR part 31 in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document.

          (2)  Allowability of costs incurred by other types of organizations that may be subrecipients under a prime award to a for-profit organization is determined as follows:

          (i)  Allowability is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.”

          (ii)  Allowability is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations.”

          (iii)  Allowability is determined in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with _Hospitals._”

          (iv)  Allowability for State, local, or federally recognized Indian tribal government is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.”

          (b)  If a recipient incurs pre-award costs without the prior approval of the contracting officer, DOE may pay those costs incurred within the ninety calendar day period immediately preceding the effective date of the award, if such costs are:

          (1) Necessary for the effective and economical conduct of the project;

          (2) Otherwise allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles; and

          (3) Less than the total value of the award.

          § 600.318   Fee and profit.

#### § § 600.318

          (a) Grants and cooperative agreements may not provide for the payment of fee or profit to recipients or subrecipients, except for awards made pursuant to the Small Business Innovation Research or Small Business Technology Transfer Research programs.

          (b) A recipient or subrecipient may pay a fee or profit to a contractor providing goods or services under a contract.

          § 600.320   Purpose of property standards.

#### § § 600.320

          Sections 600.321 through 600.325 set forth uniform standards for management, use, and disposition of property. DOE encourages recipients to use existing property-management systems to the extent that the systems meet these minimum requirements.

          § 600.321   Real property and equipment.

#### § § 600.321

          (a)  Recipients may purchase real property or equipment in whole or in part with Federal funds under an award only with the prior approval of the contracting officer.

          (b)  Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient subject to the conditions that the recipient:

          (1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project;

          (2) Not encumber the property without approval of the contracting officer; and

          (3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

          (c)  A recipient may offer the full value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching, subject to the requirements in § 600.313. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the Government has a financial interest in the property, ( a share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project). The property is considered as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section and to the provisions of § 600.323.

          (d)  Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with DOE funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.

          (e)  If real property or equipment is acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds under an award and the award does not specify that title vests unconditionally in the recipient, the real property or equipment is subject to the following:

          (1) During the time that the real property or equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient must make it available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:

          (i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

          (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

          (iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.

          (2) After Federal funding for the project ceases or if the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, insofar as:

          (i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used. If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the receipt must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

          (ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded, Federal award.

          (iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

          (f)  (1) If an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, the recipient has the following options:

          (i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.

          (ii) If the property that is no longer needed is equipment (rather than real property), the recipient may wish to replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment, subject to the approval of the contracting officer.

          (iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

          (iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.

          (2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:

          (i) For equipment (but not real property), consult with the DOE Project Director to determine whether the condition and nature of the equipment warrant excess screening within DOE. If screening is warranted, the equipment will be made available for reutilization within DOE through the Energy Asset Disposal System (EADS). If no DOE requirement is identified within a 30-day period, EADS automatically reports the availability of the equipment to the General Services Administration, to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies.

          (ii) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:

          (A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

          (B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.

          (3) If the responsible agency fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

          § 600.322   Federally owned property.

#### § § 600.322

          (a)  The recipient must submit annually to the contracting officer an inventory listing of all Federally owned property in its custody, i.e., property furnished by the Federal Government, rather than acquired by the recipient with Federal funds under the award.

          (b)  The recipient may not insure Federally owned property unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.

          (c)  (1) Use of federally owned property on other activities is permissible, if authorized by the contracting officer responsible for administering the award to which the property currently is charged.

          (2) Use on other activities must be in the following order of priority:

          (i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

          (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

          (iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.

          (d)  Upon completion of the award, the recipient must submit to the contracting officer a final inventory of Federal owned property. DOE may:

          (1) Use the property to meet another Federal Government need ( by transferring accountability for the property to another Federal award to the same recipient, or by directing the recipient to transfer the property to a Federal agency that needs the property or to another recipient with a currently funded award).

          (2) Declare the property to be excess property and either:

          (i) Report the property to the General Services Administration through EADS, in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services Administration regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or

          (ii) Dispose of the property by alternative methods, if there is authority under law, such as 15 U.S.C. 3710(i).

          § 600.323   Property management system.

#### § § 600.323

          The recipient's property management system must include the following:

          (a) Property records must be maintained, to include the following information for property that is Federally owned, equipment that is acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds, or property or equipment that is used as cost sharing or matching:

          (1) A description of the property.

          (2) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or any other identification number.

          (3) Source of the property, including the award number.

          (4) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

          (5) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

          (6) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property (not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government).

          (7) The location and condition of the property and the date the information was reported.

          (8) Ultimate disposition data, including data of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal Government for its share.

          (b) Federal owned equipment must be marked to indicate Federal ownership.

          (c) A physical inventory must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records must be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient must, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property.

          (d) A control system must be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of property must be investigated and fully documented. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, the recipient must promptly notify the Federal agency responsible for administering the property.

          (e) Adequate maintenance procedures must be implemented to keep the property in good condition.

          § 600.324   Supplies.

#### § § 600.324

          (a) Title vests in the recipient upon acquisition of supplies acquired with Federal funds under an award.

          (b) Upon termination or completion of the project or program, the recipient may retain any unused supplies. If the inventory of unused supplies exceeds $5,000 in total aggregate value and the items are not needed for any other Federally sponsored project or program, the recipient may retain the items for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share.

          § 600.325   Intellectual property.

#### § § 600.325

          (a)  This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement with DOE.

          (b)  In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.

          (c) —(1)  Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)—No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.

          (2)  Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:

          (i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;

          (ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or

          (iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.

          (3)  Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,  clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.

          (d)  (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data—General”.

          (2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.

          (3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,  DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.

          (e)  (1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.

          (2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.

          (f)  (1) If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data—SBIR Program”.

          (2) The data rights provisions for SBIR/STTR grants are contained in the award terms and conditions for SBIR grants located at  on the Professionals Homepage under Financial Assistance, Regulations and Guidance.

          (g)  (1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.

          (2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.

          (3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.

          § 600.330   Purpose of procurement standards.

#### § § 600.330

          Section 600.331 sets forth requirements necessary to ensure:

          (a) Recipients' procurements that use Federal funds comply with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and executive orders.

          (b) Proper stewardship of Federal funds used in recipients' procurements.

          § 600.331   Requirements.

#### § § 600.331

          The following requirements pertain to recipients' procurements funded in whole or in part with Federal funds or with recipients' cost-share or match:

          (a)  Recipients' procurement procedures must use best commercial practices to ensure reasonable cost for procured goods and services. Recipients are encouraged to buy commercial items, if practicable.

          (b)  If the contracting officer determines that there is a compelling need to perform a pre-award review of a specific transaction and the terms of the award identify the specific transaction and provide for such a review, then the recipient must obtain the contracting officer's approval prior to awarding the transaction and must provide the contracting officer the following documents to review:

          (1) Request for proposals or invitation to bid, if any;

          (2) Cost estimate;

          (3) Proposal/bid;

          (4) Proposed award document; and

          (5) Summary of negotiations or justification for award.

          (c)  (1) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

          (2) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must contain suitable provisions for termination for default by the recipient and for termination due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

          (3) All negotiated contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must include a provision permitting access of DOE, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific programs, for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, transcriptions, and copies of such documents.

          (4) All contracts, including those for amounts less than the simplified acquisition threshold, awarded by recipients and their contractors must contain the procurement provisions of Appendix B to this subpart, as applicable.

          (d)  The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOE, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. The recipient should refer matters concerning violations of statutes to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

          § 600.340   Purpose of reports and records.

#### § § 600.340

          Sections 600.341 and 600.342 prescribe requirements for monitoring and reporting financial and program performance and for records retention.

          § 600.341   Monitoring and reporting program and financial performance.

          (ii) The business portions of the reports must provide summarized details on the status of resources (Federal funds and non-Federal cost sharing or matching), including an accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award, explain any major deviations from those schedules, and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations.

          (2) A final technical report if the award is for research and development.

          (b) If the contracting officer previously authorized advance payments, pursuant to § 600.312(a)(2), he/she should consult with the DOE project director and consider whether program progress reported in the periodic progress report, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify continued authorization of advance payments.

          § 600.342   Retention and access requirements for records.

#### § § 600.342

          (a) This section sets forth requirements for records retention and access to records for awards to recipients and subrecipients.

          (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award must be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. The only exceptions are the following.

          (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

          (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

          (3) If records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.

          (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocation plans, and related records must be retained in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

          (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the contracting officer.

          (d) The contracting officer may request that recipients transfer certain records to DOE custody if he or she determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a contracting officer may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.

          (e) DOE, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but must last as long as records are retained.

          (f) Unless required by statute, DOE must not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOE can demonstrate that such records would be kept confidential and would be exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records belonged to DOE.

          (g) Indirect cost proposals, cost allocation plans, and other cost accounting documents (such as documents related to computer usage chargeback rates), along with their supporting records, must be retained for a 3-year period, as follows:

          (1) If the recipient or the subrecipient is required to submit an indirect-cost proposal, cost allocation plan, or other computation to the cognizant Federal agency for purposes of negotiating an indirect cost rate or other rates, the 3-year retention period starts on the date of the submission.

          (2) If the recipient or the subrecipient is not required to submit the documents or supporting records for negotiating an indirect cost rate or other rates, the 3-year retention period for the documents and records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

          (h) If the information described in this section is maintained on a computer, recipients must retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Recipients may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Recipients' computer data retention and transfer procedures must maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Recipients must also maintain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed in this section, recipients must not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.

          § 600.350   Purpose of termination and enforcement.

#### § § 600.350

          Sections 600.351 through 600.353 set forth uniform procedures for suspension, termination, enforcement, and disputes.

          § 600.351   Termination.

#### § § 600.351

          (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only in accordance with one of the following:

          (1) By the contracting officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

          (2) By the contracting officer with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

          (3) By the recipient upon sending to the contracting officer written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. The recipient must provide such notice at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, if the contracting officer determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, he or she may terminate the award in its entirety.

          (b) If the recipient incurred allowable costs prior to the termination, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 600.361(b), including those related to property, apply to the termination of the award, and provision must be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

          § 600.352   Enforcement.

#### § § 600.352

          (a)  If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the contracting officer may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 600.304, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:

          (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the contracting officer.

          (2) Disallow (that is, deny both the use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

          (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

          (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

          (5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.

          (b)  In taking an enforcement action, DOE must provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

          (c)  Costs resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable, unless the contracting officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently authorizes such costs. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination, which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable, are allowable if the costs:

          (1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and

          (2) Would be allowable if the award expired normally at the end of the funding period.

          (d)  The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.

          § 600.353   Disputes and appeals.

#### § § 600.353

          Consistent with 10 CFR 600.22 and part 1024, recipients have the right to appeal certain decisions by contracting officers.

#### § § 600.361

          (a) Recipients must submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all reports required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOE may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

          (b) The following provisions must apply to the closeout:

          (1) Unless DOE authorizes an extension, a recipient must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion of the award as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.

          (5) The recipient must account for any real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 600.321 through 600.325.

          (6) If a final audit is required and has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOE retains the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

          § 600.362   Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

          (4) Property management requirements in §§ 600.321 through 600.325.

          (5) Records retention requirements in § 600.342.

          (b) After closeout of an award, the continuing responsibilities under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the contracting officer and the recipient, provided property management requirements are considered and provisions made for the continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

          § 600.363   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 600.363

          (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within 30 days after the demand for payment, DOE may reduce the debt in accordance with the procedures and techniques described in 10 CFR part 1015 and OMB Circular A-129, including:

          (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.

          § 600.381   Special provisions for Small Business Innovation Research Grants.

#### § § 600.381

          (a)  This section contains provisions applicable to the Small Business Innovation Reserach (SBIR) Program.

          (b)  Phase I SBIR awards may be made on a fixed obligation basis, subject to the following requirements.

          (1) While proposed costs must be analyzed in detail to ensure consistency with applicable cost principles, incurred costs are not subject to review under the standards of cost allowability.

          (c)  Phase II SBIR awards may be made for a single budget period of 24 months.

          (d)  (1) The prior approval of the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer is required before the final budget period of the project period may be extended without additional funds.

          (2) A fee or profit may be paid to SBIR recipients.

      Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

        § 601.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 601.200

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

        (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

        (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

        (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

        (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

        (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

        (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

        (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

        (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

        § 601.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 601.205

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

        § 601.210   Reporting.

#### § § 601.210

        No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

      Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

        § 601.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 601.300

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) The reporting requirements in § 601.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

        (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

        § 601.400   Penalties.

#### § § 601.400

        (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited by this part shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,132 and not more than $251,322 for each such expenditure.

        (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B to this part) to be filed or amended if required by this part, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,132 and not more than $251,322 for each such failure.

        (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

        (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

        (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $25,132, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $25,132 and $251,322, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

        (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 602.14   Fee.

#### § § 602.14

      (a) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, a fee may be paid, in appropriate circumstances, to a recipient that is a small business concern, as qualified under the criteria and size standards of 13 CFR part 121, in order to permit the concern to participate in the Epidemiology and Other Health Studies Financial Assistance Program. Whether or not it is appropriate to pay a fee shall be determined by the contracting officer, who shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines:

      (1) Whether the acceptance of an award will displace other work that the small business is currently engaged in or committed to assume in the near future; or

      (2) Whether the acceptance of an award will, in the absence of paying a fee, cause substantial financial distress to the business. In evaluating financial distress, the contracting officer shall balance current displacement against reasonable future benefit to the company. (If the award will result in the beneficial expansion of the existing business base of the company, then no fee would generally be appropriate.) Fees shall not be paid to other entities except as a deviation from 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, nor shall fees be paid under awards in support of conferences.

      (b) To request a fee, a small business concern shall submit with its application a written self-certification that it is a small business concern qualified under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. In addition, the application must state the amount of fee requested for the entire project period and the basis for requesting the amount and must also state why payment of a fee by DOE would be appropriate.

      (c) If the contracting officer determines that payment of a fee is appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of fee shall be that determined to be reasonable by the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines in determining the fee amount:

      (1) The fee base shall include the estimated allowable cost of direct salaries and wages and allocable fringe benefits. This fee base shall exclude all other direct and indirect costs.

      (2) The fee amount expressed as a percentage of the appropriate fee base, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall not exceed the percentage rate of fee that would result if a Federal agency contracted for the same amount of salaries, wages, and allocable fringe benefits under a cost reimbursement contract.

      (3) Fee amounts, determined pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, shall be appropriately reduced when:

      (i) Advance payments are provided; and/or

      (ii) Title to property acquired with DOE funds vests in the recipient (2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910).

      (d) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, any fee awarded shall be a fixed fee and shall be payable on an annual basis in proportion to the work completed, as determined by the contracting officer, upon satisfactory submission and acceptance by DOE of the progress report. If the project period is shortened due to termination, or the project period is not fully funded, the fee shall be reduced by an appropriate amount.

#### § § 602.15

      Awards issued under this part for conferences and scientific/technical meetings will not include payment for indirect costs.

      § 602.16   National security.

#### § § 602.16

      Activities under the Epidemiology and Other Health Studies Financial Assistance Program are not expected to involve classified information (i.e., Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information). However, if in the opinion of the recipient or DOE such involvement becomes expected prior to the closeout of the award, the recipient or DOE shall notify the other in writing immediately. If the recipient believes any information developed or acquired may be classified, the recipient shall not provide the potentially classified information to anyone, including DOE officials with whom the recipient normally communicates, except the Director, Office of Classification, and shall protect such information as if it were classified until notified by DOE that a determination has been made that it does not require such handling. Correspondence that includes the specific information in question shall be sent by registered mail to the U.S. Department of Energy, Attn: Director, Office of Classification, EHSS-60, P.O. Box A, Germantown, MD 20875. If the information is determined to be classified, the recipient may wish to discontinue the project, in which case the recipient and DOE shall terminate the award by mutual agreement. If the award is to be terminated, all material deemed by DOE to be classified shall be forwarded to DOE in a manner specified by DOE for proper disposition. If the recipient and DOE wish to continue the award, even though classified information is involved, the recipient shall be requested to obtain both personnel and facility security clearances through the Office of Headquarters Security Operations awards or from the cognizant field office for awards obtained through DOE field organizations. Costs associated with handling and protecting any such classified information shall be negotiated at the time that the determination to proceed is made.

#### § § 602.17

      (a) A recipient shall periodically report to DOE on the project's progress in meeting the project objectives of the award. The following types of reports shall be used:

      (1)  After issuance of an initial award, recipients must submit a satisfactory progress report to receive a continuation award for the remainder of the project period. The original and two copies of the required report must be submitted to the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security program manager 90 days prior to the anticipated continuation funding date. The report should include results of work to date and emphasize findings and their significance to the field, and any real or anticipated problems. The report also should contain the following information: On the first page, provide the project title, principal investigator/project director name, period of time the report covers, name and address of recipient organization, DOE award number, the amount of unexpended funds, if any, that are anticipated to be left at the end of the current budget period. If the amount exceeds 10 percent of the funds available for the budget period, provide information as to why the excess funds are anticipated to be available and how they will be used in the next budget period. The report should state whether the aims have changed from the original application, and if they have, provide revised aims. A completed budget page must be submitted with the continuation progress report when a change to anticipated future costs will exceed 25 percent of the original recommended future budget.

      (2)  A Notice of Energy R&D Project, DOE Form 1430.22, which summarizes the purpose and scope of the project, must be submitted in accordance with the Distribution and Schedule of Documents set forth in appendix A to this part, Schedule of Renewal Applications and Reports. Copies of the form may be obtained from a DOE contracting office.

      (3)  The recipient shall report the following events to DOE as soon after they occur as possible:

      (i) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially affect the ability to attain project objectives or prevent the meeting of time schedules and goals. The report must describe remedial action that the recipient has taken, or plans to take, and any action DOE should take to alleviate the problems.

      (ii) Favorable developments or events that enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner, or a lower cost than anticipated, or producing more beneficial results than originally projected.

      (4)  A final report covering the entire project must be submitted by the recipient within 90 days after the project period ends or the award is terminated. Satisfactory completion of an award will be contingent upon the receipt of this report. The final report shall follow the same outline as progress reports. Recipients will provide, as part of the final report, a description of records and data compiled during the project, along with a plan for its preservation or disposition (see § 602.19 of this part). All manuscripts prepared for publication should be appended to the final report.

      (5)  The FSR is required within 90 days after completion of each budget period. For budget periods exceeding 12 months, an FSR is also required within 90 days after this first 12 months unless waived by the contracting officer.

      (b) DOE may extend the deadline date for any report if the recipient submits a written request before the deadline, that adequately justifies an extension.

      (c) A table summarizing the various types of reports, time for submission, and number of copies is set forth in appendix A to this part. The schedule of reports shall be as prescribed in this table, unless the award document specifies otherwise. These reports shall be submitted by the recipient to the awarding office.

      (d) DOE, or its authorized representatives, may make site visits, at any reasonable time, to review the project. DOE may provide such technical assistance as may be requested.

      (e) Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on a subrecipient consistent with the provisions of this section.

      § 602.18   Dissemination of results.

#### § § 602.18

      (a) Recipients are encouraged to disseminate research results promptly. DOE reserves the right to utilize, and have others utilize to the extent it deems appropriate, the reports resulting from research awards.

      (b) DOE may waive the technical reporting requirement of progress reports set forth in § 602.17, if the recipient submits to DOE a copy of its own report that is published or accepted for publication in a recognized scientific or technical journal and that satisfies the information requirements of the program.

      (c) Recipients are urged to publish results through normal publication channels.

      (d) The article shall include an acknowledgement that the project was supported, in whole or in part, by a DOE award, and specify the award number, but state that such support does not constitute an endorsement by DOE of the views expressed in the article.

      § 602.19   Records and data.

#### § § 602.19

      (a) In some cases, DOE will require submission of certain project records or data to facilitate mission-related activities. Recipients, therefore, must take adequate steps to ensure proper management, control, and preservation of all project records and data.

      (b) Awardees must ensure that all project data is adequately documented. Documentation shall:

      (1) Reference software used to compile, manage, and analyze data;

      (2) Define all technical characteristics necessary for reading or processing the records;

      (3) Define file and record content and codes;

Whether or not it is appropriate to pay a fee shall be determined by the Contracting Officer who shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines:

      (1) Whether the acceptance of an award will displace other work the small business is currently engaged in or committed to assume in the near future; or

      (2) Whether the acceptance of an award will, in the absence of paying a fee, cause substantial financial distress to the business. In evaluating financial distress, the Contracting Officer shall balance current displacement against reasonable future benefit to the company. (If the award will result in the beneficial expansion of the existing business base of the company, then no fee would generally be appropriate.) Fees shall not be paid to other entities except as a exceptionfrom 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, nor shall fees be paid under awards in support of conferences.

      (b) To request a fee, a small business concern shall submit with its application a written self certification that it is a small business concern qualified under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. In addition, the application must state the amount of fee requested for the entire project period and the basis for requesting the amount, and must also state why payment of a fee by DOE would be appropriate.

      (c) If the Contracting Officer determines that payment of a fee is appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of fee shall be that determined to be reasonable by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines in determining the fee amount:

      (1) The fee base shall include the estimated allowable cost of direct salaries and wages and allocable fringe benefits. This fee base shall exclude all other direct and indirect costs.

      (2) The fee amount expressed as a percentage of the appropriate fee base pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall not exceed the percentage rate of fee that would result if a Federal agency contracted for the same amount of salaries, wages, and allocable fringe benefits under a cost reimbursement contract.

      (3) Fee amounts, determined pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, shall be appropriately reduced when:

      (i) Advance payments are provided; and/or

      (ii) Title to property acquired with DOE funds vests in the recipient (10 CFR part 600).

      (d) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, any fee awarded shall be a fixed fee and shall be payable on an annual basis in proportion to the work completed, as determined by the Contracting Officer, upon satisfactory submission and acceptance by DOE of the progress report. If the project period is shortened due to termination, or the project period is not fully funded, the fee shall be reduced by an appropriate amount.

      Activities under SC's Financial Assistance Program shall not involve classified information (i.e., Restricted Data, formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information). However, if in the opinion of the recipient or DOE such involvement becomes expected prior to the closeout of the award, the recipient or DOE shall notify the other in writing immediately. If the recipient believes any information developed or acquired may be classifiable, the recipient shall not provide the potentially classifiable information to anyone, including the DOE officials with whom the recipient normally communicates, except the Director of Classification, and shall protect such information as if it were classified until notified by DOE that a determination has been made that it does not require such handling. Correspondence which includes the specific information in question shall be sent by registered mail to U.S. Department of Energy, Attn: Director of Classification, DP-32, Washington, DC 20585. If the information is determined to be classified, the recipient may wish to discontinue the project in which case the recipient and DOE shall terminate the award by mutual agreement. If the award is to be terminated, all material deemed by DOE to be classified shall be forwarded to DOE, in a manner specified by DOE, for proper disposition. If the recipient and DOE wish to continue the award, even though classified information is involved, the recipient shall be required to obtain both personnel and facility security clearances through the Office of Safeguards and Security for Headquarters awards, or from the cognizant field office Division of Safeguards and Security for awards obtained through DOE field organizations.

      § 609.14   Full faith and credit and incontestability.

#### § § 609.14

      The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of principal and interest of Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to Guarantees issued in accordance with Title XVII and this part. The issuance by DOE of a Guarantee shall be conclusive evidence that it has been properly obtained; that the underlying loan qualified for such Guarantee; and that, but for fraud or material misrepresentation by the Holder, except when the Holder is the Federal Financing Bank, such Guarantee shall be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable against DOE in accordance with its terms.

      § 609.15   Default, demand, payment, and foreclosure on collateral.

#### § § 609.15

      (a) If a Borrower defaults in making a required payment of principal or interest on a Guaranteed Obligation and such default has not been cured within the applicable grace period, the Holder may make written demand for payment upon the Secretary in accordance with the terms of the applicable Guarantee. If a Borrower defaults in making a required payment of principal or interest on a Guaranteed Obligation and such default has not been cured within the applicable grace period, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General.

      (b) Subject to the terms of the applicable Guarantee, the Secretary shall make payment within 60 days after receipt of written demand for payment from the Holder, provided that the demand for payment complies in all respects with the terms of the applicable Guarantee. Interest shall accrue to the Holder at the rate stated in the promissory note evidencing the Guaranteed Obligation, without giving effect to the Borrower's default in making a required payment of principal or interest on the applicable Guarantee Obligation or any other default by the Borrower, until the Guaranteed Obligation has been fully paid by DOE. Payment by the Secretary on the applicable Guarantee does not change Borrower's obligations under the promissory note evidencing the Guaranteed Obligation, Loan Guarantee Agreement, Loan Agreement, or related documents, including an obligation to pay default interest.

      (c) Following payment by the Secretary pursuant to the applicable Guarantee, upon demand by DOE, the Holder shall transfer and assign to the Secretary (or his or her designee or agent) the promissory note evidencing the Guaranteed Obligation, all rights and interests of the Holder in the Guaranteed Obligation, and all rights and interests of the Holder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation, except to the extent that the Secretary determines that such promissory note or any of such rights and interests shall not be transferred and assigned to the Secretary. Such transfer and assignment shall include, without limitation, all of the liens, security, and collateral rights of the Holder (or his or her designee or agent) in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation.

      (d) Following payment by the Secretary pursuant to a Guarantee or other default of a Guaranteed Obligation, the Secretary is authorized to protect and foreclose on the collateral, take action to recover costs incurred by, and all amounts owed to, the United States as a result of the defaulted Guarantee Obligation, and take such other action necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. In respect of any such authorized actions that involve a judicial proceeding or other judicial action, the Secretary shall act through the Attorney General. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph (d) shall not relieve the Secretary from his or her obligations pursuant to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph (d) shall limit the Secretary from exercising any rights or remedies pursuant to the terms of the Loan Guarantee Agreement.

      (e) The cash proceeds received as a result of any foreclosure on the collateral, or other action, shall be distributed in accordance with the Loan Guarantee Agreement (subject to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement).

      (f) The Loan Guarantee Agreement shall provide that cash proceeds received by the Secretary (or his or her designee or agent) as a result of any foreclosure on the collateral or other action shall be applied in the following order of priority:

      (1) Toward the pro rata payment of any costs and expenses (including unpaid fees, fees and expenses of counsel, contractors and agents, and liabilities and advances made or incurred) of the Secretary, the Attorney General, the Holder, a collateral agent, or other responsible person of any of them (solely in their individual capacities as such and not on behalf of or for the benefit of their principals), incurred in connection with any authorized action following payment by the Secretary pursuant to a Guarantee or other default of a Guaranteed Obligation, or as otherwise permitted under the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement;

      (2) To pay all accrued and unpaid fees due and payable to the Secretary, the Attorney General, the Holder, a collateral agent, or other responsible person of any of them on a pro rata basis in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation;

      (3) To pay all accrued and unpaid interest due and payable to the Secretary, the Attorney General, the Holder, a collateral agent, or other responsible person of any of them on a pro rata basis in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation;

      (4) To pay all unpaid principal of the Guaranteed Obligation;

      (5) To pay all other obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the Loan Agreement, and related documents that are remaining after giving effect to the preceding provisions and are then due and payable; and

      (6) To pay to the Borrower, or its successors and assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, any cash proceeds then remaining following the application of all payment described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.

      (g) No action taken by the Holder or its agent or designee in respect of any collateral will affect the rights of any person, including the Secretary, having an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations or other debt obligations, to pursue, jointly or severally, legal action against the Borrower or other liable persons, for any amounts owing in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation or other applicable debt obligations.

      (h) In the event that the Secretary considers it necessary or desirable to protect or further the interest of the United States in connection with exercise of rights as a lien holder or recovery of deficiencies due under the Guaranteed Obligation, the Secretary may take such action as he determines to be appropriate under the circumstances.

      (i) Nothing in this part precludes, nor shall any provision of this part be construed to preclude, the Secretary from purchasing any collateral or Holder's or other Person's interest in the Eligible Project upon foreclosure of the collateral.

      (j) Nothing in this part precludes, nor shall any provision of this part be construed to preclude, forbearance by any Holder with the consent of the Secretary for the benefit of the Borrower and the United States.

      (k) The Holder and the Secretary may agree to a formal or informal plan of reorganization in respect of the Borrower, to include a restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligation and other applicable debt of the Borrower on such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines are in the best interest of the United States.

      § 609.16   Preservation of collateral.

#### § § 609.16

      (a) If the Secretary exercises his or her right under the Loan Guarantee Agreement to require the holder of pledged collateral to take such actions as the Secretary (subject to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably require to provide for the care, preservation, protection, and maintenance of such collateral so as to enable the United States to achieve maximum recovery from the collateral, the Secretary shall, subject to compliance with the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341  reimburse the holder of such collateral for reasonable and appropriate expenses incurred in taking actions required by the Secretary (unless otherwise provided in applicable agreements). Except as provided in § 609.15, no party may waive or relinquish, without the consent of the Secretary, any such collateral to which the United States would be subrogated upon payment under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.

      (b) In the event of a default, the Secretary may enter into such contracts as he determines are required or appropriate, taking into account the term of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, to care for, preserve, protect or maintain collateral pledged in respect of Guaranteed Obligations. The cost of such contracts may be charged to the Borrower.

      § 609.17   Audit and access to records.

#### § § 609.17

      Each Loan Guarantee Agreement and related documents shall provide that:

      (a) The Eligible Lender, or DOE in conjunction with the Federal Financing Bank where loans are funded by the Federal Financing Bank or other Holder or other party servicing the Guaranteed Obligations, as applicable, and the Borrower, shall keep such records concerning the Eligible Project as are necessary, including the Application, Term Sheet, Conditional Commitment, Loan Guarantee Agreement, Credit Agreement, mortgage, note, disbursement requests and supporting documentation, financial statements, audit reports of independent accounting firms, lists of all Eligible Project assets and non-Eligible Project assets pledged in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, all off-take and other revenue producing agreements, documentation for all Eligible Project indebtedness, income tax returns, technology agreements, documentation for all permits and regulatory approvals, and all other documents and records relating to the Borrower or the Eligible Project, as determined by the Secretary, to facilitate an effective audit and performance evaluation of the Eligible Project; and

      (b) The Secretary and the Comptroller General, or their duly authorized representatives, shall have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the Borrower, Eligible Lender, or DOE or other Holder or other party servicing the Guaranteed Obligation, as applicable. Such inspection may be made during regular office hours of the Borrower, Eligible Lender, DOE or other Holder, or other party servicing the Eligible Project and the Guaranteed Obligations, as applicable, or at any other time mutually convenient.

      § 609.18   Deviations.

#### § § 609.18

      (a) Subject to the requirements of Title XVII and as otherwise permitted by applicable law, the Secretary may authorize deviations from the requirements of this part upon:

      (1) Either receipt from the Applicant, Borrower, or Project Sponsor, as applicable, of—

      (i) A written request that the Secretary deviate from one or more requirements; and

      (ii) A supporting statement briefly describing one or more justifications for such deviation; or

        § 611.106   Environmental requirements.

#### § § 611.106

        (a)(1)  Environmental review of the proposed projects under this part will be conducted in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders.

        (2) The applicant must submit a comprehensive environmental report. The comprehensive environmental report shall consist of the specific reports and related material set forth in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.

        (3) The regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality implementing NEPA require DOE to provide public notice of the availability of project specific environmental documents such as environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, findings of no significant impact, records of decision etc., to the affected public. See 40 CFR 1506.6(b). The comprehensive environmental report will provide substantial basis for any required environmental impact statement or environmental assessment and findings of no significant impact, pursuant to the procedures set forth in 10 CFR 1021.215. DOE may also make a determination as to whether a categorical exclusion is available with regard to an Application.

        (b) The detail of each specific report must be commensurate with the complexity of the proposal and its potential for environmental impact. Each topic in each specific report shall be addressed or its omission justified, unless the specific report description indicates that the data is not required for that type of project. If material required for one specific report is provided in another specific report or in another exhibit, it may be incorporated by reference. If any specific report topic is required for a particular project but is not provided at the time the application is filed, the comprehensive environmental report shall explain why it is missing and when the applicant anticipates it will be filed.

        (c) As appropriate, each specific report shall:

        (1) Address conditions or resources that might be directly or indirectly affected by the project;

        (2) Identify significant environmental effects expected to occur as a result of the project;

        (5) Provide a list of publications, reports, and other literature or communications that were cited or relied upon to prepare each report.

        (d) Specific Report 1—Project impact and description. This report must describe the environmental impacts of the project, facilities associated with the project, special construction and operation procedures, construction timetables, future plans for related construction, compliance with regulations and codes, and permits that must be obtained.

        (e) Specific Report 2—Socioeconomics. This report must identify and quantify the impacts of constructing and operating the proposed project on factors affecting towns and counties in the vicinity of the project. The report must:

        (1) Describe the socioeconomic impact area;

        (2) Evaluate the impact of any substantial immigration of people on governmental facilities and services and plans to reduce the impact on the local infrastructure;

        (3) Describe on-site manpower requirements and payroll during construction and operation, including the number of construction personnel who currently reside within the impact area, would commute daily to the site from outside the impact area, or would relocate temporarily within the impact area;

        (4) Determine whether existing housing within the impact area is sufficient to meet the needs of the additional population;

        (5) Describe the number and types of residences and businesses that would be displaced by the project, procedures to be used to acquire these properties, and types and amounts of relocation assistance payments; and

        (6) Conduct a fiscal impact analysis evaluating incremental local government expenditures in relation to incremental local government revenues that would result from construction of the project. Incremental expenditures include, but are not limited to, school operating costs, road maintenance and repair, public safety, and public utility costs.

        (f) Specific Report 3—Alternatives. This report must describe alternatives to the project and compare the environmental impacts of such alternatives to those of the proposal. The discussion must demonstrate how environmental benefits and costs were weighed against economic benefits and costs, and technological and procedural constraints. The potential for each alternative to meet project deadlines and the environmental consequences of each alternative shall be discussed. The report must discuss the “no action” alternative and the potential for accomplishing the proposed objectives through the use of other means. The report must provide an analysis of the relative environmental benefits and costs for each alternative.

        (2) The Secretary and the Comptroller General, or their duly authorized representatives, shall have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Borrower or DOE, as applicable. Such inspection may be made during regular office hours of the Borrower or DOE, as applicable, or at any other time mutually convenient.

        (b) The Secretary may from time to time audit any or all statements or certificates submitted to the Secretary. The Borrower will make available to the Secretary all books and records and other data available to the Borrower in order to permit the Secretary to carry out such audits. The Borrower should represent that it has within its rights access to all financial and operational records and data relating to the project financed by the loan, and agrees that it will, upon request by the Secretary, exercise such rights in order to make such financial and operational records and data available to the Secretary. In exercising its rights hereunder, the Secretary may utilize employees of other Federal agencies, independent accountants, or other persons.

        (c) Loan funds are being expended efficiently and effectively if documentation submitted and audits conducted under this section demonstrate that the borrower is making appropriate progress toward achieving the purpose for which the loan was originally made.

        § 611.110   Assignment or transfer of loans.

#### § § 611.110

        (a) The Loan Documents may not be modified, in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of DOE.

        (b) Upon prior written approval by DOE and the Federal Financing Bank, a certification by the assignor that the assignee is an Eligible Applicant as described in § 611.100 of this part, and subject to paragraph (c) of this section and other provisions of this part, a Borrower may assign or transfer its interest in a loan provided under this part, including the loan documents, to a party that qualifies as an Eligible Applicant.

#### § § 611.111

        (a) In the event that the Borrower has defaulted in the making of required payments of principal or interest, and such default has not been cured within the period of grace provided in the Agreement, DOE may cause the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest thereon, and all amounts owed to the United States by Borrower pursuant to the Agreement, to become immediately due and payable by giving the Borrower written notice to such effect.

        (b) In the event that the Borrower is in default as a result of a breach of one or more of the terms and conditions of the Agreement, note, mortgage, or other contractual obligations related to the transaction, other than the Borrower's obligation to pay principal or interest on the loan, and DOE determines, in writing, that such a default has materially affected the rights of the parties, the Borrower shall be given the period of grace provided in the Agreement to cure such default. If the default is not cured during the period of grace, DOE may cause the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest thereon, and all amounts owed to the United States by Borrower pursuant to the Agreement, to become immediately due and payable by giving the Borrower written notice to such effect.

        (c) In the event that the Borrower has defaulted as described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and such default is not cured during the grace period provided in the Agreement, DOE shall notify the U.S. Attorney General. DOE, acting through the U.S. Attorney General, may seek to foreclose on the collateral assets and/or take such other legal action as necessary for the protection of the Government.

        (d) If DOE is awarded title to collateral assets pursuant to a foreclosure proceeding, DOE may take action to complete, maintain, operate, or lease the Eligible Facilities, or otherwise dispose of any property acquired pursuant to the Agreement or take any other necessary action which DOE deems appropriate.

        (e) In addition to foreclosure and sale of collateral pursuant thereto, the U.S. Attorney General shall take appropriate action in accordance with rights contained in the Agreement to recover costs incurred by the Government as a result of the defaulted loan or other defaulted obligation. Any recovery so received by the U.S. Attorney General on behalf of the Government shall be applied in the following manner: First to the expenses incurred by the U.S. Attorney General and DOE in effecting such recovery; second, to reimbursement of any amounts paid by DOE as a result of the defaulted obligation; third, to any amounts owed to DOE under related principal and interest assistance contracts; and fourth, to any other lawful claims held by the Government on such process. Any sums remaining after full payment of the foregoing shall be available for the benefit of other parties lawfully entitled to claim them.

        (f) In the event that DOE considers it necessary or desirable to protect or further the interest of the United States in connection with the liquidation of collateral or recovery of deficiencies due under the loan, DOE will take such action as may be appropriate under the circumstances.

      § 626.6   Acquiring petroleum products by purchase.

#### § § 626.6

      (a)  For the purchase of petroleum products, DOE shall, through certified contracting officers, conduct petroleum product acquisitions in accordance with the competitive principles of the FAR and the DEAR.

      (b)  (1) DOE solicitations:

      (i) May be either continuously open or fixed for a period of time; and

      (ii) May provide either for immediate delivery or for delivery at future dates.

      (2) DOE may alter the acquisition plan to take advantage of differentials in prices for different qualities of petroleum products, based on a consideration of factors, including the availability of storage capacity in the SPR sites, the logistics of changing delivery streams, and the availability of ships, pipelines, and terminals to move and receive the petroleum products.

      (3) Based on the market analysis described in paragraph (d) of this section, DOE may refuse offers or suspend the acquisition process on the basis of Government estimates projecting substantially lower petroleum product prices in the future than those contained in offers. If DOE determines there is a high probability that the cost to the Government can be reduced without significantly affecting national energy security goals, DOE may either contract for delivery at a future date or delay purchases to take advantage of the projected lower future prices. Conversely, DOE may increase the rate of purchases if prices fall below recent price trends or futures markets present a significant contango and prices offer the opportunity to reduce the average cost of petroleum product acquisitions in anticipation of higher future prices.

      (4) Based on the market analysis described in paragraph (d) of this section, DOE may refuse offers, decrease the rate of purchase, or suspend the acquisition process if DOE determines acquisition will add significant upward pressure to prices either regionally or on a world-wide basis. DOE may consider recent price changes, private inventory levels, petroleum product acquisition by other stockpiling entities, the outlook for world petroleum products production, incipient disruptions of supply or refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum products, macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may be pertinent to the balance of petroleum product supply and demand.

      (c)  DOE shall develop SPR fill requirements for each solicitation based on an assessment of national energy security goals, the availability of storage capacity, and the need for specific grades and quantities of petroleum products.

      (d)  (1) DOE shall establish a market value for each petroleum product to be acquired based on a market analysis at the time of contract award.

      (2) DOE may consider prices on futures markets, spot markets, recent price movements, current and projected shipping rates, forecasts by the DOE Energy Information Administration, and any other analytic tools available to DOE to determine the most desirable purchase profile.

      (3) DOE may also consider factors including recent price changes, private inventory levels, petroleum product acquisition by other stockpiling entities, the outlook for world petroleum product production, disruptions of supply or refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum products, macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may be pertinent relevant to the balance of petroleum product supply and demand.

      (e)  (1) DOE shall evaluate offers using:

      (i) The criteria and requirements stated in the solicitation; and

      (ii) The market analysis under paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2) DOE shall require financial guarantees from the contracting entity, in the form of a letter of credit or equivalent financial assurance.

      § 626.7   Acquiring petroleum products by exchange.

#### § § 626.7

      (a)  DOE may, through certified contracting officers, conduct petroleum product acquisitions through the exchange of petroleum products. Exchanges are conducted through emergency requests or by solicitation.

      (b)  (1) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 626.5, the requirements of this subsection shall control all exchanges by emergency request.

      (3) All requests shall include the following:

      (i) A justification of need that describes:

      (A) The emergency event,

      (B) The emergency event's impact on the requestor, and

      (C) The requestor's inability to acquire petroleum product from an alternative source;

      (ii) The quantity of petroleum product (in barrels) requested;

      (iii) The quality specifications of petroleum product requested; and

      (iv) The anticipated duration of the emergency event.

      (4) Upon receipt of an emergency request, DOE will verify the emergency, evaluate the need, and assess the market to ensure there is no alternative source of petroleum products available to the requester. DOE, in its sole discretion, may approve or disapprove any emergency request.

      (5) Upon approval of an emergency request, DOE may enter into contract negotiations with the requestor.

      (6) Repayment to the SPR for an exchange by emergency request shall be in the form of barrels of petroleum products, or another form of repayment as permitted by law, and shall include the following to be returned to the SPR by the contracted date:

      (i) The principal amount of petroleum products provided to the requestor;

      (ii) A premium; and

      (iii) Costs incurred by DOE in conducting the emergency request.

      (c)  (1) A solicitation for exchange:

      (i) May be either continuously open or fixed for a period of time;

      (ii) Shall advertise the quantity and quality specification of petroleum product available for exchange;

      (iii) May provide either for immediate delivery or for delivery at future dates to a bidding entity;

      (iv) May, in DOE's sole discretion, include a rate table from which offerors may offer dates for repayment; and

      (v) May require financial guarantees from offerors in the form of a letter of credit or equivalent financial assurance to accompany their bids.

      (2) In conducting the bidding and selection process:

      (i) Offerors shall follow the instructions to offerors included in the solicitation;

      (ii) DOE shall evaluate and select bids that best support national energy security goals, the availability of petroleum products and storage capacity, and need for specific grades and quantities of petroleum products; and

      (iii) Upon selection of a successful bid, DOE shall notify the apparently successful offeror.

      (3) Repayment to the SPR for an exchange by solicitation shall be in the form of barrels of petroleum products or another form of repayment as permitted by law, and may be calculated based on any rate table, if applicable, and shall include the following:

      (i) Principal amount of petroleum product owed to SPR in the case of an exchange or a deferred contractually scheduled delivery;

      (ii) Costs incurred by DOE in conducting the exchange; and

      (iii) A premium for each prospective date for repayment.

      (4) Based on the market analysis described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, DOE may refuse offers, decrease the rate of acquisition, or suspend the exchange process if DOE determines acquisition will add significant upward pressure to prices either regionally or on a worldwide basis. DOE may consider recent price changes, private inventory levels, petroleum product acquisition by other stockpiling entities, the outlook for world petroleum products production, incipient disruptions of supply or refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum products, macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may be pertinent to the balance of petroleum product supply and demand.

      (5) Market analysis:

      (i) DOE shall establish a market value for each petroleum product to be acquired based on a market analysis at the time of contract award.

      (ii) DOE may consider prices on futures markets, spot markets, recent price movements, current and projected shipping rates, forecasts by the DOE Energy Information Administration, and any other analytic tools available to DOE to determine the most desirable purchase profile.

      (iii) DOE may also consider factors including recent price changes, private inventory levels, petroleum product acquisition by other stockpiling entities, the outlook for world petroleum product production, disruptions of supply or refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum products, macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may be pertinent relevant to the balance of petroleum product supply and demand.

      § 626.8   Deferrals of contractually scheduled deliveries.

#### § § 626.8

      (a)  (1) DOE prefers to take deliveries of petroleum products for the SPR at times scheduled under applicable contracts. However, in the event the market is distorted by disruption to supply or other factors, DOE may defer scheduled deliveries or consider deferral requests from awardees.

      (2) An awardee seeking to defer scheduled deliveries of petroleum products to the SPR may submit a deferral request to DOE.

      (b)  DOE shall only grant a deferral request for negotiation under paragraph (c) of this section if it determines that DOE can receive a premium for the deferral and, based on DOE's deferral analysis, that at least one of the following conditions exists:

      (1) DOE can reduce the cost of its petroleum products acquisition per barrel and increase the volume of petroleum products being delivered to the SPR by means of the premium barrels required by the deferral process;

      (2) DOE anticipates private inventories are approaching a point where unscheduled outages may occur;

      (3) There is evidence that refineries are reducing their run rates for lack of feedstock; or

      (4) There is an unanticipated disruption to petroleum product supply.

      (c)  (1) If DOE decides to negotiate a deferral of deliveries, DOE shall estimate the market value of the deferral and establish a strategy for negotiating with suppliers the minimum percentage of the market value to be taken by the Government. During these negotiations, if the deferral request was initiated by DOE, DOE may consider any reasonable, customary, and applicable costs already incurred by the supplier in the performance of a valid contract for delivery. In no event shall such consideration account for any consequential damages or lost profits suffered by the supplier as a result of such deferral.

      (2) DOE shall only agree to amend the contract if the negotiation results in an agreement to give the Government a fair and reasonable share of the market value.

      § 626.9   Suspension and pre-drawdown diversion.

#### § § 626.9

      Where the Secretary has found that a severe energy supply interruption may be imminent, the Secretary may suspend any previously announced or contracted acquisition of any petroleum product by the SPR or injection of petroleum products into the SPR; or sell any petroleum product acquired for injection into the SPR that has not yet been injected into the SPR.
