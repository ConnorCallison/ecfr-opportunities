                  "(6) Takeout of interim financing: Guaranteeing a loan that provides for permanent, long-term financing after project completion to pay off a lender's interim loan will not be treated as debt refinancing provided that the lender submits a complete request for preliminary eligibility review or complete application that proposes such interim financing prior to closing the interim loan. The borrower must take no action until the conclusion of the environmental review process prior to any action that would have an adverse effect on the environment or limit the choices of any reasonable alternatives to be considered by the Agency. Interim financing is typically used to pay costs associated with a planned project, such as construction or installation of equipment, however, the Agency will consider, on a case-by-case basis, other reasons to use interim financing. The term for interim financing loans should be for the construction period plus a reasonable time for the business to begin generation of working capital to amortize the loan. Guaranteed promissory notes that do not convert the interim financing payment schedule to an amortizing permanent schedule in the same note are not allowed. In certain cases, the applicant lender may use interim financing to pay-off a borrower's maturing loan with another lender if it is in the best interests of the borrower. The takeout of interim financing is only eligible when the permanent loan on which the guarantee will be placed takes out the interim financing that financed the planned project and when the lender submits a complete preliminary eligibility review or application to the Agency that proposes the interim financing prior to closing the interim loan. If the interim financing does not meet these requirements, it is considered debt refinancing and must comply with § 5001.102(d). If the guarantee is issued prior to construction, the promissory note must contain and convert the terms of the interim financing to permanent financing. The Agency will not guarantee takeout of interim financing loans that prevent a meaningful environmental assessment prior to Agency loan approval. Even for projects with interim financing, the Agency cannot approve the loan nor issue a conditional commitment until the environmental process is complete. The Agency assumes no responsibility or obligation for interim loans.\n\n\n",

The third party (lessee) must directly utilize the equipment to fulfill the statutory purposes of REAP, to generate renewable energy or provide energy savings. The borrower must maintain ownership and control of the project for the entire useful life of the project, including site, income and expenses via the lease agreement. Additionally, all other REAP requirements, must be reviewed in this scenario to ensure complete eligibility is obtained with a lease in place. This includes, but is not limited to, project eligibility, including prohibitions on residential use and other prescribed eligible project costs. A REAP applicant may lease out a commercial building, improved with REAP funds, to various tenants. This may include an office complex in which a Federal Government Agency is a tenant. This is allowable as long as conflict of interest requirements are complied with.\n\n\n"

In all cases one hundred percent of the guaranteed loan funds are or will be invested by the investment fund entity in one or more sub-CDEs that will then be loaned directly to a QALICB, as defined by applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, through a direct tracing method, and such guaranteed loan funds are, or will be used by the QALICB in accordance with the eligibility requirements in subpart B of this part. The QALICB's project must be the ultimate use of one hundred percent of the guaranteed loan funds.\n\n\n",

                  "(2) The guaranteed loan amount and percentage of guarantee provisions found in §§ 5001.406 and 5001.407 of this part, respectively, apply to the QALICB and not to the investor fund entity or leveraged lender entity, who would actually be the borrower as defined under this part.\n",
                  "(3) For purposes of calculating borrower equity in compliance with § 5001.105(d)(1), the leveraged lender entity's note from the investor fund may be considered a tangible asset and when the lien associated with the sub-CDE's loan is subordinated, the principal balance of the sub-CDE's loan made to the QALICB from NMTC investor funds may be considered as equity.\n",
                  "(4) The loan terms found in § 5001.402 of this part apply to both the borrower and the QALICB. The maturity and related payment schedule of the lender's guaranteed loan to the borrower must be no longer than the maturity and related payment schedule of the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB. An Agency approved unequal or escalating schedule of principal and interest payments can be used for a NMTC loan. The lender may require additional principal repayment by a co-borrower, such as an owner or principal participant of the QALICB. The provisions of § 5001.402(b)(3) notwithstanding, the Agency may consider the payment of interest-only payments by a borrower pursuant to an interest-only term not to exceed seven years on a loan made under an NMTC structure if the lender requires:\n",
                  "(i) A debt repayment reserve fund or sinking fund in an amount at least equal to the guaranteed loan's principal amortization that would have otherwise applied to the loan if equally amortized payments were collected during the seven-year term; and\n",
                  "(ii) Such reserve funds or sinking funds are applied to the guaranteed loan as an additional payment of principal at the end of such interest-only term. The debt repayment reserve fund or sinking fund may be accumulated during the loan terms, or the full amount may be funded at loan closing.\n\n\n",
                  "(5) Except for the collateral provisions, § 5001.202(b)(4), § 5001.202(b) of this part applies to both the lender's guaranteed loan to the borrower and the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB. The collateral provisions found in § 5001.202(b)(4) of this part apply only to the sub-CDE's loan to the QALICB.\n",
                  "(6) The personal, partnership and corporate guarantee provisions of § 5001.204 of this part apply when the guaranteed loan borrower is a leveraged lender entity in a NMTC project. Guaranteed loans made directly to an investor fund entity as the borrower do not require a personal, partnership, or corporate guarantee from the investor fund entity's owner, who is the NMTC tax credit investor and considered a passive investor. The Agency shall obtain the personal, partnership or corporate guarantee from the QALICB ownership for a guaranteed loan to an investor fund entity in compliance with § 5001.204, subject to the eligibility requirements of the NMTC program. The Agency may require additional personal, partnership or corporate guarantees if warranted by an Agency evaluation of potential financial risk. The QALICB is the ultimate user of the guaranteed loan funds, and their owners should provide a guarantee of the guaranteed loan as stipulated in § 5001.204.\n",
                  "(7) The insurance provisions of § 5001.205(d) of this part apply only to the QALICB and the sub-CDE's secured loan to the QALICB.\n",
                  "(8) The financial report provisions of § 5001.504 of this part apply to both the borrower and the QALICB.\n\n\n",

The Agency also requires submission of the loan terms and documents between the sub-CDE and QALICB. As part of the application completed by the lender, the documentation must include comparable industry information and a summary of the NMTC project's funding path and an explanation of the relationships between all parties in the NMTC transaction (an accompanying schematic is encouraged for complicated transactions).\n",
                  "(10) The environmental responsibilities specified in § 5001.207 of this part apply to the NMTC project.\n",
                  "(11) For any application that the Agency assigns a priority score, when assigning the priority score to a NMTC loan application, the Agency will score the project based on the entire NMTC structure and the QALICB's project as the ultimate use of guaranteed loan funds.\n",
                  "(12) The lender is responsible for ensuring that the NMTC project complies with the planning, performing, development and project monitoring provisions in § 5001.205 of this part and the lender is also responsible for ensuring the NMTC project complies with all applicable Treasury NMTC requirements.\n",
                  "(13) Sections 5001.401 through 5001.408 of this part apply to both the borrower and the QALICB in a NMTC transaction.\n",
