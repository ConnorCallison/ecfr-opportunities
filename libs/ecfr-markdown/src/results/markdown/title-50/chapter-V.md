#### § § 501.7

    (a) Where possible, each request for amendment or correction shall be reviewed, and a determination on the request made, by the Privacy Officer within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays).

    (c) In reviewing a request for amendment or correction of a record, the Privacy Officer shall consider the following criteria:

    (1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;

    (2) The factual accuracy of the information sought to be amended or corrected;

    (3) The relevance and necessity of the information sought to be amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was collected;

    (4) The timeliness and currency of the information sought to be amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was collected;

    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the Commission offices;

    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject of a single request; or

#### § § 530.1

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures which supplement the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations and provide for the implementation of those provisions identified in § 1507.3(b) of the regulations which are applicable to the activities of the Commission in light of its statutory functions and responsibilities.

    § 530.2   Ensuring that environmental documents are actually considered in agency decision-making.

#### § § 530.2

    Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decision-making. To implement these requirements, Commission officials shall:

    (a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for agency actions;

    (b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses accompany the proposal through existing agency review processes;

    (c) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating any proposal for action by the Commission which is likely to significantly affect the quality of the human environment; and

    (d) Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared, consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS. All Commission officials directly involved in developing, evaluating, and/or reaching decisions on proposed actions shall consider relevant environmental documents and comply with the applicable provisions of the NEPA process.

    § 530.3   Typical classes of action.

#### § § 530.3

    Section 1507.3(b)(2), in conjunction with § 1508.4, requires agencies to identify typical classes of action that warrant similar treatment under NEPA with respect to the preparation of EIS's or environmental assessments. As a general matter, the Commission's activities do not include actions for which EIS's or environmental assessments are required. Its activities involve:

    (a) Consultation with and recommendations to other Federal agencies for actions relating to marine mammal protection and conservation for which an EIS or environmental assessment is either not required by the NEPA regulations or for which an EIS or environmental assessment is prepared by another Federal agency; and

    (b) Research contracts relating to policy issues, biological-ecological data needed to make sound management decisions, and better methods for collecting and analyzing data. These activities are not, by themselves, major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and the Commission's activities are therefore categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or environmental assessment except for proposals for legislation which are initiated by the Commission, for which the Commission shall develop environmental assessments or EIS's, as appropriate, in accordance with the NEPA regulations. The Commission shall independently determine whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:

    (1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action above; or

    (2) For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.

    § 530.4   Environmental information.

#### § § 530.4

    Interested persons may contact the Office of the General Counsel for information regarding the Commission's compliance with NEPA.

  PART 540—INFORMATION SECURITY

### Part 540

**Authority:** Authority: Executive Order 12356.

    § 540.1   Policy.

#### § § 540.1

    It is the policy of the Marine Mammal Commission to act in accordance with Executive Order 12356 in matters relating to national security information.

> [44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]

    § 540.2   Program.

#### § § 540.2

    The Executive Director is designated as the Commission's official responsible for implementation and oversight of information security programs and procedures. He acts as the recipient of questions, suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this program, and is solely responsible for changes to it and for insuring that it is at all times consistent with Executive Order 12356. The Executive Director also serves as the Commission's official contact for requests for declassification of materials submitted under the provisions of Executive Order 12356, regardless of the point of origin of such requests. He is responsible for assuring that requests submitted under the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act and that declassification requests submitted under the provisions of Executive Order 12356 are acted upon within 60 days of receipt.

> [44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]

    § 540.3   Procedures.

#### § § 540.3

    (a)  All requests for mandatory review shall be handled by the Executive Director or his designee. Under no circumstances shall the Exective Director refuse to confirm the existence or non-existence of a document requested under the Freedom of Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 12356, unless the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be classified under Executive Order 12356. Requests for declassification shall be acted upon promptly providing that the request reasonably describes the information which is the subject of the request for declassification. In light of the fact that the Commission does not have original classification authority and national security information in its custody has been classified by another Federal agency, the Executive Director will refer all requests for national security information in its custody to the Federal agency that classified it or, if the agency that classified it has either ceased to exist or transferred the information in conjunction with a transfer of functions, to the appropriate federal agency exercising original classification authority with respect to the same subject, for review and disposition in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and that agency's regulations and guidelines.

    (b)  When an employee or contractor of the Commission originates information that is believed to require classification, the Executive Director shall ensure that it is protected in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and shall promptly transmit it under appropriate safeguards to the agency with appropriate subject matter jurisdiction and classification authority for review and action in accordance with the Order and that agency's regulations and guidelines.

    (c)  Derivative classification markings shall be applied to information that is in substance the same as information that is already classified, in accordance with Executive Order 12356, Section 2-1, unless it is determined through inquiries made to the originators of the classified information or other appropriate persons that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of the classified information obviates the need for its classification, in which case the information shall be issued as unclassified or shall be marked appropriately. After verifying the current level of classification so far as practicable, paper copies of such derivatively classified information shall be marked so as to indicate:

    (1) The source of the original classification;

    (2) The identity of the Commission employee originating the derivatively classified document;

    (3) The dates or events for declassification or review for declassification indicated on the classified source material; and

    (4) Any additional authorized markings appearing on the source material.

    (d)  All classified documents shall be delivered to the Executive Director or his designee immediately upon receipt. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of such designees and updated information as necessary. In the event that the Executive Director or his designee is not available to receive such documents, they shall be turned over to the Administrative Officer and secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in the Commission offices until the Executive Director or his designee is available. Under no circumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered to the Executive Director or his designee be stored other than in the designated safe.

    (e)  Reproduction of classified material shall take place only in accordance with Executive Order 12356, its implementing directives, and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained, where required by the Executive Order, by the Administrative Officer and the log stored with the original documents. These measures shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review.

    (f)  All classified documents shall be stored in the combination safe located in the Commission's offices. The combination shall be changed as required by ISOO Directive No. 1, dated June 23, 1982. The combination shall be known only to the Executive Director and his designees with the appropriate security clearance.

    (g)  All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and shall be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate ISOO directives. This shall be effected by a memorandum to all affected employees at the time these procedures are implemented. New employees will be instructed in procedures as they enter employment with the Commission.

    (h)  The use of the terms   and  shall be limited to materials classified for national security purposes.

#### § § 550.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 550.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
