      § 1110.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1110.1

      The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the “Act”), 42 U.S.C. 2000d , to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, or the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

      § 1110.2   Application of part.

#### § § 1110.2

      This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities, or the Institute of Museum and Library Services, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the part, including assistance pursuant to an application approved prior to such date. It also applies to federal financial assistance extended to any such program prior to the effective date of this part under a contract or grant where the term of the contract or grant continues beyond such date or where the assistance was to provide real or personal property and the recipient or his transferee continues to use or retain ownership or possession of the property (see § 1110.4(a)(1)). This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (b) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (c) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 1110.3. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the

      § 1110.3   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1110.3

      (a)  No person in the United States shall, on grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected, to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.

      (b)  (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:

      (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

      (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;

      (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

      (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

      (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

      (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).

      (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

      (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.

      (4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.

      (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.

      (c)  (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to assist such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training or (ii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals or (iii) to reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs.

      (2) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Executive Order 11246 or any executive order which supersedes it.

      (3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of the foregoing subparagraph of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.

      (d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 1110.4   Assurances required.

#### § § 1110.4

      (a)  (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer; and any other type or form of assistance, the assurances shall be in effect for the duration of the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. The responsible Endowment official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.

      (2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipients shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Endowment to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Endowment official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Chairman of the Endowment concerned may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

      (3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. (41 CFR 101-6.2)

      (b)  Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Endowment official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.

      (c)  The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part within the earliest practicable time and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any case of continuing Federal financial assistance, the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.

      (d)  (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for a special training project, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.

      (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.

      § 1110.5   Illustrative applications.

#### § § 1110.5

      The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities for which Federal financial assistance is provided by the Endowments. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.)

      (a) In a research, training, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.

      (b) In cases of Federal financial assistance to elementary or secondary schools, discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the recipient private institution, in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.

      (c) In a training grant to a nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution, discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity, any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.

      (d) Where Federal financial assistance is provided to assist in the presentation of artistic and cultural productions to the public, assurances will be required that such productions will not be presented before any audience which has been selected on a discriminatory basis.

      (e) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus, a State, in selecting projects to be supported through a State agency, may not base its selections on criteria which have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the Federal financial assistance as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

      (f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 1110.6(d) to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.

      (g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.

      § 1110.6   Compliance information.

#### § § 1110.6

      (a)  The responsible Endowment official shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

      (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the responsible Endowment official timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible Endowment official may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

      (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible Endowment official or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

      (d)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Endowment official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

      § 1110.7   Conduct of investigations.

#### § § 1110.7

      (a)  The responsible Endowment official shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.

      (b)  Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the responsible Endowment official a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than ninety days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible Endowment official.

      (c)  The responsible Endowment official will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.

      (d)  (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the responsible Endowment official will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 1110.8.

      (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible Endowment official will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

      (e)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

      § 1110.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 1110.8

      (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

      (b)  If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 1110.4 or otherwise fails to comply with that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Endowment concerned shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that such Endowment shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.

      (c)  No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Endowment official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearings, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Chairman of the Endowment concerned, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Chairman has filed with the Committee of the House and the Committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

      (d)  No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Endowment official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

      § 1110.9   Hearings.

#### § § 1110.9

      (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1110.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:

      (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Endowment official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or

      (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right of a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1110.8(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

      (b)  Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Endowment concerned in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible Endowment official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Endowment requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Endowment official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.

      (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Endowment shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

      (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Endowment and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

      (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence entered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

      (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this Regulation with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Chairman of the Endowment concerned may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings and for the application to such hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1110.10.

      § 1110.10   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 1110.10

      (a)  If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Endowment official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Endowment official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Endowment official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible Endowment official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Endowment official.

      (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Endowment official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible Endowment official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Endowment official shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant if any.

      (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1110.9(a) a decision shall be made by the responsible Endowment official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

      (d)  Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible Endowment official shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

      (e)  Any final decision of a responsible Endowment official (other than the Chairman) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Chairman, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.

      (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Endowment official that it will fully comply with this part.

      (g)  (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation. (An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 1110.3 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance, if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation which meets the requirements of § 1110.4(c), and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with this court order or plan.)

      (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Endowment official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Endowment official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.

      (3) If the responsible Endowment official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Endowment official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

    PART 1148—PROCEDURES FOR DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA)

### Part 1148

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552; 28 U.S.C. 1746; 31 U.S.C. 3717; E.O. 12600, 52 FR 23781, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp.

**Source:** Source: 84 FR 6345, Feb. 27, 2019, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1148.1   What is the purpose and scope of these regulations?

#### § § 1148.1

      This part contains the rules that the Arts Endowment follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with the Arts Endowment's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this part.

      § 1148.2   How will the Arts Endowment make proactive disclosures?

#### § § 1148.2

      Records that the Arts Endowment makes available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Arts Endowment's open government page, available at  The Arts Endowment will determine which of its records should be made publicly available, identify additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and post and index such records. The Arts Endowment will ensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

      § 1148.3   How can I make a FOIA request?

#### § § 1148.3

      (a)  To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Arts Endowment at National Endowment for the Arts, Office of General Counsel, 400 7th St. SW, Second Floor, Washington, DC 20506. Requests may also be sent by facsimile to the General Counsel's office at (202) 682-5572, or by email to

      (b)  Depending on the type of document you ask for, the Arts Endowment may require verification of your identity or the identity of a third party.

      (1) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the Arts Endowment's verification requirements as set forth in § 1159.9 of this chapter.

      (2) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased ( a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Arts Endowment may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

      (c)  Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Arts Endowment personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help the Arts Endowment identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. Contact information for the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact and FOIA Public Liaison is available on the Arts Endowment's FOIA website (), or can be obtained by calling (202) 682-54184. If after receiving a request, the Arts Endowment determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Arts Endowment's response to the request may be delayed.

      (d)  Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. The Arts Endowment will accommodate your request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.

      (e)  Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the Arts Endowment in communicating with them and providing released records.

      § 1148.4   How will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?

#### § § 1148.4

      (a)  In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Arts Endowment ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.

      (b)  The Arts Endowment Chairperson or his/her designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by the Arts Endowment.

      (c)  When reviewing records located by the Arts Endowment in response to a request, the Arts Endowment will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Arts Endowment will proceed in one of the following ways:

      (1)  When records originated with the Arts Endowment, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the Arts Endowment will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.

      (2)  (i) When the Arts Endowment believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Arts Endowment typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Arts Endowment and the originating agency jointly agree that the Arts Endowment is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

      (ii) Whenever the Arts Endowment refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

      (d)  The Arts Endowment will consider a FOIA request to be a perfected FOIA request if it complies with this section. All consultations and referrals received by the Arts Endowment will be handled in the order of the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.

      (e)  The Arts Endowment may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

      § 1148.5   When will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?

#### § § 1148.5

      (a)  The Arts Endowment ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt.

      (b)  The Arts Endowment will designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The Arts Endowment may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Arts Endowment may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

      (c)  Whenever the Arts Endowment cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Arts Endowment extends the time limit on that basis, the Arts Endowment will, before expiration of the 20 business day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Arts Endowment estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Arts Endowment will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Arts Endowment will make available its designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Arts Endowment will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.

      (d)  To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Arts Endowment may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Arts Endowment will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

      (e)  Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(i), the Arts Endowment may grant expedited processing under certain circumstances:

      (1) The Arts Endowment will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

      (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.

      (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be submitted to the Arts Endowment's Office of General Counsel. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the Arts Endowment's FOIA Appeals Office per § 1148.8(a).

      (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Arts Endowment may waive the formal certification requirement.

      (4) The Arts Endowment will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Arts Endowment will act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.

      § 1148.6   How will I receive responses to my requests?

#### § § 1148.6

      (a)  The Arts Endowment, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the internet electronically, such as email or web portal.

      (b)  The Arts Endowment will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Arts Endowment will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

      (c)  Upon request, the Arts Endowment will provide an estimated date by which the Arts Endowment expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the Arts Endowment may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.

      (d)  Once the Arts Endowment determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The Arts Endowment will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1148.10 and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Arts Endowment will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

      (e)  If the Arts Endowment makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.

      (f)  The denial will be signed by the Arts Endowment's General Counsel or designee and will include:

      (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;

      (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the Arts Endowment in denying the request;

      (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

      (4) A statement that:

      (i) The denial may be appealed under § 1148.8(a);

      (ii) That the requester has 90 days to file an appeal in order for it to be considered timely, and that the Arts Endowment will not process or consider appeals that were not filed within 90 days of the receipt of an adverse determination; and

      (iii) A description of the appeal requirements; and

      (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Arts Endowment's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.

      (g)  In the event that the Arts Endowment identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Arts Endowment will confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion. The Arts Endowment, when invoking an exclusion will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.

      § 1148.7   How does the Arts Endowment handle confidential commercial information?

#### § § 1148.7

      (a)  The following definitions apply to this section.

      (1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by the Arts Endowment from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

      (2)  means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

      (b)  A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

      (c)  The following rules and procedures determine when the Arts Endowment will provide written notice to submitters of confidential commercial information that their information may be disclosed under FOIA.

      (1) The Arts Endowment will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if the Arts Endowment determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

      (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (ii) The Arts Endowment has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

      (2) The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the Arts Endowment may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.

      (d)  The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

      (1) The Arts Endowment determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

      (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

      (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, the Arts Endowment will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

      (e)  A submitter will have the opportunity to object to disclosure of information under FOIA.

      (1) The Arts Endowment will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it must provide the Arts Endowment a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.

      (3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The Arts Endowment is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this part may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (f)  The Arts Endowment must consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

      (g)  Whenever the Arts Endowment decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Arts Endowment will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

      (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the Arts Endowment intends to release them; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time after the notice.

      (h)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Arts Endowment will promptly notify the submitter.

      (i)  The Arts Endowment will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

      § 1148.8   How can I appeal a denial of my request?

#### § § 1148.8

      (a)  A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the Arts Endowment's office designated to receive FOIA appeals (“FOIA Appeals Office”). Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 1148.6(e). Requesters can submit appeals by mail by writing to Arts Endowment Chairman, c/o Office of General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts, 400 7th Street SW, Washington, DC 20506, or online in accordance with instructions on the Arts Endowment's website (). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the adverse determination. The appeal should clearly identify the Arts Endowment's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

      (b)  (1) The Arts Endowment's Chairperson or his/her designee will act on behalf of the Arts Endowment's Chief FOIA Officer on all appeals under this section.

      (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

      (c)  The Arts Endowment will provide its decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Arts Endowment's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for its decision, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Arts Endowment's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the Arts Endowment will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The Arts Endowment will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.

      (d)  Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Arts Endowment agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

      (e)  Before seeking review by a court of the Arts Endowment's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

      (f)  After receiving the Arts Endowment's adverse determination, a requester has 90 calendar days to file an appeal in order for it to be considered timely. The Arts Endowment will not process or consider appeals that were not filed within 90 calendar days of the date of an adverse determination.

      § 1148.9   What are the Arts Endowment policies regarding preservation of records?

#### § § 1148.9

      The Arts Endowment will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this part, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Arts Endowment will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.

      § 1148.10   How will fees be charged?

#### § § 1148.10

      (a)  (1) The Arts Endowment will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

      (i) Commercial use requesters;

      (ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

      (iii) All other requesters.

      (2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The Arts Endowment will consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the Arts Endowment may contact a requester for additional information. The Arts Endowment will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Arts Endowment ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by the Arts Endowment.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Arts Endowment's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Arts Endowment will notify requesters of their placement in this category.

      (2)  are those expenses that the Arts Endowment incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work ( the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. _Direct costs_ do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

      (3)  is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

      (4)  is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. The Arts Endowment may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and the Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (i)  A request from a professor of architecture at a university for records relating to Arts Endowment grants related to architecture, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.

      (ii)  A request from the same professor of architecture seeking translation grant information from the Arts Endowment in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.

      (iii)  A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.

      (5)  is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (6)  is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Arts Endowment may also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (7)  is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. _Review_ time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1148.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (8)  is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. _Search_ time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

      (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, the Arts Endowment will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Arts Endowment will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

      (1)  The following fee policies apply to searches:

      (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. The Arts Endowment will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Arts Endowment may properly charge for time spent searching even if the Arts Endowment does not locate any responsive records or if the Arts Endowment determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

      (ii) For manual searches, the fee charged will be the salary rate or rates of the employee or employees conducting the search. For computer searches, the fee charged will be the actual direct cost of providing the service, including the salary rate or rates of the operator(s) or programmer(s) conducting the search. The salary rate is calculated as the particular employee's basic pay plus 16.1 percent. The Arts Endowment may charge fees even if the documents are determined to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located.

      (iii) The Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. The Arts Endowment will notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

      (iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by the Arts Endowment at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Arts Endowment will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

      (2)  The Arts Endowment will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Arts Endowment will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the Arts Endowment can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the Arts Endowment will provide one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per single sided page, and $.20 per double sided page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs.

      (3)  The Arts Endowment will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by the Arts Endowment to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Arts Endowment's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (d)  The Arts Endowment will adhere to the following restrictions regarding fees it charges:

      (1) When the Arts Endowment determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.

      (2) If the Arts Endowment fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it will not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section.

      (3) If the Arts Endowment has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the Arts Endowment provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 working days.

      (4) If the Arts Endowment has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Arts Endowment may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken:

      (i) The Arts Endowment provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and

      (ii) The Arts Endowment discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Arts Endowment may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

      (5) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (6) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

      (7) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Arts Endowment will provide without charge:

      (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

      (ii) The first two hours of search.

      (8) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.

      (e)  The following procedures apply when the Arts Endowment anticipates fees to be in excess of $25.00.

      (1) When the Arts Endowment determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Arts Endowment will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Arts Endowment will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

      (2) If the Arts Endowment notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Arts Endowment is not required to accept payments in installments.

      (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Arts Endowment estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Arts Endowment will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Arts Endowment will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

      (4) The Arts Endowment will make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other designated FOIA contact to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

      (f)  Although not required to provide special services, if the Arts Endowment chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

      (g)  The Arts Endowment may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Arts Endowment. The Arts Endowment will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (h)  When the Arts Endowment reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Arts Endowment may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Arts Endowment may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Arts Endowment will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

      (i)  The following policies and procedures apply to advanced payments of fees:

      (1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the Arts Endowment will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (2) When the Arts Endowment determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Arts Endowment may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

      (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Arts Endowment may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Arts Endowment may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Arts Endowment begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Arts Endowment has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

      (4) In cases in which the Arts Endowment requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Arts Endowment's fee determination, the request will be closed.

      (j)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Arts Endowment to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

      (k)  The following policies and procedures apply to fee waivers or reductions of fees.

      (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) The Arts Endowment will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

      (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

      (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Arts Endowment will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

      (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Arts Endowment will consider the following criteria:

      (A) The Arts Endowment will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

      (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Arts Endowment will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Arts Endowment ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the factors in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

      (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.

      (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Arts Endowment and should address the criteria referenced in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

        (iii) Such documents, suitably identified, have been withheld based upon the assertion of an identified privilege.

        (b) Nothing in this section precludes or limits an investigating official's discretion to refer allegations within the Department of Justice for suit under the False Claims Act or other civil relief, or to defer or postpone a report or referral to the reviewing official to avoid interference with a criminal investigation or prosecution.

#### § § 1149.12

        (a) If the investigating official concludes that an action under this part is warranted, the investigating official submits a report containing the findings and conclusions of the investigation to the reviewing official.

        (b) If the reviewing official determines that the report provides adequate evidence that you have made a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim or statement, the reviewing official shall transmit to the Attorney General written notice of an intention to refer the matter for adjudication, with a request for approval of such referral. This notice will include the reviewing official's statements concerning:

        (1) The reasons for the referral;

        (2) The claims or statements upon which liability would be based;

        (b) Except as provided in this part, the ALJ is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may choose to apply the Federal Rules of Evidence where he/she deems appropriate, for example, to exclude unreliable evidence.

        (c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.

        (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

        (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law.

        (f) The following evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement is inadmissible when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction:

        (2) Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts must be exchanged.

        (c) The ALJ must exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:

        (3) Protect witnesses from harassment and undue embarrassment.

#### § § 1149.53

        Ex parte communications between a party and the ALJ are not permitted unless the other party consents to such a communication taking place. This does not prohibit a party from inquiring about the status of a case or asking routine questions concerning administrative functions or procedures.

#### § § 1149.74

        These procedures separate the functions of the investigating official, reviewing official, and the ALJ, each of whom report to a separate organizational authority. Except for purposes of settlement, or as a witness or a representative in public proceedings, no investigating official, reviewing official, or NEA employee or agent who helps investigate, prepare, or present a case may (in such case, or a factually related case) participate in the initial decision or the review of the initial decision by the authority head. This separation of functions and organization is designed to assure the independence and impartiality of each government official during every stage of the proceeding. The representative for the NEA may be employed in the offices of either the investigating official or the reviewing official.

        (q)  means a payroll procedure to collect a debt under 5 U.S.C. 5514 by deduction(s) at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of an employee, without his or her consent.

        § 1150.2   What is the Endowment's authority to issue these regulations?

#### § § 1150.2

        The Endowment is issuing the regulations in this part under 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716-3718, and 3720A. These sections reflect the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. The Endowment is also issuing the regulations in this part in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, which prescribe standards for the handling of the Federal government's claims for money or property. The Endowment is further issuing the regulations in this part in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and the salary offset regulations published by the OPM at 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

        § 1150.3   What other regulations also apply to the Endowment's debt collection efforts?

#### § § 1150.3

        All provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards also apply to the regulations in this part. This part supplements the Federal Claims Collection Standards by prescribing procedures and directives necessary and appropriate for operations of the Endowment.

        § 1150.4   What types of claims are excluded from these regulations?

#### § § 1150.4

        (a) The regulations in this part do not apply to any claim as to which there is an indication of fraud or misrepresentation, as described in the Federal Claims Collection Standards, unless returned to the Endowment by the DOJ for handling.

        (b) The regulations in this subpart, subpart B, and subpart D do not apply to debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ); and the tariff laws of the United States.

        (c) Remedies and procedures described in this part may be authorized with respect to claims that are exempt from the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.

        § 1150.5   What notice will I be provided if I owe a debt to the Endowment?

#### § § 1150.5

        (a) When the Chairperson determines that you owe a debt to the Endowment, he or she will send you a written notice (Notice). The Notice will be hand-delivered or sent to you by certified mail, return receipt requested at the most current address known to the Endowment. The Notice will inform you of the following:

        (1) The amount, nature, and basis of the debt;

        (2) That a designated Endowment official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid;

        (3) That payment of the debt is due as of the date of the Notice, and that the debt will be considered delinquent if you do not pay it within 30 days of the date of the Notice;

        (4) The Endowment's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs (see § 1150.7), including a statement that such assessments must be made against you unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards and this part;

        (5) That you have the right to inspect and copy Endowment records pertaining to your debt, or to receive copies of those records if personal inspection is impractical;

        (6) That you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement, in writing and signed by both you and the Chairperson, for voluntary repayment of the debt (see § 1150.9); and

        (7) The address, telephone number, and name of the Endowment official available to discuss the debt.

        (b) Notice of possible collection actions. The Notice provided by the Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section will also advise you that, if your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is not paid within 60 days of the date of the Notice, or you do not enter into a voluntary repayment agreement within 60 days of the date of the Notice, then the Endowment may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods:

        (1) By referral to a credit reporting agency (see § 1150.12), a collection agency (see § 1150.13), or the DOJ (see § 1150.14);

        (2) By transferring any debt delinquent for more than 180 days to the Treasury for collection under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury (see § 1150.15);

        (3) If you are an Endowment employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account (in the amount and with the frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration specified by the Endowment) until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full (see subpart B). Such proceedings are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514;

        (4) If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than the Endowment, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency (see subpart B). Such proceedings are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514;

        (5) By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax (see subpart C);

        (6) By administrative offset (see subpart D); or

        (7) By liquidation of security or collateral. When the Endowment holds security or collateral that may be liquidated and the proceeds applied to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, such procedures may be followed unless the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure.

        (c) Notice of opportunity for review. The Notice provided by the Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section will also advise you of the opportunity to obtain a review within the Endowment concerning the existence or amount of the debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. The Notice shall also advise you of the following:

        (1) The name, address, and telephone number of an officer or employee of the Endowment whom you may contact concerning procedures for requesting a review;

        (2) The method and time period for requesting a review;

        (3) That the filing of a request for a review on or before the 60th day following the date of the Notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

        (4) The name and address of the officer or employee of the Endowment to whom you should send the request for a review;

        (5) That a final decision on the review (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings;

        (6) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject you to:

        (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statute or regulations;

        (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) or any other applicable statutory authority; and

        (iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or any other applicable statutory authority;

        (7) Any other rights available to you to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived, or remedies available to you under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

        (8) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt that are later waived or found not owed will be promptly refunded to you.

        (d) The Endowment will respond promptly to communications from you.

        § 1150.6   What opportunity do I have to obtain a review of my debt within the Endowment?

#### § § 1150.6

        (a)  If you desire a review within the Endowment concerning the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable, you must send such a request to the officer or employee of the Endowment designated in the Notice (see § 1150.5(c)(4)).

        (1) Your request for review must carry your signature and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts and evidence that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.

        (2) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of the Endowment on or before the 60th day following the date of the Notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. If you file a request for a review after the 60-day period provided for in this section, the Endowment will accept the request if you can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control or because you did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline).

        (b)  (1) In accordance with § 1150.5, if you want to inspect or copy Endowment records related to the debt, you must send a letter to the Endowment official designated in the Notice stating your intention. Your letter must be received within 30 days of the date of the Notice.

        (2) In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated Endowment official will notify you of the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to the debt.

        (3) If personal inspection of Endowment records related to the debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you copies of those records.

        (c)  The Chairperson shall designate an officer or employee of the Endowment (who was not involved in the determination of the debt) as the review official. When required by law or regulation, the Endowment may request an administrative law judge to conduct the review, or may obtain a review official who is an official, employee, or agent of the United States, but who is not under the supervision or control of the Chairperson. However, unless the review is conducted by an official or employee of the Endowment, any unresolved dispute you have regarding whether all or part of the debt is past due or legally enforceable (for purposes of collection by tax refund offset under § 1150.31) must be referred to the Chairperson for ultimate administrative disposition, and the Chairperson must notify you of his or her determination.

        (d)  After you request a review, the review official will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review official shall determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. In either case, the review official shall conduct the review in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. If the review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing.

        (e)  The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing, as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the Endowment received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.

        (f)  The review official will prepare a written decision that includes:

        (1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

        (2) The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and

        (3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.

        (g)  Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.

        § 1150.7   What interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will I have to pay on a debt owed to the Endowment?

#### § § 1150.7

        (a)  (1) The Endowment will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.

        (2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Endowment will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Endowment shall assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of the Endowment or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. The Endowment will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of the Endowment.

        (3) The Chairperson may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Endowment. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review.

        (b)  The Endowment will assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 percent a year, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.

        (c)  The Endowment will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Endowment.

        (d)  A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.

        (e)  The Endowment may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.

        (f)  (1) The Chairperson may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the Endowment.

        (2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Chairperson's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.

        § 1150.8   Will failure to pay my debt affect my eligibility for Endowment programs?

#### § § 1150.8

        In the event that you fail to pay your debt to the Endowment within a reasonable period of time after the date of the Notice of debt, the General Counsel of the Endowment shall place your name on the Endowment's list of debarred, suspended, and ineligible contractors, grantees, and other participants in programs sponsored by the Endowment. You will be advised of this action.

        § 1150.9   How can I resolve the Endowment's claim through a voluntary repayment agreement?

#### § § 1150.9

        In response to a Notice of debt, you may propose to the Endowment that you be allowed to repay the debt through a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of the Endowment taking other collection actions under this part.

        (a) Your request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement must:

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Admit the existence of the debt; and

        (3) Either propose payment of the debt (together with interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) in a lump sum, or set forth a proposed repayment schedule.

        (b) The Endowment will collect claims in full or one lump sum whenever feasible. However, if you are unable to pay your debt in one lump sum, the Endowment may accept payment in regular installments that bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and your ability to pay.

        (c) The Endowment will consider a request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Chairperson may request additional information from you, including financial statements if you request to make payments in installments, in order to make a determination of whether to accept a voluntary repayment agreement. It is within the Chairperson's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding with other collection actions under this part, and to set the necessary terms of any voluntary repayment agreement. No repayment agreement will be binding on the Endowment unless it is in writing and signed by both you and the Chairperson. At the Endowment's option, you may be required to enter into a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety as part of an agreement to make payments in installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 31 U.S.C. 3711.

        § 1150.10   What is the extent of the Chairperson's authority to compromise debts owed to the Endowment, or to suspend or terminate collection action on such debts?

#### § § 1150.10

        (a) The Chairperson may exercise his or her authority to compromise, or to suspend or terminate collection action on, those debts owed to the Endowment and not exceeding $100,000, excluding interest, in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended; the Federal Claims Collection Standards issued thereunder; and this part, except where standards are established by other statutes or authorized regulations issued pursuant to them.

        (b) The portion of a debt owed to the Endowment that is unrecovered as the result of a compromise shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as income to the debtor.

        § 1150.11   How does subdividing or joining debts owed to the Endowment affect the Chairperson's compromise, suspension, or termination authority?

#### § § 1150.11

        A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract will be considered as a single claim in determining whether the claim is one of not more than $100,000, excluding interest, for the purpose of compromise or suspension or termination of collection action. Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. Joining two or more claims in a demand upon a debtor for payment of more than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or suspension or termination of collection action with regard to any one claim not exceeding $100,000, excluding interest.

        § 1150.12   How will the Endowment use credit reporting agencies to collect its claims?

#### § § 1150.12

        (a) The Endowment may report delinquent debts to appropriate credit reporting agencies by providing the following information:

        (1) A statement that the debt is valid and overdue;

        (2) The name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor;

        (3) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and

        (4) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.

        (b) Before disclosing debt information to a credit reporting agency, the Endowment will:

        (1) Take reasonable action to locate the debtor if a current address is not available;

        (2) Provide the notice required under § 1150.5 if a current address is available; and

        (3) Obtain satisfactory assurances from the credit reporting agency that it complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and other Federal laws governing the provision of credit information.

        (c) At the time debt information is submitted to a credit reporting agency, the Endowment will provide a written statement to the reporting agency that all required actions have been taken. In addition, the Endowment will, thereafter, ensure that the credit reporting agency is promptly informed of any substantive change in the conditions or amount of the debt, and promptly verify or correct information relevant to the debt.

        (d) If a debtor disputes the validity of the debt, the credit reporting agency will refer the matter to the appropriate Endowment official. The credit reporting agency will exclude the debt from its reports until the Endowment certifies in writing that the debt is valid.

        (e) The Endowment may disclose to a commercial credit bureau information concerning a commercial debt, including the following:

        (1) Information necessary to establish the name, address, and employer identification number of the commercial debtor;

        (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and

        (3) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.

        § 1150.13   How will the Endowment contract for collection services?

#### § § 1150.13

        The Endowment will use the services of a private collection contractor where it determines that such use is in the best interest of the Endowment. When the Endowment determines that there is a need to contract for collection services, it will:

        (a) Retain sole authority to:

        (1) Resolve any dispute with the debtor regarding the validity of the debt;

        (2) Compromise the debt;

        (3) Suspend or terminate collection action;

        (4) Refer the debt to the DOJ for litigation; and

        (5) Take any other action under this part which does not result in full collection of the debt;

        (b) Require the contractor to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m); with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692-1692o) and other applicable Federal and State laws pertaining to debt collection practices; and with the applicable regulations of the Endowment in this chapter;

        (c) Require the contractor to account accurately and fully for all amounts collected; and

        (d) Require the contractor to provide to the Endowment, upon request, all data and reports contained in its files related to its collection actions on a debt.

        § 1150.14   When will the Endowment refer claims to the DOJ?

#### § § 1150.14

        The Chairperson will refer to the DOJ for litigation claims on which aggressive collection actions have been taken but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended, or terminated. Referrals will be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive Endowment collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor.

        § 1150.15   Will the Endowment use a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury to collect its claims?

#### § § 1150.15

        (a) The Endowment will enter into a cross-servicing agreement that authorizes the Treasury to take the collection actions described in this part on behalf of the Endowment. These debt collection services will be provided to the Endowment in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37.

        (b) The Endowment shall transfer to the Treasury any past due, legally enforceable, non-tax debt that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so that the Secretary of the Treasury may take appropriate action in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 5 CFR 550.1108, and 31 CFR part 285. The categories of debts described in 31 U.S.C. 3711(g)(2) are excluded from transfer under this paragraph (b).

        § 1150.16   May I use the Endowment's failure to comply with these regulations as a defense?

#### § § 1150.16

        No. The failure of the Endowment to comply with any standard prescribed in the Federal Claims Collection Standards or these regulations shall not be available to any debtor as a defense.

      Subpart B—Salary Offset

        § 1150.20   What debts are included or excluded from coverage of these regulations on salary offset?

#### § § 1150.20

        (a) The regulations in this subpart provide Endowment procedures for the collection by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain debts owed to the Endowment or to other Federal agencies.

        (b) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.

        (c) Nothing in the regulations in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, or the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

        (d) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code takes precedence over a salary offset under this subpart, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).

        (e) This subpart does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of your election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four or fewer pay periods.

        § 1150.21   May I ask the Endowment to waive an overpayment that otherwise would be collected by offsetting my salary as a Federal employee?

#### § § 1150.21

        Yes. The regulations in this subpart do not preclude you from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.

        § 1150.22   What are the Endowment's procedures for salary offset?

#### § § 1150.22

        (a) The Endowment will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.

        (b) If you are an Endowment employee, the Endowment's payroll office will determine the amount of your disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.

        (c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by the Endowment's payroll office of certification of debt from the creditor agency.

        (d) —(1)  If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.

        (2)  Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and your ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless you have agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.

        (3)  A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.

        (4)  If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Endowment, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, then the Endowment may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

        (e) Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Endowment's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.

        § 1150.23   How will the Endowment coordinate salary offsets with other agencies?

#### § § 1150.23

        (a)  Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Endowment must submit a claim to a paying agency.

        (1) In its claim, the Endowment must certify, in writing, the following:

        (i) That the employee owes the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) The date the Endowment's right to collect the debt first accrued; and

        (iv) That the Endowment's regulations in this subpart have been approved by OPM under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

        (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the Endowment's claim will also advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. The Endowment may also advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected and the date of the first installment, if that date is other than the next officially established pay period.

        (3) The Endowment shall also include in its claim:

        (i) The employee's written consent to the salary offset;

        (ii) The employee's signed statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514; or

        (iii) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the actions taken and the dates of those actions.

        (4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, the Endowment must submit its claim to the paying agency for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency will (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and the Endowment. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal government sources, then (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Endowment must submit a properly certified claim under this paragraph (a)(4) to the agency responsible for making the payments before the collection can be made.

        (5) Separated employee. If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Endowment may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be administratively offset to collect the debt.

        (6) Employee transfer. When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, the Endowment will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. The Endowment will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

        (b)  (1) Complete claim. When the Endowment receives a certified claim from a creditor agency (under the creditor agency's regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, the employee will receive a written notice from the Endowment including:

        (i) A statement that the Endowment has received a certified claim from the creditor agency;

        (ii) The amount of the claim;

        (iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin; and

        (iv) The amount of such deductions.

        (2) Incomplete claim. When the Endowment receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Endowment will return the claim with a notice that the creditor agency must comply with the procedures required under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and must properly certify a claim to the Endowment before the Endowment will take action to collect from the employee's current pay account.

        (3) The Endowment is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.

        (4) Employees who transfer from the Endowment to another paying agency. If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim to the Endowment, the employee transfers from the Endowment to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Endowment will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.

        § 1150.24   Under what conditions will the Endowment make a refund of amounts collected by salary offset?

#### § § 1150.24

        (a) If the Endowment is the creditor agency, it will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:

        (1) The debt is waived or all or part of the funds deducted are otherwise found not to be owed (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or

        (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Endowment to make a refund.

        (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section will not bear interest.

        § 1150.25   Will the collection of a claim by salary offset act as a waiver of my rights to dispute the claimed debt?

#### § § 1150.25

        Your involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt under this subpart will not be construed as a waiver of any rights that you may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or other provisions of a law or written contract, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

      Subpart C—Tax Refund Offset

        § 1150.30   Which debts can the Endowment refer to the Treasury for collection by offsetting tax refunds?

#### § § 1150.30

        (a) The regulations in this subpart implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the Treasury to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency.

        (b) For purposes of this section, a past-due, legally enforceable debt referable to the Treasury for tax refund offset is a debt that is owed to the Endowment and:

        (1) Is at least $25.00;

        (2) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months and will not have been delinquent more than 10 years at the time the offset is made;

        (3) Cannot currently be collected under the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514;

        (4) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Endowment against amounts payable to the debtor by the Endowment;

        (5) With respect to which the Endowment has

        (i) given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable,

        (ii) considered evidence presented by the debtor, and

        (iii) determined that an amount of the debt is past due and legally enforceable;

        (6) Has been disclosed by the Endowment to a credit reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) and § 1150.12 of this part, unless the credit reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c;

        (7) With respect to which the Endowment has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor that:

        (i) The debt is past due, and

        (ii) Unless repaid within 60 days of the date of the Notice, the debt may be referred to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax; and

        (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Treasury regulations relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset (31 CFR 285.2) have been satisfied.

        § 1150.31   What are the Endowment's procedures for collecting debts by tax refund offset?

#### § § 1150.31

        (a) The Chairperson will be the point of contact with the Treasury for administrative matters regarding the offset program.

        (b) The Endowment will ensure that the procedures prescribed by the Treasury are followed in developing information about past-due debts and submitting the debts to the Treasury.

        (c) The Endowment will submit to the Treasury a notification of a taxpayer's liability for past-due legally enforceable debt. This notification will contain the following:

        (1) The name and taxpayer identification number of the debtor;

        (2) The amount of the past-due and legally enforceable debt;

        (3) The date on which the original debt became past due; and

        (4) A statement certifying that, with respect to each debt reported, all of the requirements of § 1150.30(b) have been satisfied.

        (d) For purposes of this section, notice that collection of the debt is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving the debtor will bar referral of the debt to the Treasury.

        (e) The Endowment shall promptly notify the Treasury to correct data when it:

        (1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to a debt that has been referred;

        (2) Receives or credits a payment on the debt; or

        (3) Receives notice that the person owing the debt has filed for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.

        (f) When advising debtors of an intent to refer a debt to the Treasury for offset, the Endowment will also advise debtors of remedial actions available to defer the offset or prevent it from taking place.

      Subpart D—Administrative Offset

        § 1150.40   Under what circumstances will the Endowment collect amounts that I owe to the Endowment (or some other Federal agency) by offsetting the debt against payments that the Endowment (or some other Federal agency) owes me?

#### § § 1150.40

        (a) The regulations in this subpart apply to the collection of any debts you owe to the Endowment, or to any request from another Federal agency that the Endowment collect a debt you owe by offsetting your debt against a payment the Endowment owes you. Administrative offset is authorized under Section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3716). The Endowment shall carry out administrative offset in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards; the regulations in this subpart are intended only to supplement the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

        (b) The Chairperson, after attempting to collect a debt you owe to the Endowment under Section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset, subject to the following:

        (1) The debt you owe is certain in amount; and

        (2) It is in the best interest of the Endowment to collect your debt by administrative offset because of the decreased costs of collection and acceleration in the payment of the debt.

        (c) No collection by administrative offset will be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Endowment or a federal agency's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting the debt.

        (d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to:

        (1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly prohibited by statute; or

        (2) Debts owed to the Endowment by Federal agencies.

        § 1150.41   How will the Endowment request that my debt to the Endowment be collected by offset against some payment that another Federal agency owes me?

#### § § 1150.41

        The Chairperson may request that funds due and payable to you by another Federal agency instead be paid to the Endowment to satisfy a debt you owe to the Endowment. In requesting administrative offset, the Endowment will certify in writing to the Federal agency that is holding funds for you:

        (a) That you owe the debt;

        (b) The amount and basis of the debt; and

        (c) That the Endowment has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations in this subpart, and the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards with respect to providing you with due process.

        § 1150.42   What procedures will the Endowment use to collect amounts I owe to a Federal agency by offsetting a payment that the Endowment would otherwise make to me?

#### § § 1150.42

        (a) Any Federal agency may request that the Endowment administratively offset funds due and payable to you in order to collect a debt you owe to that agency. The Endowment will initiate the requested offset only upon:

        (1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:

        (i) That you owe the debt;

        (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;

        (iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and

        (iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, including providing you with any required hearing or review; and

        (2) A determination by the Chairperson that offsetting funds payable to you by the Endowment in order to collect a debt owed by you would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.

        (b)  In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking administrative offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Endowment may, in its discretion, allocate the amount it owes to you to the creditor agencies in accordance with the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

        § 1150.43   When may the Endowment make an offset in an expedited manner?

#### § § 1150.43

        The Endowment may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to you before completion of the procedures required by §§ 1150.41 and 1150.42 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize the Endowment's ability to collect the debt and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. An expedited offset will be followed promptly by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset, but later found not to be owed to the Endowment, will be promptly refunded.

        § 1150.44   Can a judgment I have obtained against the United States be used to satisfy a debt that I owe to the Endowment?

#### § § 1150.44

        Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States will be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.

#### § § 1151.4

        (a) A recipient shall take appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, beneficiaries, applicants, and employees, including those with impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 and this part.

#### § § 1151.5

        (a) Recipients are not excused from complying with this part as a result of state or local laws which limit the eligibility of handicapped persons to receive services or to practice a profession or occupation.

        (b) The presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession does not excuse a recipient from complying with the regulation. For example, a music school receiving Endowment financial assistance could not deny admission to a qualified blind applicant because a blind singer may experience more difficulty than a nonhandicapped singer in finding a job.

          (a) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives federal financial assistance.

          (b) These regulations do not prohibit the exclusion of nonhandicapped persons or persons with a specific type of handicap from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or executive order to handicapped persons or persons with a different type of handicap.

          (c) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to insure that no handicapped individual is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any program or activity receiving Endowment financial assistance because of the absence of appropriate auxiliary aids for individuals with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

          (d) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to insure that communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.

          (1) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

          (2) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

          (3) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;

          (4) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

          (5) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;

          (6) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

          (7) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.

          (b) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in such aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different.

          (c) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:

          (1) That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap;

          (2) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons; or

          (3) That perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same state.

          (d) A recipient may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections:

          (1) That have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives federal financial assistance; or

          (2) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.

          (e) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with federal financial assistance.

          § 1151.18   Illustrative examples.

#### § § 1151.18

          (a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National Endowment for the Arts.

          (1) A museum exhibition catalogue or small press editions supported by the Endowment may be made usable by the blind and the visually impaired through cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and simultaneous publications;

          (2) A theatre performance supported by Federal funds may be made available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use of a sign language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the performance.

          (3) A performing arts organization receiving Federal funds and offering, for example, a specific event in an inaccessible facility may arrange to provide a reasonable opportunity for that specific event to be offered to the public at large in an alternative accessible space; e.g., a theatre offering four different plays a season may offer at least one performance of each play in an alternative accessible space.

          (4) Recipients of federal funds should make every effort to assure that they do not support organizations or individuals that discriminate;

          (5) A handicapped person with experience and expertise equal to qualification standards established by a planning or advisory board may not be excluded from participation on the board on the basis of handicap. This does not mean that every planning or advisory board necessarily must include a handicapped person.

          (b) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different aid, benefits, or services, e.g., periodic performances in alternative accessible spaces, a physically handicapped person who wishes to be, and can be, escorted to a seat, may not be denied such access to an otherwise inaccessible theatre.

          (c) State arts agencies are obligated to develop methods of administering federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.

          (d) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, alter, lease or rent a facility, the aid, benefits, or services provided in or through that facility must be conducted in accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum aid, benefits, or services conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped persons.

          (e) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these implementing regulations recipients should make every effort to administer Endowment assisted programs or activities in a setting in which able-bodied and disabled persons are integrated, e.g., tours made available to the hearing impaired should be open to the public at large and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits of a tactile experience in a museum.

#### § § 1153.149

      Except as otherwise provided in § 1153.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

      § 1153.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1153.150

      (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

      (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

      (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1153.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1153.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1153.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

      (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

      (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

      (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

      (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

      (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

      § 1153.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1153.151

      Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

      (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

      (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

      (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

      (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

      (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

      (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

      (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1153.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

        (1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

        (2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

        (3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

        (4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.

        (b)  A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1156.6 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

        (c)  If a recipient operating a program or activity which serves the elderly or children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits to the elderly or to children the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from participation in the program or activity.

        § 1156.15   Complaints.

#### § § 1156.15

        (b) Complaints must include a written statement identifying the parties involved, describing the alleged violation, and stating the date on which the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation. Complaints must be signed by the complainant. The Endowment will return any complaint that does not contain the necessary information, that is not signed by the complainant, or that is not within the Endowment's jurisdiction for any other reason.

        (2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.

        (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informal judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at least one meeting with the mediator before the Endowment will accept a judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

        (c) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the agreement to wiring. The mediator shall send a copy of the settlement to the Endowment. No further action shall be taken by the Endowment based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient has failed to comply with the agreement.

        (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.

        (e) Not more than 60 days after the Endowment receives the complaint, the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to the Endowment for initial investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before the end of the 60-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be resolved through mediation. The mediator may extend this 60-day period, provided the Endowment concurs, for not more than 30 days, if the mediator determines that resolution is likely to occur within such period.

The Endowment may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

        (3) The Endowment will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at the Endowment.

        (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of the Endowment, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.

        (5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

        (b)  If the Endowment cannot resolve the complaint during the early stages of the investigation, it shall:

        (1) Complete the investigation of the complaint.

        (2) Attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to the Endowment, if the investigation indicates a violation.

        (3) Arrange for enforcement as described in § 1156.19, if necessary.

        (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the Endowment under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act and the regulations in this part. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, a case which is settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the Endowment unless it is reopened because of a violation of the agreement.

        (2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:

        (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or the regulations in this part.

        (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or the regulations in this part.

        (b) The Endowment will limit any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or portion thereof that the Endowment finds in violation of the regulations in this part. The Endowment will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from the Endowment.

        (c) The Endowment will not take action under paragraph (a) of this section until:

        (1) The Chairperson has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and the regulations in this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

        (2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Chairperson has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Chairperson will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) The Chairperson also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from the Endowment to a recipient when a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is initiated.

        (1) New Federal financial assistance from the Endowment includes all assistance for which the Endowment requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from the Endowment does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a termination hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards.

        (2) The Endowment will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Endowment will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Chairperson. The Endowment will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient. If the hearing results in a finding against the recipient, the Endowment must terminate funds.

        (1) The ability to comply with the regulations in this part; and

        (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and the Endowment has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

        (2) The Endowment issues a finding in favor of the recipient.

        (iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not the attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

        (v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section,  shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law r regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

        § 1158.210   Reporting.

#### § § 1158.210

        No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

      Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

        § 1158.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1158.300

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) The reporting requirements in § 1158.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section,  shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

        (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

        § 1158.400   Penalties.

#### § § 1158.400

        (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,119 and not more than $251,322 for each such expenditure.

        (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B of this part) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,119 and not more than $251,322 for each such failure.

        (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

        (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

        (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $25,119, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $25,119 and $251,322, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

        (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

#### § § 1158.500

        (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest.

#### § § 1159.9

      The Endowment shall require reasonable identification of all individuals who request access to records in an Endowment system to ensure that they are disclosed to the proper person.

      (a) The amount of personal identification required will of necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. In general, if you request disclosure in person, you shall be required to show an identification card, such as a driver's license, containing your photograph and sample signature. However, with regard to records in Endowment systems that contain particularly sensitive and/or detailed personal information, the Endowment reserves the right to require additional means of identification as are appropriate under the circumstances.

      (c) The Endowment will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction of a record within 10 business days of its receipt, unless the request can be processed and the individual informed of the General Counsel's decision on the request within that 10-day period.

      (d) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete, based on a preponderance of the evidence, then the record will be corrected or amended promptly. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Endowment function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, you will be informed in writing of the amendment, correction, or deletion. In addition, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.

      (e) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel does not agree that the record should be amended or corrected, you will be informed promptly in writing of the refusal to amend or correct the record and the reason for this decision. You will also be informed that you may appeal this refusal in accordance with § 1159.11 of this part.

      (f) Requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency will be forwarded to such agency for processing, and you will be informed in writing of this referral.

      § 1159.11   How can I appeal a refusal to amend or correct an Endowment record?

#### § § 1159.11

      (a) You may appeal a refusal to amend or correct a record to the Chairperson. Such appeal must be made in writing within 10 business days of your receipt of the initial refusal to amend or correct your record. Your appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1159.3 of this part), should indicate that it is an appeal, and should include the basis for the appeal.

      (b) The Chairperson will review your request to amend or correct the record, the General Counsel's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. No hearing will be held.

      (c) The Chairperson shall render his or her decision on your appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by the Endowment, unless the Chairperson, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Chairperson extend the appeal period, you will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.

      (d) If the Chairperson determines that the record that is the subject of the appeal should be amended or corrected, the record will be so modified, and you will be informed in writing of the amendment or correction. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.

      (e) If your appeal is denied, you will be informed in writing of the following:

      (1) The denial and the reasons for the denial;

      (f) Whenever you submit a statement of disagreement to the Endowment in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the record will be annotated to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of your statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the Endowment deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal may also be disclosed with the record. While you will have access to this statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of your statement of disagreement, as well as any statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal.

      § 1159.12   Will the Endowment charge me fees to locate, review, or copy records?

#### § § 1159.12

      (a) The Endowment shall charge no fees for search time or for any other time expended by the Endowment to review a record. However, the Endowment may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record ( computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to you without cost.

      (b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying ( punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.

      (c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.

      (d) A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Endowment's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.

      (e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the “National Endowment for the Arts.”

The Endowment may also disclose such a record to a law enforcement agency on its own initiative in situations in which criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such disclosure has been established as a routine use, or in situations in which the misconduct is directly related to the purpose for which the record is maintained;

      (8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if, upon such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;

      (9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress, or subcommittee of any such joint committee;

      (b) Before disseminating any record about any individual to any person other than an Endowment employee, the Endowment shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such records are, or at the time they were collected were, accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Endowment purposes. This paragraph (b) does not apply to disseminations made pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      § 1159.14   Will the Endowment maintain a written account of disclosures made from its systems of records?

#### § § 1159.14

      (a) The Office of the General Counsel shall maintain a written log containing the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to another agency. Such accounting shall also contain the name and address of the person or agency to whom each disclosure was made. This log need not include disclosures made to Endowment employees in the course of their official duties, or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

      (b) The Endowment shall retain the accounting of each disclosure for at least five years after the accounting is made or for the life of the record that was disclosed, whichever is longer.

#### § § 1159.15

      The Deputy Chairman for Management and Budget has the responsibility of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained, including all reports and outputs from such systems that contain identifiable personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or destruction of any personal records or data, and must furthermore minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that skilled technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to such records or data.

      (a)  (1) Records contained in a system of records as defined herein may be used, held or stored only where facilities are adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or outside the Endowment.

      (2) All records, when not under the personal control of the employees authorized to use the records, must be stored in a locked metal filing cabinet. Some systems of records are not of such confidential nature that their disclosure would constitute a harm to an individual who is the subject of such record. However, records in this category shall also be maintained in locked metal filing cabinets or maintained in a secured room with a locking door.

      (3) Access to and use of a system of records shall be permitted only to persons whose duties require such access within the Endowment, for routine uses as defined in § 1159.1 as to any given system, or for such other uses as may be provided herein.

      (4) Other than for access within the Endowment to persons needing such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses as defined in § 1159.1, or such other uses as provided herein, access to records within a system of records shall be permitted only to the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written request to the General Counsel.

      (5) Access to areas where a system of records is stored will be limited to those persons whose duties require work in such areas. There shall be an accounting of the removal of any records from such storage areas utilizing a written log, as directed by the Deputy Chairman for Management and Budget. The written log shall be maintained at all times.

      (6) The Endowment shall ensure that all persons whose duties require access to and use of records contained in a system of records are adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.

      (7) The disposal and destruction of records within a system of records shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the General Services Administration.

      (b)  (1) Identifiable personal information may be processed, stored or maintained by automated data systems only where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to such systems in any form. Whenever such data, whether contained in punch cards, magnetic tapes or discs, are not under the personal control of an authorized person, such information must be stored in a locked or secured room, or in such other facility having greater safeguards than those provided for herein.

      (2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose duties require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times, including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.

      (3) All persons whose duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.

      (4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be done by shredding, burning or in the case of tapes or discs, degaussing, in accordance with any regulations now or hereafter proposed by the General Services Administration or other appropriate authority.

      § 1159.16   Will the Endowment take steps to ensure that its employees involved with its systems of records are familiar with the requirements and implications of the Privacy Act?

#### § § 1159.16

      (a) The Chairperson shall ensure that all persons involved in the design, development, operation or maintenance of any Endowment system are informed of all requirements necessary to protect the privacy of subject individuals. The Chairperson shall also ensure that all Endowment employees having access to records receive adequate training in their protection, and that records have adequate and proper storage with sufficient security to assure the privacy of such records.

      (b) All employees shall be informed of the civil remedies provided under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1) and other implications of the Privacy Act, and the fact that the Endowment may be subject to civil remedies for failure to comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act and these regulations.

      § 1159.17   Which of the Endowment's systems of records are covered by exemptions in the Privacy Act?

#### § § 1159.17

      (a) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the Endowment system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except for subsections (b); (c)(1) and (2); (e)(4)(A) through (F); (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11); and (i), insofar as that Endowment system contains information pertaining to criminal law enforcement investigations.

      (b) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Endowment system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that Endowment system consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of the exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).

      (c) The Endowment system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” is exempt from the above-noted provisions of the Privacy Act because their application might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence; disclose investigative techniques or procedures; reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses; or otherwise impair investigations.

      § 1159.18   What are the penalties for obtaining an Endowment record under false pretenses?

#### § § 1159.18

      (a) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3), any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning an individual from the Endowment under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.

      (b) A person who falsely or fraudulently attempts to obtain records under the Privacy Act may also be subject to prosecution under other statutes, including 18 U.S.C. 494, 495, and 1001.

      § 1159.19   What restrictions exist regarding the release of mailing lists?

      § 1160.2   Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities

#### § § 1160.2

      For the purposes of this part (45 CFR part 1160) the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities shall be composed of the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Secretary of Education, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Librarian of Congress, the Chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, the Archivist of the United States, the Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, General Services Administration, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Director of the United States Information Agency, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman of the National Museum Services Board, the Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging.

      § 1160.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1160.3

      For the purposes of this part:

      (a)  means the Federal _Council_ on the Arts and the Humanities as defined in § 1160.2.

      (b)  means an agreement by the Council to provide an indemnity covering a future exhibition subject to compliance with all requirements at the date the indemnity is to be effective.

      (c)  means the owner of an object.

      (d)  means an object which qualifies for coverage under the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act.

      (e)  means a public display of an indemnified items(s) at one or more locations, as approved by the Council, presented by any person, nonprofit agency or institution, or Government, in the United States or elsewhere.

      (f)  means the period of time beginning on the date an indemnified item leaves the place designated by the lender and ending on the termination date.

      (g)  means the contract between the Council and the indemnitee covering loss or damage to indemnified items under the authority of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act.

      (h)  means the party or parties to an indemnity agreement issued by the Council, to whom the promise of indemnification is made.

      (i)  means the location(s) where an exhibition indemnified under this part will be displayed.

      (j)  means the date thirty (30) calendar days after the date specified in the indemnity Certificate by which an indemnified item is to be returned to the place designated by the lender or the date on which the item is actually so returned, whichever date is earlier. (In museum terms this means wall-to-wall coverage.) After 11:59 p.m. on the termination date, the item is no longer covered by the indemnity agreement unless an extension has theretofore been requested by the indemnitee and granted in writing by the Council.

      § 1160.4   Eligibility for international exhibitions.

#### § § 1160.4

      An indemnity agreement for an international exhibition made under these regulations shall cover:

      (a) Eligible items from outside the United States while on exhibition in the United States;

      (b) Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition outside this country, preferably when they are part of an exchange of exhibitions; and

      (c) Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition in the United States, in connection with other eligible items from outside the United States which are integral to the exhibition as a whole.

      (d)(1)  An American art museum is organizing a retrospective exhibition which will include more than 150 works of art by Impressionist painter Auguste Renoir. Museums in Paris and London have agreed to lend 125 works of art, covering every aspect of his career, many of which have not been seen together since the artist's death in 1919. The organizer is planning to include 25 masterpieces by Renoir from American public and private collections. The show will open in Chicago and travel to San Francisco and Washington.

      (2)  This example is a common application for coverage of both foreign- and domestic-owned objects in an international exhibition. The foreign-owned objects are eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (a) of this section, and the domestic-owned objects may be eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (c) of this section if the foreign-owned objects are integral to the purposes of the exhibition as a whole. In reviewing this application, the Federal Council would evaluate the exhibition as a whole and determine whether the loans of 125 foreign-owned objects are integral to the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific significance of the exhibition on Renoir. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.

> [73 FR 21056, Apr. 18, 2008]

      § 1160.5   Eligibility for domestic exhibitions.

#### § § 1160.5

      An indemnity agreement for a domestic exhibition made under these regulations shall cover eligible items from the United States while on Exhibition in the United States.

      (a)(1)  An American museum is undergoing renovation and will be closed to the public for one year. During that time, masterpieces from the collection will go on tour to three other museums in the United States. Many of these works have never been lent for travel, and this will be a unique and the last opportunity for museum visitors in other parts of the country to see them exhibited together. Once the new building opens, they will be permanently installed and dispersed throughout the museum's galleries.

      (2)  (i) This is a straightforward example of a domestic exhibition which would be eligible for consideration for indemnity coverage. Under the previous regulations, eligibility was limited to:

      (A) Exhibitions in the United States of entirely foreign-owned objects;

      (B) Exhibitions outside of the United States of domestic-owned objects; or

      (C) Exhibitions in the United States of both foreign- and domestic-owned objects, with the foreign-owned objects having integral importance to the exhibition.

      (ii) In this example, the Federal Council will consider the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific significance of the proposed domestic exhibition of the domestic-owned objects. It would not be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.

      (b)(1)  An American museum is organizing an exhibition of works by 20th century American artists, which will travel to one other U.S. museum. There are more than 100 objects in the exhibition. The majority of the paintings, drawings and sculpture, valued at more than $500,000,000, are from galleries, museums and private collections in the United States. The organizing curator has selected ten works of art, mostly drawings and preparatory sketches relating to paintings in the exhibition, valued at less than $5,000,000, which will be borrowed from foreign lenders.

      (2)  (i) This example raises the question of whether this applicant should submit an application for indemnity coverage for a domestic exhibition or an international exhibition. If the applicant submitted an application for an international exhibition requesting coverage for only the foreign-owned objects eligible under Section 1160.4(a), the Federal Council would evaluate whether the ten foreign-owned objects further the exhibition's educational, cultural, historical, or scientific purposes. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest. In this case, the applicant would have to insure the loans of the domestic-owned objects by other means.

      (ii) In the case of an application for an international exhibition requesting coverage for both domestic-owned and foreign-owned objects eligible under section 1160.4(a) and (c), the Federal Council would evaluate the exhibition as a whole to determine if the ten foreign-owned objects are integral to achieving the exhibition's educational, cultural, historical, or scientific purposes. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.

      (iii) If the applicant submitted an application for a domestic exhibition, however, only the loans of domestic-owned objects, the highest valued part of the exhibition, would be eligible for coverage. The Federal Council would consider if the U.S. loans were of educational, cultural or historic interest. It would not be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest. In this case, the applicant would have to insure the loans of the foreign-owned objects by other means.

      § 1160.6   Application for indemnification.

#### § § 1160.6

      (a) The time, place, nature and Project Director/Curator of the exhibition for which the indemnity is sought;

      (b) Evidence that the owner and present possessor are willing to lend the eligible items, and both are prepared to be bound by the terms of the indemnity agreement;

      (c) The total value of all items to be indemnified, including a description of each item to be covered by the agreement and each item's value;

      (d) The source of valuations of each item, plus an opinion by a disinterested third party of the valuations established by lenders;

      (e) The significance, and the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific value of the items to be indemnified, and of the exhibition as a whole;

      (2) Shipping arrangements;

      (3) Condition reports at lender's location;

      (4) Condition reports at borrower's location;

      (5) Condition reports upon return of items to lender's location;

      (7) Maximum values to be transported in a single vehicle of transport.

      (g) Insurance arrangements, if any, which are proposed to cover the deductible amount provided by law or the excess over the amount indemnified;

Details should include the date of loss, nature and cause of damage, and appraised value of the damaged items(s) both before and after loss;

      (i) If the application is for an exhibition of loans from the United States, which are being shown outside the United States, the applicant should describe in detail the nature of the exchange of exhibitions of which it is a part if any, including all circumstances surrounding the exhibition being shown in the United States, with particular emphasis on facts concerning insurance or indemnity arrangements.

      (j) Upon proper submission of the above required information an application will be selected or rejected for indemnification by the Council. The review criteria include:

      (1) Review of educational, cultural, historical, or scientific value as required under the provisions of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act;

      (2) Certification by the Secretary of State or his designee that the international exhibition with eligible items under § 1160.4 is in the national interest; and

      (3) Review of the availability of indemnity obligational authority under section 5(b) of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act (20 U.S.C. 974).

      Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

        § 1168.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 1168.200

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

        (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

        (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

        (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

        (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

        (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

        (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

        (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

        (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

        § 1168.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1168.205

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

        § 1168.210   Reporting.

#### § § 1168.210

        No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

      Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

        § 1168.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 1168.300

        (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

        (b) The reporting requirements in § 1168.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

        (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

        (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

        (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

        (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

        § 1168.400   Penalties.

#### § § 1168.400

        (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

        (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

        (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

        (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

        (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

        (g)(1) The penalty amounts provided in table 1 to this paragraph (g) apply to violations of this section that occurred prior to December 31, 2023, with each row listing the penalty amounts for violations that occurred in a particular time frame.

        (2) For violations of this section that occur on or after January 1, 2024, the maximum penalty range which may be assessed under this section is the larger of:

        (i) The amount for the previous calendar year; or

        (ii) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.

        (h) Notice of the maximum penalty amounts which may be assessed under paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) of this section for calendar years after 2023 (calculated using the formula in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) will be published by NEH in the  on an annual basis on or before January 15 of each calendar year.

      § 1169.4   Procedures for determining if an individual is the subject of an NEH record.

#### § § 1169.4

      (a) NEH has published notice of its systems of records in the  and also has made such information available on the privacy program page of the NEH website. Any individual desiring to know whether a specific system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her should address such inquiries in writing to the Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3.

      (b) The written inquiry described in § 1169.4(a) should refer to the specific system or systems of records listed in the NEH Notice of Systems of Records, or describe the type of record in sufficient detail reasonably to identify the relevant system of records.

      (c) At a minimum, the request should contain sufficient identifying information to allow NEH to determine if there is a record pertaining to the individual making the request in a particular system of records. NEH reserves the right to solicit from an individual submitting such inquiry proof of identification, depending upon the sensitivity of the request.

      (d) NEH will attempt to respond to an inquiry regarding whether a record exists within 10 business days of receiving the inquiry, or 10 business days from the time any required identification is established, whichever is later. Such a response will contain or reference the procedures that the individual must follow in order to gain access to any such records.

      § 1169.5   Procedures for acquiring access to NEH records pertaining to an individual.

#### § § 1169.5

      (a) An individual may request access to his or her own records contained within an NEH system of records by writing to the Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3. The individual making the request should include his or her full name, address, email address, and telephone number. The individual making the request should also specifically indicate whether he or she wishes to review such records in person.

      (b) The request for access to a record within a system of records should refer to the specific system or systems of records listed in the NEH Notice of Systems of Records within which NEH may retrieve the individual's records, or describe the type of record in sufficient detail such that NEH may reasonably identify the relevant system of records. The request should further state that it is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. In addition, the request should include any other information which may permit NEH to identify the record for which access is being requested, such as maiden name, dates of employment, etc.

      (c) Where an individual requests records pertaining to himself or herself, NEH will process such request under both these regulations and NEH's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), set forth in 45 CFR part 1171, so as to provide the greatest degree of lawful access.

      (d) Upon receipt of any such request, NEH will determine whether the records identified by the requester exist and whether they are subject to any exemption under § 1169.10. Should NEH determine that the records are releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations, and upon verifying the individual's identity per § 1169.6, NEH will provide access to copies of the records by transmitting them to the requester at the mailing or email address provided by the requester, or by permitting the requester to inspect the records at NEH's offices should the requester ask for in-person inspection or where the requester is a current NEH employee.

      (e) NEH will acknowledge a request for access as soon as practicable, and in no event in less than 5 business days. Consistent with the agency's FOIA regulations, NEH will otherwise substantively answer a request for access in no less than 20 business days, except when NEH determines otherwise, in which case NEH will inform the person making the request of the reasons for the delay and the estimated date by which NEH will answer the request. When NEH can answer the request within 20 business days, the response shall include the following:

      (1) A statement that there is no record as requested or a statement that there is no such record in the systems of records maintained by NEH;

      (2) A statement as to whether NEH will grant access by providing a copy of the record through the mail or email; or, where an individual requests in-person inspection, the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the person requesting access is unable to meet the specified date and time, he or she may make alternative arrangements with NEH;

      (3) The amount of fees charged, if any (see § 1169.9);

      (4) Any documentation required by NEH to verify the identity of the person making the request.

      (f) NEH will provide only one copy of each requested record, based on the fee schedule in § 1169.9.

      (g) Per 5 U.S.C. 552a(h), a parent of a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may act on behalf of the minor to gain access to any record pertaining to the minor maintained by NEH in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the presentation of the documents authorizing the legal guardian to so act, and upon suitable personal identification of the guardian.

      (h) In the event NEH gains access to a record by permitting in-person inspection, the individual to which the record pertains may be accompanied by a person of his or her choice to review the record. Under such circumstances, NEH may require that the individual who is the subject of the record furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of the record in the accompanying person's presence.

      (i) In accordance with this provision, NEH will disclose medical or psychological records pertaining to an individual to whom they pertain unless NEH determines, in consultation with a physician, that disclosure of such records might adversely affect the individual to whom they pertain. Under these circumstances, NEH will disclose this information to a licensed physician designated by such individual in writing.

      § 1169.6   Identification required when requesting access to NEH records pertaining to an individual.

#### § § 1169.6

      (a) Before granting access to personal information under the Privacy Act, NEH may require that the individual requesting such access provide reasonable proof of his or her identity.

      (b) Except in the case of NEH employees and those individuals who request in-person inspection, NEH generally will endeavor to provide access to records via mail or email. In such instances, NEH will first confirm that the physical and/or email addresses provided by the requester match those contained with the NEH system of records. Depending upon the sensitivity of the records requested, and whether the addresses match as described in the preceding sentence, NEH may also request that the individual verify his or her identity by providing certain minimum identifying data, such as date or place of birth and/or copies of a valid driver's license or passport. Where the information sought is of a particularly sensitive nature, and/or where the individual cannot provide minimum identifying data, NEH may require that the individual seeking access submit a notarized statement of identity or a signed statement asserting and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000.

      (c) NEH will provide access by in-person examination to NEH employees as well as to individuals who specifically request disclosure in person. In such instances, the individual requesting disclosure may prove identity by producing an employee identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass used for routine identification purposes. If the individual is unable to provide suitable documentation or identification, NEH may require that he or she stipulate, in writing, that knowingly or willingly seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.

      (d) Identity verification procedures shall not:

      (1) Be so complicated as to discourage unnecessarily individuals from seeking access to information about themselves;

      (2) Be required of an individual seeking access to records that normally would be available under FOIA (see 45 CFR part 1171);

      (3) Require, as a condition to access, the provision of a social security number, unless a social security number is the only means by which NEH may retrieve the records that are the subject of the request.

      (4) Require that the individual explain or justify his or her need for access to any record under this part.

      § 1169.7   Procedures for amending or correcting an individual's NEH record.

#### § § 1169.7

      (a) Individuals are entitled to request amendments or corrections of records pertaining to themselves pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Normally, amendments to this part are limited to correcting factual matters and not matters of official judgment, such as grant proposal evaluations, performance ratings, promotion potential, and job performance appraisals. An individual seeking action under this provision bears the burden of demonstrating to NEH that a record should be amended or corrected.

      (b) Individuals may request the amendment of records pertaining to themselves by submitting a letter in writing to the NEH Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3. Such letter shall include the following information:

      (1) Identification of the particular record to be amended or corrected;

      (2) The NEH system from which the record was retrieved;

      (3) The precise correction or amendment sought, preferably in the form of an edited copy of the record reflecting the desired modification;

      (4) Reasons for requesting amendment or correction of the record, including copies of available documentary evidence supporting the request, where applicable.

      (c) NEH will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction as soon as practicable, and in no event less than 5 business days.

      (d) When NEH has previously verified the individual's identity pursuant to § 1169.6(b) or § 1169.6(c), it will not require further verification of identity so long as the request for amendment or correction does not suggest a need for additional verification. If NEH has not previously verified the individual's identity, it may require that the individual validate his or her identity as described in § 1169.6(b) or § 1169(c).

      (e) To the extent possible, NEH will render a decision upon a request to amend a record no less than 20 business days after receiving such a request. In the event NEH cannot render a decision within that time frame, it will so inform the individual who made the request and provide an expected date for a decision. Any such decision will include the following information:

      (1) NEH's decision whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of, the request to amend or correct the record;

      (2) The reasons for the determination for any portion of the request which is denied;

      (3) A statement that any denial may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 1169.8; and

      (4) The name and address of the official to whom an individual may submit an appeal of denial.

      (f) NEH will forward requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency to such agency for processing, and inform the person who submitted such request in writing of its referral.

      § 1169.8   The appeals process.

#### § § 1169.8

      (a) An individual whose request for access to, or correction or amendment of, a record is initially denied by NEH and who wishes to appeal that denial may do so by sending a letter within 90 days of receipt of the initial denial to the Chairperson. If an appeal concerns records retrieved from the OIG's Investigative Files, the OIG will act on the appeal and will carry out all responsibilities with respect to Privacy Act appeals otherwise assigned to the Chairperson under this section.

      (b) The appeal letter must:

      (1) Specify the records subject to the appeal;

      (2) Include the information specified in § 1169.7(b);

      (3) Include copies of the correspondence from NEH in which it initially denied the request for access, or for amendment or correction; and

      (4) Explain why NEH's denial of access, amendment or correction was erroneous.

      (c) Appeals should be directed to the NEH Office of the General Counsel at the physical address or email address identified in § 1169.3. The Office of the General Counsel will refer the appeal letter to the Chairperson (or his or his or her designee), or in the case of records retrieved from NEH's OIG Investigative Files, will refer the appeal letter to the NEH OIG.

      (d) The Chairperson will review the initial request for access to, or amendment or correction of, the record, NEH's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. NEH will not hold a hearing on the appeal.

      (e) The Chairperson will render a final decision on the appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by NEH, unless the Chairperson, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Chairperson extend the 30-day period, NEH will inform the requester of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.

      (f) In conducting appeals under this provision, the Chairperson will be guided by the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) and (e)(5).

      (g) NEH will notify a requester, in writing, when the Chairperson determines to grant an appeal in whole or in part, and will grant the requester access to his or her record, or correct or amend the record, in accordance with the Chairperson's determination.

      (h) When the Chairperson determines to deny an appeal, in whole or in part, NEH will notify the requester in writing of the following:

      (1) The basis for the decision;

      (2) That the requester may submit to NEH a concise statement setting forth the reasons for disagreeing with NEH's decision.

      (3) The procedures for filing such statement of disagreement.

      (4) That, in a case where the Chairperson refuses a request to amend or correct a record, NEH will make such statements of disagreement available in subsequent disclosures of the record, together with a statement from NEH (if deemed appropriate) summarizing the agency's refusal.

      (5) The requester's right to seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(a).

NEH has implemented this exemption because application of these provisions of the Privacy Act might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence; disclose investigative techniques or procedures; reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses; or otherwise impair investigations.

      (b) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the NEH system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that NEH system consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of the exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).

      (c) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the NEH system entitled “Grants and Cooperative Agreements: Electronic Grant Management System” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that NEH system consists of materials which would reveal the identity of references for fellowship or grant applicants.

      (d) Records on applicants for employment at NEH are covered by the Office of Personnel Management government-wide system notice “Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records.” These records are exempted as claimed in 5 CFR 297.501(b)(7).

      (e) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5), nothing within these regulations shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

      (f) NEH may also assert exemptions for records received from another agency that could properly be claimed by that agency in responding to a request.

      § 1169.11   Penalties for obtaining an NEH record under false pretenses.

#### § § 1169.11

      Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3), any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record from NEH concerning an individual under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.

        (b) A recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different aid, benefits, or services.

        (c) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration.

        (1) that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap,

        (d) A recipient may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections

        (1) that have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance or

        § 1170.13   Illustrative examples.

#### § § 1170.13

        (a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

        (1) A publication or a museum catalogue supported by the Endowment may be made usable by the blind and the visually impaired through cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and simultaneous publications.

        (2) A lecture, meeting or symposium supported by Federal funds may be made available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use of a sign language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the performance.

        (3) Specific aid, benefits, or services supported by Federal funds may be offered in an inaccessible facility provided that the same aid, benefit, or service is also offered to the public at large in an accessible space.

        (4) A qualified handicapped person is one who is able to meet all requirements in spite of his handicap. An educational institution is not required to disregard the disabilities of handicapped individuals or to lower or to make substantial modifications of standards to accommodate a handicapped person.

        (b) State humanities committees are obligated to develop methods of administering Federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.

        (c) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, alter, lease or rent a facility, the benefits of the program or activity provided in or through that facility must be conducted in accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum aid, benefits, or services conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped persons.

        (d) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these implementing regulations recipients should administer Endowment assisted programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate, e.g., tours made available to the hearing impaired should be open to the public at large and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits of a tactile experience in a museum.

        (1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and

        (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria are unavailable.

        (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or other factors relevant to adequate performance of the job in question.

        § 1170.24   Preemployment inquiries.

#### § § 1170.24

        (a) A recipient may not, except as provided below, conduct a preemployment medical examination, make preemployment inquiry as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person, or inquire as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.

        (b) If a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination, if a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or if a recipient is taking affirmative action under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, that:

        (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and

        (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

        (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided, that:

        (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap; and

        (2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.

        (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:

#### § § 1170.32

        (a)  A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

        (b)  A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 1170.33, or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

        (c)  A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

        (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within one year of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes.

A copy of the transition plan shall be made available upon request for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:

        (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;

        (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

        (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.

        (e)  The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.

        (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.

        (3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

        (ii) Alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Chairman to be available.

        (3) Shall assure itself that:

        (i) Admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure);

        (ii) Admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and

        (iii) Admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and

        (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.

        (c)  When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 1170.52(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 1170.52(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, that:

        (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and

        (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

        (d)  For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.

        (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers participation by students in education programs or activities not operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified handicapped persons.

        (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.

        (a)  A recipient to which this subpart applies shall make such modifications to its academic requirements as are necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted.

        (b)  A recipient to which this subpart applies may not impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibitation of tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the recipient's education program or activity.

        (c)  In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

        (d)  (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

        (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.

        (ii) Assist any entity or person that provides assistance to any of the recipient's students in a manner that discriminates against qualified handicapped persons on the basis of handicap.

        (2) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established under wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments that require awards to be made on the basis of factors that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap only if the overall effect of the award of scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.

        (b)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in providing employment opportunities to any of its students shall assure itself that such employment opportunities, as a whole, are made available in a manner that would not violate subpart C if they were provided by the recipient.

        (c)  A recipient that employs any of its students may not do so in a manner that violates subpart C.

        § 1170.47   Nonacademic services.

#### § § 1170.47

        (a)  (1) In providing physical education courses and athletics and similar aid, benefits, or services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation in these activities.

        (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different only if separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of § 1170.43(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.

        (b)  A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual information about licensing and certification requirements that may present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular careers.

        (c)  A recipient that provides significant assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall assure itself that the membership practices of such organizations do not permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

      Subpart F—Enforcement

        § 1170.51   Assurances required.

#### § § 1170.51

        (a)  An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified by the responsible Endowment official, that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to the Endowment.

        (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

        (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

        (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

        (c)  (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Endowment, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

        (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.

        (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Endowment, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Endowment to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or to otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Endowment official may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

        (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, the Chairman, where appropriate, may require either or both recipients to take remedial action.

        (3) The Chairman may, where necessary to overcome the effects of discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a recipient to take remedial action:

        (ii) With respect to handicapped persons who would have been participants in the program or activity had the discrimination not occurred.

        (b)  A recipient may take steps, in addition to any action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.

        (c) A recipient shall within one year of the effective date of this part:

        (1) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not or may not meet the requirements of this part;

        (2) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this part;

      § 1171.1   About the National Endowment for the Humanities.

#### § § 1171.1

      The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was established by the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. 951  and is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. The NEH is directed by a Chairman and has an advisory council composed of twenty-six presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed members.

      § 1171.2   General provisions.

#### § § 1171.2

      This part contains the regulations the NEH follows in processing requests for NEH records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The NEH also follows these regulations to process all FOIA requests made to the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (FCAH), an organization established by the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 for which the NEH provides legal counsel. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA and OMB's Free Guidelines, which provides additional information about access to NEH and FCAH records. FOIA applies to requests for records concerning the general activities of the government and of the NEH in particular. When individuals seek records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, NEH processes those requests under both NEH's Privacy regulations at part 1115 of this chapter, and this part. Although requests are considered either FOIA requests or Privacy Act requests, agencies process requests in accordance with both laws, which provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal privacy.

      § 1171.3   Information policy.

#### § § 1171.3

      The NEH may provide information the agency routinely makes available to the public through its regular activities (for example, program announcements and solicitations, press releases, and summaries of awarded grant applications) without following this part. As a matter of policy, the NEH makes discretionary disclosures of records or information otherwise exempt under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy, however, does not create any right enforceable in court.

      § 1171.4   Public availability of records.

#### § § 1171.4

      (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the NEH will make the following records available for public inspection in an electronic format (unless they are published and copies are offered for sale) without a FOIA request:

      (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made in the adjudication of cases,

      (2) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the ,

      (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public,

      (4) Copies of all records, regardless of format, which have been released to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and which because of their subject matter, the NEH determines have become or are likely to become subject to subsequent requests for substantially the same records, or have been requested three (3) or more times; and

      (5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) The NEH will also maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format current indexes as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) of the FOIA. However, since the NEH has determined that publication and distribution of these indexes is unnecessary and impracticable, the NEH will provide these indexes upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of the duplication.

      (c) NEH proactively identifies records of interest to the public, such as past awards, press releases, grant guidelines, and grant terms and conditions, and makes these records available on the NEH's Web site at  In addition, copies of the NEH's policy statements, information about the NEH's FOIA program, sample grant narratives, and other frequently requested records are available in the NEH's Electronic Library.

      § 1171.5   Requests for records.

#### § § 1171.5

      (a)  Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your full name, mailing address, daytime telephone number. If you choose to submit your request on the NEH Web site, the request must also include your email address. Your request should be clearly identified as a FOIA request in both the text of the request and on the envelope (or on the facsimile or in the subject heading of an email message) and must describe the requested records in enough detail to enable NEH staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The NEH has no obligation to answer questions posed as FOIA requests or to create records to satisfy a FOIA request.

      (b)  If you make a FOIA request, the NEH will consider it an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under this part, subject to the fee limitations of § 1171.11(d). When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.

      (c)  (1) For NEH records (except NEH Office of the Inspector General records) and/or FCAH records, write to: The General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW., Room 4060, Washington, DC, 20506. You may also send your request to the NEH General Counsel by facsimile at 202-606-8600, by email at  or through the NEH's electronic FOIA request system, which is available on the NEH Web site at

      (2) For NEH Office of the Inspector General records, write to: The Inspector General, Office of the Inspector General, National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW., Room 2200, Washington, DC 20506. You may also send your request to the Inspector General by facsimile at 202-606-8329 or by email at

      § 1171.6   Responsibilities for processing and responding to requests.

#### § § 1171.6

      (a)  The NEH Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is the central office for processing requests for records, except when it's necessary for the NEH Office of Inspector General (OIG) to process a request to maintain the OIG's independence or ability to carry out its statutorily mandated duties. If the request is for OIG records, the NEH will inform the requester which office will be processing the request.

      (b)  The NEH General Counsel (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests for NEH records (excluding requests for OIG records), and/or FCAH records. The NEH Deputy Inspector General (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests for OIG records. The NEH General Counsel (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests on any fee matters and requests for expedited treatment, including OIG-related requests.

      (c)  When the NEH receives a request for a record in its possession, the agency will determine whether another Federal government agency is better able to decide whether the record should or should not be disclosed under the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.

      (1) If the NEH determines that it is the agency best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so, after consultation with the other agency that has a substantial interest in the requested records.

      (2) If the NEH determines that it is not the agency best able to process the record, then it will refer the record (or portion thereof) to the other Federal agency, but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA.

      (d)  Whenever the NEH refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the NEH will notify the requester of the referral, provide the name of the agency to which the referral was directed, and include that agency's FOIA contact information. NEH will notify the requester of the part of the request that has been referred, unless such notification would disclose information otherwise exempt. If notification to the requester about the referral would cause a harm meant to be protected against by the FOIA, NEH will coordinate with the agency rather than referring the records to it.

      § 1171.7   Timing of responses to requests.

#### § § 1171.7

      (a)  The NEH customarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the NEH will include only those records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the NEH will inform the requester of that date.

      (b)  Ordinarily, the NEH will determine whether to grant or deny a request for records within twenty (20) days (weekends and Federal holidays excluded) of when the NEH receives a request.

      (c)  The NEH may toll the 20-day time period to:

      (1) Make one request for information it reasonably requests from the requester; or

      (2) Clarify the applicability or amount of any fees, if necessary, with the requester.

      (3) Under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, the tolling period ends upon the NEH's receipt of the information or clarification from the requester.

      (d)  (1) When the NEH cannot meet the statutory time limits for processing a request because of unusual circumstances as defined in the FOIA, the NEH may extend the response time as follows:

      (i) If the extension will be for ten (10) or fewer working days (i.e., weekends and Federal holidays excluded), the NEH will notify the requester as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and the expected response date; and

      (ii) If the extension will be for more than ten (10) working days, the NEH will provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limit or to arrange an alternative time period to process the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, NEH shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the agency, and shall notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

      (2) If the NEH reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, the NEH may aggregate the requests. The NEH will not aggregate multiple requests involving unrelated matters.

      (e)  (1) The NEH will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it determines that they involve:

      (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (ii) An urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal government activity if the expedited processing request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.

      (2) A requester may seek expedited processing at the time of the requester's initial request for records or at any later time.

      (3) To request expedited processing, a requester must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the requester's best knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.

      (4) Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the NEH will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If the NEH grants a request for expedited processing, the NEH will place the request in the expedited processing track and then process the request as soon as practicable. If the NEH denies a request for expedited processing, the NEH will act upon any appeal of that decision expeditiously.

      § 1171.8   Responses to requests.

#### § § 1171.8

      (a)  Upon receipt of a request that will take longer than ten (10) days to process, the NEH will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that assigns the request an individualized tracking number.

      (b)  If the NEH makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing of such determination and the reasons therefore, and the requester's right to seek assistance from NEH's FOIA Public Liaison. The NEH will inform the requester of any applicable fees and will disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fees. The NEH will mark or annotate records disclosed in part to show the amount of information deleted pursuant to a FOIA exemption, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption. If technically feasible, the NEH will also indicate, on the agency record(s) it provides, the location of the information deleted.

      (c)  If the NEH makes a determination to deny a request in any respect, the NEH will also notify the requester in writing of:

      (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;

      (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the NEH in denying the request;

      (3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, if applicable, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletion on the records disclosed in part, or if providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

      (4) The requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from NEH's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services; and

      (5) A statement that the requester may appeal the denial under § 1171.10 and a description of the requirements to appeal.

      § 1171.9   Confidential commercial information.

#### § § 1171.9

      (a)  The NEH will not disclose confidential commercial information in response to a FOIA request, except as described in this section.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by the NEH from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

      (2)  means any person or entity from whom the NEH obtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.

      (c)  A submitter of confidential commercial information will use good-faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.

      (d)  (1) The NEH will give notice to a submitter whenever:

      (i) The submitter, in good faith, has designated the requested information as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (ii) The NEH has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.

      (2) The notice will either describe the confidential commercial information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the NEH may make notice by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.

      (e)  The notice requirements of this section will not apply if:

      (1) The NEH determines that the requested information is exempt under the FOIA;

      (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

      (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the NEH will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

      (f)  (1) The NEH will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written statement to the NEH specifying all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA. If the submitter relies on Exemption 4 as a basis of nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

      (2) The NEH will consider a submitter who fails to respond with the time period specified on the notice to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The NEH will not consider information it receives from a submitter after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this section may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (g)  The NEH will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential commercial information. Whenever the NEH decides to disclose confidential commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the NEH will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

      (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time after the notice.

      (h)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the NEH will promptly notify the submitter.

      (i)  The NEH will notify the requester whenever the NEH provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever the NEH notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

      § 1171.10   Administrative appeals.

      (b)  The Deputy Chairman (or designee) or the Inspector General (or designee) will make a written determination on your appeal within twenty (20) days (weekends and Federal holidays excluded) after the agency receives your appeal, except as provided by 1171.7(d). If the appeal decision affirms the denial of your request, the NEH will notify you in writing of the reason(s) for the decision, including the applicable FOIA exemption(s), and inform you of the FOIA provisions for court review of the decision. If the denial of your request is reversed or modified, in whole or in part, the NEH will reprocess your request in accordance with that appeal decision and notify you of that decision in writing. A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the 2007 amendments to FOIA created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road—OGIS, College Park, MD 20740;  email:  telephone: 202-741-5770; facsimile: 202-741-5769; toll-free: 1-877-684-6448.

      (c)  If you wish to seek review by a court of any denial by the NEH, you must first submit a timely administrative appeal to the NEH.

      § 1171.11   Fees.

#### § § 1171.11

      (a)  The NEH will assess fees for processing FOIA requests in accordance with this section and with the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget at 52 FR 10012 (Mar. 27, 1987). In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the NEH may contact a requester for additional information. The NEH ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the NEH has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the NEH will provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.

      (2)  means those expenses that an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. _Direct costs_ include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.

      (3)  means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records among others.

      (4)  means any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.

      (5)  means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use or to promote any particular product or industry, but are sought to further scientific research.

      (6)  means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or by subscription or by free distribution to the general public. The NEH will regard “freelance” journalists as working for a news-media organization if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication though that organization. A publication contract would provide the clearest evidence, but the NEH will also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.

      (7)  means the process of examining a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. _Review_ includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. It also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1171.9, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. Review costs are recoverable even if the NEH ultimately does not disclose a record.

      (8)  means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records. The NEH will ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.

      (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, the NEH will charge the following fees for requests, subject to paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section:

      (1)  (i) The NEH will charge $4.00 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record. When clerical personnel cannot perform the search and retrieval (e.g. identification of records within scope of request requires professional personnel), the NEH will charge $7.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional personnel. Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee will be $10.00 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel. The NEH may charge for time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive records or if it determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

      (ii) For computer searches of records, the NEH will charge the actual direct cost of conducting the search.

      (2)  The fee for a photocopy of a record on one-side of an 8  × 11 inch sheet of paper is ten cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, the NEH will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. For other forms of duplication, the NEH will charge the direct costs of that duplication. The NEH will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the NEH in the form or format requested.

      (3)  The NEH will charge review fees to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review (i.e., the review the NEH conducted to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request stage). No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage for exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if the NEH re-reviews the records for the applicability of other exemptions that it did not previously consider, then the costs for the subsequent review are assessable. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(i). The NEH may charge for review even if it ultimately decides not to disclose a record.

      (d)  (1) Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use, the NEH will provide without charge:

      (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and

      (ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).

      (2) When, after first deducting the 100 pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, the total fee is $25.00 or less for any request, the NEH will not charge a fee.

      (3) If NEH fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

      (i) If NEH has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and NEH has provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten (10) working days.

      (ii) If NEH has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, NEH may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, may charge duplication fees, provided NEH provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and NEH discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

      (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (e)  There are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The NEH will assess fees for these categories of requesters as follows:

      (1)  The NEH will charge the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.

      (2)  The NEH will charge for duplication only, excluding costs for the first 100 pages.

      (3)  The NEH will charge for duplication only, excluding costs for the first 100 pages.

      (4)  The NEH will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records, excluding costs for the first 100 pages and the first two hours of search time.

      (f)  (1) The NEH will furnish responsive records without charge or at a reduced charge if it determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and

      (ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) To determine whether the first fee requirement is met, the NEH will consider the following factors:

      (i) The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

      (ii) The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of information already in the public domain, in either duplicative or substantially identical form, is unlikely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will ordinarily be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.

      (iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The NEH will make no value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.

      (3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, the NEH will consider the following factors:

      (i) The NEH will identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

      (ii) A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure.

      (4) Where only some of the requested records satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver will be granted for those records.

      (5) Requesters should make fee waiver or reduction requests when they first submit a FOIA request to the NEH. Fee waiver or reduction requests should address the factors listed in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section. Fee waiver or reduction requests may be submitted at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal.

      (g)  (1) When the NEH determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the actual or estimated fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If the NEH can only readily estimate a portion of the fees, it will advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.

      (2) The notice will offer the requester an opportunity to confer with NEH personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost and inform the requester of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if applicable. A commitment by the requester to pay the anticipated fee must be in writing and must be received by the NEH within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notification of the fee estimate. Until the requester agrees to pay the anticipated fee, the NEH will not consider the request as received by the agency and no further work will be done on the request. If a requester fails to respond within this timeframe, the NEH will administratively close the request.

      (h)  When the NEH chooses, in its sole discretion, to provide a requested special service (e.g. certifying that records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail), it will charge the direct costs of providing the service to the requester.

      (i)  The NEH may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. The NEH will assess interest charges at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and such charges will accrue from the billing date until the NEH receives payment from the requester. The NEH will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (j)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section, the NEH will not require the requester to make an advance payment before it commences or continues work on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (2) When the NEH determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester that has a history of prompt payment.

      (3) When a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged fee to the NEH within thirty (30) days of the billing date, the NEH may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the NEH begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.

      (4) When there is an advance payment request, the NEH will not consider the request as received by the agency and no further work will be done on the request until the required payment is received. If the requester fails to respond within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the advance payment request, the NEH will administratively close the request.

      (k)  When the NEH reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the NEH may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The NEH may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the NEH will aggregate them only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. The NEH will not aggregate multiple requests involving unrelated matters.

      § 1171.12   Preservation of records.

#### § § 1171.12

      NEH will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by the agency's General Records Schedule of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or other NARA-approved records schedule. Records will not be disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the Act.

      § 1171.13   Other rights and services.

#### § § 1171.13

        The purpose of this part is to set out the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) policies and procedures for implementing the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6101  (the Act or the Age Act). The Act is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part. The regulations in this part are based upon the general, government-wide age discrimination regulations issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at 45 CFR part 90. Complaints of employment discrimination based on age may be subject to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621  (ADEA) and should be filed administratively with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (29 CFR part 1626).

        § 1172.2   Application.

#### § § 1172.2

        (a) The Act and the regulations in this part apply to each recipient and to any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the NEH.

        (b) The Act does not apply to:

        (1) Any age distinction contained in that part of a Federal, State or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body which:

        (i) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons based on age;

        (ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or

        (iii) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related terms.

        (2) Any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or with respect to any labor-management joint apprenticeship training program.

        (3) The rights or responsibilities of any person or party pursuant to the ADEA, the EEOC regulations under the ADEA, or any statements of policy promulgated by the EEOC under the ADEA.

      Subpart B—Standards for Determining Age Discrimination

        § 1172.11   Rules against age discrimination.

#### § § 1172.11

        The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions contained in § 1172.12.

        (a)  No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

        (b)  A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements use age distinctions or take any other actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:

        (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, or

        (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

        (c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list of discriminatory actions.

        § 1172.12   Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.

#### § § 1172.12

        (a)  A recipient may take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1172.11 if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:

        (1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics;

        (2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity;

        (3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

        (4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.

        (b)  A recipient may take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1172.11 which is based on a reasonable factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a reasonable factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

        (c)  Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects or conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.

        (d)  If a recipient operating a program or activity provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program or activity, notwithstanding the provisions of § 1172.12(a).

        (e)  Any age distinction in a regulation issued by NEH is presumed to be necessary to the achievement of a statutory objective of the program or activity to which the regulation applies, notwithstanding the provisions of § 1172.12(a).

        § 1172.13   Burden of proof.

#### § § 1172.13

        The recipient of Federal financial assistance bears the burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in § 1172.12.

      Subpart C—Responsibilities of NEH Recipients

        § 1172.21   General responsibilities.

#### § § 1172.21

        A recipient has responsibility to ensure that its programs or activities are in compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part and to take steps to eliminate violations of the Act and the regulations in this part. A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and afford NEH access to its records to the extent NEH finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part.

        § 1172.22   Notice to subrecipients.

#### § § 1172.22

        Where a recipient passes on Federal financial assistance from NEH to subrecipients, the recipient must provide the subrecipients with written notice of their obligations under the Act and the regulations in this part. Each recipient must also make necessary information available to its beneficiaries in order to inform them about the protections against discrimination provided by the Act and the regulations in this part.

        § 1172.23   Self-evaluation.

#### § § 1172.23

        As part of a compliance review under § 1172.31 or a complaint investigation under § 1172.34, NEH may require a recipient employing the equivalent of fifteen (15) or more full time employees to complete a written self-evaluation, in a manner specified by NEH, of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. A recipient must take corrective and remedial action whenever a self-evaluation indicates a violation of the Act, and the recipient must make the self-evaluation available upon request to NEH and to the public for a period of three (3) years following its completion.

        § 1172.24   Information requirements.

#### § § 1172.24

        Each recipient shall keep records containing information necessary for NEH to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part, and shall provide any such records to NEH upon request and in the preferred format specified by NEH. Each recipient shall also permit reasonable access by NEH to its books, records, accounts, and other facilities and sources of information, to the extent necessary for NEH to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act and this part.

      Subpart D—Investigation, Conciliation, and Enforcement Procedures

        § 1172.31   Compliance reviews.

#### § § 1172.31

        (a) NEH may conduct compliance reviews, pre-award reviews, and other similar procedures in order to investigate and correct violations of the Act and the regulations in this part. NEH may conduct these reviews even in the absence of a complaint against the recipient. Reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a recipient is in compliance with the Act and this part.

        (b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation of the Act and the regulations in this part, NEH will attempt to contact the recipient and achieve the recipient's voluntary compliance. If the recipient does not comply voluntarily, NEH may pursue enforcement efforts as described in § 1172.36.

        § 1172.32   Complaints.

#### § § 1172.32

        (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with NEH, alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act and the regulations in this part based on an action occurring on or after July 1, 1979. A complainant must file a complaint in writing within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date that the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause, NEH may extend this time limit. NEH will consider the date a complaint is filed as the date when the complaint is sufficient to be processed.

        (b) Complaints must include a written and signed statement identifying the parties involved, describing the alleged violation, and stating the date on which the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation.

        (c) NEH will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures, as appropriate:

        (1) Widely disseminating information regarding the obligations of recipients under the Act and this part,

        (2) Permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint,

        (3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure, and/or

        (4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact NEH for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.

        (d) NEH will return any complaint that is unsigned or that is not within NEH's jurisdiction for any other reason, and NEH will provide an explanation for the return.

        § 1172.33   Mediation.

#### § § 1172.33

        (a)  Unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception, NEH will promptly refer all complaints that fall within the jurisdiction of the regulations in this part, and that contain all information necessary for further processing, to the Mediation Agency designated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

        (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement, or for the mediator to make an informed judgment that an agreement is impossible.

        (c) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, the mediator shall prepare a mediation agreement in writing, to be signed by the complainant and recipient, and send a copy of the signed agreement to NEH. NEH will take no further action based on that complaint unless the complainant or the recipient has failed to comply with the agreement.

        (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process, and no mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.

        (e) If the complainant and recipient do not reach a mutually satisfactory resolution during mediation within sixty (60) days after NEH receives the complaint, the mediator shall return the complaint to NEH for investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before the end of the sixty-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be resolved through mediation or if an agreement is reached. The mediator may extend this sixty-day period, provided NEH concurs, for not more than thirty (30) days, if the mediator determines that resolution is likely to occur within such period.

        § 1172.34   Investigation.

#### § § 1172.34

        (a)  (1) NEH will investigate complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement.

        (i) As part of this initial investigation, NEH will use informal fact-finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and the recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. NEH may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

        (ii) NEH will put any settlement agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and NEH. The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

        (2) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of NEH, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.

        (b)  If NEH cannot resolve the complaint during the initial investigation, it will complete the investigation of the complaint and make a formal finding. If the formal investigation indicates a violation of the Act or the regulations in this part, NEH will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. If NEH cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin appropriate enforcement action as provided in § 1172.36.

        § 1172.35   Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

#### § § 1172.35

        A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation against any person who attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or this part, or cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, or other part of NEH's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.

        § 1172.36   Enforcement procedure.

#### § § 1172.36

        (a) NEH may enforce the Act and the regulations in this part through:

        (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or the regulations in this part. Prior to such termination, a recipient must have the opportunity for a hearing on record before an administrative law judge who must determine that a violation has occurred. Therefore, NEH will not terminate a recipient's Federal financial assistance in a case that has been settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, unless the case is reopened because of a violation of the settlement agreement.

        (2) Any other means authorized by law, including but not limited to:

        (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or the regulations in this part.

        (ii) Use of any requirement of, or referral to, any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.

        (b) NEH will limit any termination under § 1172.36(a)(1) to the particular recipient and particular program or activity, or portion thereof, that NEH finds in violation of the Act or the regulations in this part. NEH will not base its decision to terminate on any findings with respect to any other program or activity of the recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from NEH.

        (c) NEH will not take action under § 1172.36(a) until:

        (1) The Chairman has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or the regulations in this part, and that NEH has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, and

        (2) Thirty (30) days have elapsed after the Chairman has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the Congressional Committee(s) having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Chairman will file such report whenever it takes action under § 1172.36(a).

        (d) NEH also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when a hearing under § 1172.36(a)(1) is initiated.

        (1) New Federal financial assistance includes all assistance for which NEH requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a termination hearing under § 1172.36(a)(1), or increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards.

        (2) NEH will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 1172.36(a)(1). NEH will not continue a deferral for more than sixty (60) days unless a hearing has begun within that time, or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual written consent of the recipient and NEH. NEH will not continue a deferral for more than thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.

        (3) NEH will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity, or portion thereof, that NEH finds in violation of the Act or the regulations in this part. NEH will not base the deferral decision any finding with respect to any other program or activity of the recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from NEH.

        § 1172.37   Hearings, decisions, post-termination proceedings.

#### § § 1172.37

        Certain NEH procedural provisions applicable to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to NEH enforcement of the regulations in this part. They are found at 45 CFR chapter XI, subchapter A, 1110.9 through 1110.11.

        § 1172.38   Remedial action by recipients.

#### § § 1172.38

        Where NEH finds a recipient has discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action that NEH may require to overcome the effects of discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, NEH may require both recipients to take remedial action.

        § 1172.39   Alternate funds disbursal procedure.

#### § § 1172.39

        When NEH withholds funds from a recipient under the regulations in this part, the Chairman may disburse the withheld funds directly to an alternate recipient otherwise eligible for NEH support. NEH will require any alternate recipient to demonstrate the ability to comply with the regulations in this part and to achieve the goals of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89-209 (20 U.S.C. 951)—the Federal statute authorizing the Federal financial assistance.

        § 1172.40   Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

#### § § 1172.40

        (a) A complainant may file a civil action under the Act and the regulations in this part following the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Administrative remedies are exhausted if one hundred eighty (180) days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and NEH has made no finding with regard to the complaint, or NEH issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

        (b) If either of the conditions set forth in § 1172.40(a) is satisfied, NEH will:

        (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact,

        (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right, to bring a civil action for injunctive relief, and

        (3) Inform the complainant:

        (i) That a civil action can only be brought in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business,

        (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint,

        (iii) That before commencing the action, the complainant must give thirty (30) days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, the Chairman, and the recipient,

        (iv) That the notice must state the alleged violation of the Act, the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the action, and, whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails, and

        (v) That no action may be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

#### § § 1173.1

      (a) This part explains when the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) will indemnify you, an employee or a former employee of NEH, against a verdict, judgment, or other monetary award that a court or other competent authority renders against you. When NEH indemnifies you against a verdict, judgment, or other monetary award, it means that NEH will pay the amounts that the court orders you to pay.

      (b) This part also explains when NEH will settle a claim (also referred to as compromising a claim) that someone brings or threatens to bring against you in court or before another competent authority. It is only in exceptional circumstances that NEH will agree to settle a claim before a court or other competent authority has entered a verdict, judgment, or monetary award against you.

      (c) In order for NEH to indemnify you or settle a claim:

      (1) The verdict, judgment, or monetary award to be paid or the claim to be settled must relate to something that you did (or failed to do) within the scope of your employment with NEH; and

      (2) The Chairperson of NEH or someone the Chairperson designates (the Agency Official) must determine, as a matter of discretion, that indemnifying you or settling the claim would be in the interest of NEH.

      (d) If you become aware that someone has made or may make a claim against you personally as a result of something that you did (or failed to do) within the scope of your employment, you must immediately notify the Office of the General Counsel.

      (e) To request that NEH indemnify you or settle a claim against you, you must submit a written request to the Office of the General Counsel. You must include a copy of the verdict, judgment, monetary award, or settlement proposal, as appropriate. The Office of the General Counsel may consult about the matter with your supervisor, other agency employees, and the Department of Justice.

      (f) The Agency Official may waive the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if it would be in the interest of NEH to do so.

      (g) If the Agency Official determines that NEH will indemnify you or settle a claim on your behalf, NEH's commitment will be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. The Agency Official may impose other conditions or limitations on the determination at his or her discretion.

      (h) If the Chairperson requests indemnification or settlement of a claim, the General Counsel will perform the functions assigned to the Chairperson under this section with respect to that request.

        (a) A defendant may file an answer with the reviewing official within thirty days of service of the complaint. An answer will be considered a request for an oral hearing.

        (b) In the answer, the defendant—

        (1) Must admit or deny each allegation of liability contained in the complaint (a failure to deny an allegation is considered an admission);

        (2) Must state any defense on which the defendant intends to rely;

        (3) May state any reasons why the penalties, assessments, or both should be less than the statutory maximum; and

        (4) Must state the name, address, and telephone number of the person the defendant authorized to act as the defendant's representative, if any.

        (c) If the defendant is unable to file a timely answer which meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the defendant may file with the reviewing official a general answer denying liability, requesting a hearing, and requesting an extension of time in which to file a complete answer. The defendant must file a general answer within thirty days of service of the complaint.

        (d) If the defendant initially files a general answer requesting an extension of time, the reviewing official must promptly file with the ALJ the complaint, the general answer, and the request for an extension of time.

        (e) For good cause shown, the ALJ may grant the defendant up to thirty additional days within which to file an answer that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The defendant must file such an answer with the ALJ and must serve a copy on the reviewing official.

        § 1174.10   Default upon failure to file an answer.

#### § § 1174.10

        (a) If the defendant does not file any answer within thirty days after service of the complaint, the reviewing official may refer the complaint to the ALJ.

        (b) Once the reviewing official refers the complaint, the ALJ will promptly serve on the defendant a notice that the ALJ will issue an initial decision.

        (c) The ALJ will assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and, if such facts establish liability under the statute, the ALJ will issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of penalties and assessments allowed under the PFCRA.

        (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when a defendant fails to file a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the penalties and assessments the ALJ may impose in the initial decision.

        (e) The initial decision becomes final thirty days after the ALJ issues it.

        (f) At any time before an initial decision becomes final, a defendant may file a motion with the ALJ asking that the ALJ reopen the case. An ALJ may only reopen a case if he or she determines that the defendant set forth in the motion extraordinary circumstances that prevented the defendant from filing a timely answer. The initial decision will be stayed until the ALJ decides on the motion. The reviewing official may respond to the motion.

        (g) If the ALJ determines that a defendant has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances that excuse his or her failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will withdraw the initial decision and grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.

        (h) The ALJ's decision to deny a defendant's motion to reopen a case is not subject to reconsideration under § 1174.35.

        (i) The defendant may appeal the ALJ's decision denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head within fifteen days after the ALJ denies the motion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal shall stay the initial decision until the authority head decides the issue.

        (j) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the authority head, the ALJ shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head.

        (k) The authority head shall decide expeditiously, based solely on the record before the ALJ, whether extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer.

        (l) If the authority head decides that extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.

        (m) If the authority head decides that the circumstances do not excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall reinstate the ALJ's initial decision, which shall become final and binding upon the parties thirty days after the authority head issues such a decision.

        § 1174.11   Referral of complaint and answer to the ALJ.

#### § § 1174.11

        When the reviewing official receives an answer, he or she must simultaneously file the complaint, the answer, and a designation of the authority's representative with the ALJ.

#### § § 1174.34

        In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose.

#### § § 1174.35

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

      (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.

The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

#### § § 1176.1

      (a)  Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced workweek, providing parents with opportunities to balance family responsibilities with the need for added income, and assisting students who must finance their own education or vocational training. In view of this, the National Endowment for the Humanities will operate a part-time career employment program, consistent with its responsibilities and in accordance with Public Law 95-437, the Federal Employees' Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978.

      (b)  The Personnel Officer is responsible for program operation and coordination.

      (a)  means employment of 16 to 32 hours a week under a schedule consisting of an equal or varied number of hours per day, whether in a position which would be part-time without regard to the Act or one established to allow job-sharing or comparable arrangements, but does not include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

      (b)  includes competitive and excepted service employees in tenure groups I and II.

      § 1176.3   Criteria.

#### § § 1176.3

      Positions becoming vacant, unless excepted as provided by § 1176.8, will be reviewed to determine the feasibility of converting them to part-time. Among the criteria which may be used when conducting this review are:

      (a) Mission requirements.

      (b) Workload.

      (c) Employment ceilings and budgetary considerations.

      (d) Availability of qualified applicants willing to work part-time.

      § 1176.4   Establishing and converting part-time positions.

#### § § 1176.4

      Position management and other internal reviews may indicate that positions may be either converted from full-time or initially established as part-time positions. Criteria listed in § 1176.3 may be used during these reviews. If a decision is made to convert to or to establish a part-time position, regular position management and classification procedures will be followed.

      § 1176.5   Annual plan.

#### § § 1176.5

      (a) An agencywide plan for promoting part-time employment opportunities will be developed annually. This plan will establish annual goals and set interim and final deadlines for achieving these goals. This plan will be applicable throughout the agency, and will be transmitted to the Office of Personnel Management with the required report to OPM on the status of the program as of September 30 of each year.

      (b) Beginning in FY 1981 in administering personnel ceilings, part-time career employees shall be counted against ceiling authorizations as a fraction. This will be determined by dividing 40 hours into the average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek.

      § 1176.6   Review and evaluation.

#### § § 1176.6

      Regular employment reports will be used to determine levels of part-time employment. This program will also be designated an item of special interest to be reviewed during personnel management reviews.

      § 1176.7   Publicizing vacancies.

#### § § 1176.7

      When applicants from outside the Federal service are desired, part-time vacanies may be publicized through various recruiting means, such as:

      (a) Federal Job Information Centers.

      (b) State Employment Offices.

      (c) Veterans' Administration Recruiting Bulletins.

      § 1176.8   Exceptions.

#### § § 1176.8

      (a) The Personnel Officer may except positions from inclusion in this program to provide fewer than 16 hours per week. This will normally be done in furtherance of special hiring programs such as the Stay-in-School or Handicapped Employment Program.

      (b) On occasions when it becomes necessary to allow supervisors and managers to temporarily increase the hours of duty of employees above 32 hours per week for limited and specific periods of time to meet heavy workloads, perform special assignments, permit employee training, etc., the Endowment policy is as follows:

      (1) Requests to work NEH employees on a 32 hour/week appointment more than 32 hours must be submitted in advance to the Personnel Office;

      (2) Justification should be concise but specific and must state the exact time frame for the increase in hours above 32 hours per week; and

      (3) The Program Coordinator will decide if the request meets the intent of the law and this agency's policy.

    PART 1177—CLAIMS COLLECTION

### Part 1177

**Authority:** Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716-3719; Pub. L. 104-134; 31 CFR 900-904.

**Source:** Source: 86 FR 66965, Nov. 24, 2021, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Scope of Standards

        § 1177.1   Prescription of standards.

#### § § 1177.1

        (a) The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is issuing the regulation the regulations in this part pursuant to 31 CFR 900-904 and under the authority contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(d)(2). The regulations in this part prescribe the standards that NEH will use in the administrative collection, offset, compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity for civil claims for money, funds, or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C. 3701(b), unless specific Federal agency statues or regulations apply to such activities or, as provided for by Title 11 of the United States Code, when the claims involve bankruptcy. Federal agencies include agencies of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Government, including Government corporations. The regulations in this part also prescribe standards for referring debts to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office of Management and Budget's circular A-129 (Revised), “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,” the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) “Managing Federal Receivables,” and other publications concerning debt collection and debt management. These publications are available from the Debt Management Services, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, 401 14th Street SW, Room 151, Washington, DC 20227.

        (b) Additional rules governing centralized administrative offset and the transfer of delinquent debts to Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers for collection (cross-servicing) under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, 1358 (April 26, 1996) (DCIA), are issued in separate regulations by Treasury. Rules governing the use of certain debt collection tools created under the DCIA, such as administrative wage garnishment, also are issued in separate regulations by Treasury. See generally 31 CFR 285.

        (c) NEH is not limited to the remedies contained in this part and may use all authorized remedies, including alternative dispute resolution and arbitration, to collect civil claims, to the extent that such remedies are not inconsistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, Public Law 89-508, 80 Stat. 308 (July 19, 1966), the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 (October 25, 1982), the DCIA, or other relevant statutes. The regulations in this part are not intended to impair NEH's common law rights to collect debts.

        (d) Standards and policies regarding the classification of debt for accounting purposes (for example, write off of uncollectible debt) are contained in the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-129 (Revised), “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.”

        § 1177.2   Definitions and construction.

#### § § 1177.2

        (a) For the purposes of the standards in this part, the terms “claim” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that an agency official has determined to be due the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms “claim” and “debt” include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

        (b) “Chairperson” means the Chairperson of NEH or the Chairperson's designee.

        (c) A debt is “delinquent” if it has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement), unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.

        (d) Words in the plural form shall include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude matters not listed but do include matters that are in the same general class.

        (e) “Recoupment” is a special method for adjusting debts arising under the same transaction or occurrence. For example, obligations arising under the same contract generally are subject to recoupment.

        (f) Unless otherwise stated, “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.

        § 1177.3   Antitrust, fraud, and tax and interagency claims excluded.

#### § § 1177.3

        (a) The standards in this part relating to compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity do not apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct that violates the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim. Only DOJ has the authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection activity on such claims. The standards in this part relating to the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent authorized by DOJ in a particular case. Upon identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, NEH shall promptly refer the case to DOJ for action. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to NEH for further handling, in accordance with the standards in this part.

        (b) This part does not apply to tax debts.

        (c) This part does not apply to claims between Federal agencies. NEH will attempt to resolve interagency claims by negotiation in accordance with Executive Order 12146 (3 CFR, 1979 Comp., pp. 409-412).

        § 1177.4   Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other statutes not precluded.

#### § § 1177.4

        Nothing in this part precludes NEH's disposition of any claim under statutes and implementing regulations other than 31 U.S.C. 37, subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government). See  the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, Public Law 87-693, 76 Stat. 593 (September 25, 1962) (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2651 ), and applicable regulations, 28 CFR 43. In such cases, the laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to NEH's claims collection activities generally take precedence over this part.

        § 1177.5   Form of payment.

#### § § 1177.5

        Debtors may pay claims in the form of money or, when a contractual basis exists, the Government may demand the return of specific property or the performance of specific services.

        § 1177.6   Subdivision of claims not authorized.

#### § § 1177.6

        NEH will not subdivide debts in order to avoid the monetary ceiling established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2). NEH will consider a debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract as a single debt in determining whether the debt is one of less than $100,000 (excluding interest, penalties, and administrative costs) or such higher amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of compromising, suspending, or terminating collection activity.

        § 1177.7   Required administrative proceedings.

#### § § 1177.7

        NEH is not required to omit, foreclose, or duplicate administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

        § 1177.8   No private rights created.

#### § § 1177.8

        The standards in this part do not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person, nor shall NEH's failure to comply with any of the provisions of this part be available to any debtor as a defense.

      Subpart B—Standards for the Administrative Collection of Claims

        § 1177.9   Aggressive NEH collection activity.

#### § § 1177.9

        (a) NEH will aggressively collect all debts that arise out of its activities, or that are referred or transferred for collection services to NEH. NEH will promptly undertake collection activities and take follow-up action as necessary. Nothing in 31 CFR 900 through 904 requires DOJ, Treasury, or other Treasury-designated debt collection centers to duplicate collection activities previously undertaken by NEH or to perform collection activities that NEH should have undertaken.

        (b) Debts that NEH refers or transfers to Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) will be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.

        (c) NEH will cooperate with other agencies in debt collection activities.

        (d) NEH will consider referring debts that are less than 180 days delinquent to Treasury or to Treasury-designated debt collection centers to accomplish efficient, cost effective debt collection. Treasury is a debt collection center, is authorized to designate other Federal agencies as debt collection centers based on their performance in collecting delinquent debts, and may withdraw such designations. Referrals to debt collection centers are at the discretion of, and for a time period acceptable to, the Secretary. Referrals may be for servicing, collection, compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action.

        (e) NEH will transfer to the Secretary any debt that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so that the Secretary may take appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection action. See 31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of Debts to Treasury for Collection). This requirement does not apply to any debt that:

        (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

        (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;

        (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary;

        (4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary (see paragraph (d) of this section);

        (5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent; or

        (6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interests of the United States. NEH may request that the Secretary exempt specific classes of debts.

        (f) Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. NEH may pay the fee out of amounts it collects and may add the fee to the debt as an administrative cost (see § 1177.18).

> [86 FR 66965, Nov. 24, 2021; 86 FR 69586, Dec. 8, 2021]

        § 1177.10   Demand for payment.

#### § § 1177.10

        (a) NEH will promptly make a written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, upon a debtor of the United States in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with NEH to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters will depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to NEH's letters or telephone calls. Generally, one demand letter should suffice. In determining the timing of the demand letter(s), NEH will give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to DOJ for litigation, in accordance with § 1177.33 or otherwise. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent a statute of limitations from running), NEH may precede written demand by other appropriate actions under this part, including immediate referral for litigation.

        (b) Demand letters will inform the debtor of:

        (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the rights, if any, the debtor may have to seek review within NEH;

        (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, or administrative costs;

        (3) The date by which the debtor should make payment in order to avoid late charges ( interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced collection, which generally should not be more than thirty (30) days from the date that NEH mails or hand-delivers the demand letter; and

        (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within NEH.

        (c) NEH will exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are dated. There is no prescribed format for demand letters. NEH will utilize demand letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable determination of whether the agency can resolve the debt administratively or must refer it for litigation.

        (d) NEH will include in demand letters such items as the agency's willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment; its policies with respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and collection agencies; its remedies to enforce payment of the debt (including assessment of interest, administrative costs and penalties, administrative garnishment, the use of collection agencies, Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 days be transferred to Treasury for collection; and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver.

        (e) NEH will respond promptly to communications from debtors, within thirty (30) days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.

        (f) Prior to initiating the demand process, or at any time during or after completing the demand process, if NEH determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, it will follow the offset procedures in § 1177.11. The availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset, and NEH's determination to pursue collection by offset, will release NEH from further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

        (g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, NEH will advise each person it determines to be liable for the debt that, unless the agency can collect the debt administratively, it may initiate litigation. This notification will comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., pp. 157-163) and may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this section or in a separate document. NEH will notify DOJ that it has given this notice.

        (h) When NEH learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, the agency will immediately seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless NEH determines that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases NEH will immediately stop collection activity against the debtor.

        (1) After seeking legal advice, in most cases NEH will file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. NEH will refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.

        (2) If NEH is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.

        (3) In most cases, offset is stayed by the automatic stay. However, NEH will seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel to determine whether it may freeze its payments to the debtor, and other agencies' payments that are available for offset, until it can obtain from the bankruptcy court relief from the automatic stay. NEH will also seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel to determine whether recoupment is available.

        § 1177.11   Collection by administrative offset.

#### § § 1177.11

        (a)  (1) The term “administrative offset” has the meaning provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).

        (2) This section does not apply to:

        (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404;

        (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);

        (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of the United States;

        (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);

        (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment that a debtor obtained against the United States;

        (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular types of debts; or

        (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.

        (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, NEH may collect debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

        (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, NEH will not collect a debt by administrative offset under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 more than ten (10) years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the Government official or officials who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.

        (5) In bankruptcy cases, NEH will seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.

        (b)  (1) NEH is required to refer past due, legally enforceable nontax debts which are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection by centralized administrative offset. NEH may also refer debts which are less than 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for this purpose. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for debt certification requirements.

        (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who owe debts which NEH referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and United States disbursing officials designated by the Secretary. When a debtor's name and TIN match a payee's name and TIN and all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt.

        (3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice will include a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within the creditor agency who will respond to questions regarding the offset.

        (4) NEH will initiate offsets only after:

        (i) Sending the debtor written notice of the type and amount of the debt, NEH's intention to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; and

        (ii) Giving the debtor the opportunity:

        (A) To inspect and copy NEH records related to the debt;

        (B) For a review within NEH of its determination of indebtedness; and

        (C) To make a written agreement to repay the debt.

        (5) NEH may omit the procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section when:

        (i) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;

        (ii) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in  v.  995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

        (iii) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, NEH first learns of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When NEH omits prior notice and an opportunity for review, it will give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable, and it will promptly refund any money which it ultimately finds the debtor did not owe to the Government.

        (6) When an agency has previously given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see  § 1177.10), NEH need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before initiating administrative offset.

        (7) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, NEH will certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that:

        (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

        (ii) NEH has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.

        (8) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary will exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency requests in writing that the Secretary do so. Also, the Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency's written request.

        (9) NEH may offset benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, ), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921, ), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than tier two (2) benefits), only in accordance with Treasury regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.

        (10) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988's provisions concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from NEH, as the creditor agency, that it has met the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a). NEH's certification in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section will satisfy this requirement. If the Secretary grants such a waiver, only Treasury's Data Integrity Board is required to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

        (c)  (1) Generally, NEH will conduct non-centralized administrative offsets at its discretion on an ad hoc case-by-case basis, internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, NEH may collect past due, legally enforceable non-tax delinquent debts through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor agency may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor in order to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for a creditor agency to request that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service in order to satisfy an unpaid advance.

        (2) Before requesting that a payment authorizing agency conduct a non-centralized administrative offset, NEH will provide:

        (i) The debtor with due process as set forth in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section; and

        (ii) The payment authorizing agency with written certification that the debtor owes past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that NEH has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.

        (3) Payment authorizing agencies will comply with offset requests by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the authorizing agency's program, or would otherwise be contrary to law. NEH will make appropriate use of other agencies' cooperative efforts in effecting collection by administrative offset.

        (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, NEH will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the specific case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.

        (d)  Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, NEH may request that OPM offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that NEH initiate offset prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (e)  (1) For purposes of this section, whenever NEH is required to afford a debtor a review, it will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and NEH determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

        (2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although NEH will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

        (3) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which a determination of indebtedness rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and NEH has determined that the review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes.

        (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, NEH will accord the debtor a “paper hearing;” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

        § 1177.12   Reporting debts.

#### § § 1177.12

        (a) NEH procedures for reporting delinquent debts to credit bureaus and other automated databases will comply with the Bankruptcy Code and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The provisions of the Privacy Act do not apply to credit bureaus.

        (b) NEH procedures for reporting delinquent consumer debts to credit bureaus will be consistent with the due process and other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(e). When an agency has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt, NEH need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before reporting that delinquent consumer debt to credit bureaus.

        (c) NEH will report delinquent debts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS). NEH will contact the Director of Information Resources Management Policy and Management Division, Office of Information Technology, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street SW, Washington, DC 20410 for information about the CAIVRS program.

        § 1177.13   Contracting with private collection contractors and with entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

#### § § 1177.13

        (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, NEH may contract with private collection contractors, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover delinquent debts, provided that:

        (1) NEH retains the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for litigation;

        (2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt less the private collection contractor's fee unless NEH has granted such authority prior to the offer;

        (3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and

        (4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all amounts collected.

        (b) NEH will use government-wide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private contractors. However, NEH may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant to a contract with the private collection contractor only if such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to Treasury for collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 285.12(e).

        (c) NEH may fund private collection contractor contracts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), or as otherwise permitted by law.

        (d) NEH may enter into contracts for locating and recovering United States assets, such as unclaimed assets. NEH will establish procedures that are acceptable to the Secretary before entering into contracts to recover United States assets held by a state government or a financial institution.

        (e) NEH may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges NEH for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

        § 1177.14   Suspension or revocation of eligibility for federal financial assistance.

#### § § 1177.14

        (a) Unless waived by the Chairperson (or the Chairperson's designee), NEH will not extend financial assistance, which includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, loans, loan guarantees, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a nontax debt owed to a Federal agency. NEH may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary may exempt classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards defining when a “delinquency” is “resolved” for purposes of this prohibition. See 31 CFR 285.13 (Barring Delinquent Debtors from Obtaining Federal Loans or Loan Insurance or Guarantees).

        (b) In non-bankruptcy cases, when NEH is seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims, it will consider suspending or revoking a debtor's licenses, permits, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other privileges for inexcusable or willful failure to pay such a debt in accordance with NEH's regulations or governing procedures. In its written demand for payment, NEH will advise the debtor of the agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other privileges. In instances where NEH is making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or loans, it will consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, grantee, partner, counterparty, broker, or participant from doing further business with NEH or engaging in programs, agreements, or activities that are sponsored, co-sponsored or otherwise supported by NEH if such lender, contractor, grantee, partner, counterparty, broker, or participant fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, grantee, partner, counterparty, broker, or participant has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program, agreement, or activity by another Federal agency. NEH will report to Treasury the failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305. The Treasury will forward to all interested agencies a notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Government has been revoked by Treasury.

        (c) NEH will also extend the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other privileges to Federal programs, agreements, or activities that are administered by the states or other third parties on behalf of the Federal Government, to the extent that they affect the Federal Government's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors. Therefore, states or other third parties that manage Federal programs, agreements, or activities, pursuant to NEH approval, should ensure that appropriate steps are taken to safeguard against issuing licenses, permits, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other privileges to debtors who fail to pay their debts to the Federal Government.

        (d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of its intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other privileges, NEH will seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.

        § 1177.15   Liquidation of collateral.

#### § § 1177.15

        (a) NEH will liquidate security or collateral through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.

        (b) When NEH learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the agency will seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including but not limited to 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 1177.16   Collection in installments.

#### § § 1177.16

        (a) Whenever feasible, NEH will collect the total amount of a debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, NEH may accept payment in regular installments. NEH will obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible (see § 1177.22(g) of this part). If NEH agrees to accept payments in regular installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and that contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default.

        (b) The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.

        (c) NEH will obtain security for deferred payments, in appropriate cases. NEH may accept installment payments notwithstanding the debtor's refusal to execute a written agreement or to give security, at the agency's option.

        § 1177.17   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

#### § § 1177.17

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, NEH will charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. NEH will mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to NEH, explaining the agency's requirements concerning these charges, except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.

        (b) NEH will charge interest on debts owed the United States as follows:

        (1) Interest will accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law.

        (2) Unless otherwise established in a grant, cooperate agreement, contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest that NEH charges will be the rate that the Secretary establishes annually in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, NEH may charge a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. NEH will document the reason(s) for its determination that the higher rate is necessary.

        (3) The rate of interest that NEH initially charges will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, NEH may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Treasury's value of funds at the time the new agreement is executed. NEH will not compound interest; that is, it will not charge interest on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, NEH will add to the principal under the new repayment agreement any charges that accrued but which NEH did not collect under the defaulted agreement.

        (c) NEH will assess administrative costs it incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. NEH will base its calculation of administrative costs on the actual costs it incurred or upon its estimated costs.

        (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, NEH will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), not to exceed six (6) percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than ninety (90) days. This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency.

        (e) NEH may increase an “administrative debt” by the cost-of-living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. “Administrative debt” includes but is not limited to a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guaranties. The cost-of-living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. NEH will annually compute increases to administrative debts. NEH will use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the debt's age.

        (f) When a debtor pays a debt in partial or installment payments, the Government will first apply the amount it receives to any contingency fees added to the debt, second to outstanding penalties, third to administrative costs other than contingency fees, fourth to interest, and last to principal. For purposes of this paragraph (f), “contingency fees” are administrative costs resulting from fees paid by a Federal agency to other Federal agencies or private collection contractors for collection services rendered when the fees are paid from the amounts collected from a debtor.

        (g) NEH will waive the collection of interest and administrative costs imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that the debtor pays within thirty (30) days after the date on which interest began to accrue. NEH may extend this thirty-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, NEH may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if NEH determines that collection of these charges is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States.

        (h) NEH will not suspend the assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs during the administrative review of a debt, except for periods during which it has suspended collection activity under § 1177.29 of this part.

        (i) NEH is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law.

        § 1177.18   Analysis of costs.

#### § § 1177.18

        NEH will periodically compare costs incurred and amounts collected. NEH will use data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, assist in evaluating compromise offers, and establish minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.

        § 1177.19   Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

#### § § 1177.19

        (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt under this part or other authority, NEH may send a request to the Secretary to obtain a debtor's mailing address from the Internal Revenue Service's records.

        (b) NEH is authorized to use mailing addresses it obtained under paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.

        § 1177.20   Exemptions.

#### § § 1177.20

        (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent that they reflect remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the DCIA, such as administrative offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1, ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, ), except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716©; or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the DCIA, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.

        (b) NEH does not construe this section as prohibiting its use of these authorities or requirements when collecting debts owed by persons employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the debt arose under those laws.

      Subpart C—Standards for the Compromise of Claims

        § 1177.21   Scope and application.

#### § § 1177.21

        (a) The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. NEH may exercise such compromise authority for debts that arise out of its activities, or that are referred or transferred to it for collection services, when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General. The Chairperson may designate officials within NEH to exercise the authorities in this section.

        (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with DOJ. NEH will evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in this subpart. If NEH finds that an offer to compromise a debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable, it will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in DOJ using a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). NEH may obtain the CCLR from DOJ's National Central Intake Facility. The referral will include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. DOJ approval is not required if NEH rejects a compromise offer.

        § 1177.22   Bases for compromise.

#### § § 1177.22

        (a) NEH may compromise a debt if the Government cannot collect the full amount because:

        (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information;

        (2) The Government is unable to collect the debt in full by enforced collection proceedings within a reasonable time;

        (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount; or

        (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court.

        (b) NEH will consider the following relevant factors when determining the debtor's inability to pay:

        (1) The debtor's age and health;

        (2) The debtor's present and potential income;

        (3) The debtor's inheritance prospects;

        (4) The possibility that the debtor has concealed or improperly transferred assets; and

        (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.

        (c) NEH will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using a credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. NEH will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. NEH also may consider uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. A compromise that NEH effects under this section will be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.

        (d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, then the amount that NEH accepts in compromise of such cases should fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the litigative risks involved, NEH will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.

        (e) NEH may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount NEH accepts in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, NEH will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.

        (f) NEH generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, NEH will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the debtor's full original principal balance prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, will be reinstated. Whenever possible, NEH also will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in subpart B of this part.

        (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a reasonable time, NEH will obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. NEH also may obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise offers. NEH may use its own financial information form or may request suitable forms from DOJ or the local United States Attorney's Office.

        § 1177.23   Enforcement policy.

#### § § 1177.23

        Pursuant to this subpart, NEH may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims that it established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if NEH's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, present and future, will be adequately served by the agency's acceptance of the compromise offer.

        § 1177.24   Joint and several liability.

#### § § 1177.24

        (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, NEH will pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. NEH will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

        (b) NEH will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

> [86 FR 66965, Nov. 24, 2021; 86 FR 69586, Dec. 8, 2021]

        § 1177.25   Further review of compromise offers.

#### § § 1177.25

        If NEH is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, substantive compromise offer on a debt that is within the agency's delegated compromise authority, it may refer the offer to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in DOJ, using a CCLR accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the debt. DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to NEH with instructions or advice.

        § 1177.26   Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

#### § § 1177.26

        In negotiating a compromise, NEH will consider the tax consequences to the Government. In particular, NEH will consider requiring a waiver of the debtor's tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights. For information on discharge of indebtedness reporting requirements, see § 1177.32.

        § 1177.27   Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

#### § § 1177.27

        In all appropriate instances, NEH will implement acceptable compromises by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and all of the debtor's claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction. In the event NEH does not execute a mutual release when it compromises a debt, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction that gave rise to the compromised debt.

      Subpart D—Standards for Suspending or Terminating Collection Activity

        § 1177.28   Scope and application.

#### § § 1177.28

        (a) The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711, on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to DOJ for litigation, NEH may suspend or terminate collection under this subpart with respect to debts that arise out of its activities, or that are referred or transferred to it for collection services.

        (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with DOJ. If NEH believes that suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, it will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in DOJ, using the CCLR. The referral will specify the reasons for NEH's recommendation. If, prior to referral to the DOJ, NEH determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, NEH may terminate collection activity without obtaining DOJ concurrence, regardless of the amount involved.

        § 1177.29   Suspension of collection activity.

#### § § 1177.29

        (a) NEH may suspend collection activity on a debt when:

        (1) NEH cannot locate the debtor;

        (2) NEH expects the debtor's financial condition to improve; or

        (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

        (b) NEH may suspend collection activity on a debt when, based on the debtor's current financial condition, the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection activity and:

        (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

        (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the ten-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or

        (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the debt with interest at a later date.

        (c)(1) NEH will suspend collection activity during the time required to consider the debtor's request for waiver or administrative review of the debt, if the statute under which the debtor makes the request prohibits NEH from collecting the debt during that time.

        (2) If the statute under which the debtor makes the request does not prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the debtor's request, NEH may use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. Further, NEH ordinarily will suspend collection action upon a request for waiver or review if a statute or regulation prohibits NEH from issuing a refund of amounts it collected prior to considering the debtor's request. However, NEH should not suspend collection when it determines that the request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.

        (d) If NEH learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, in most cases it must suspend the collection activity on that debtor's debt, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, unless NEH can clearly establish that the automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. NEH will immediately seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel and, if legally permitted, take the necessary legal steps to ensure that the agency does not pay any funds or money to the debtor until it obtains relief from the automatic stay.

        § 1177.30   Termination of collection activity.

#### § § 1177.30

        (a) NEH may terminate collection activity when:

        (1) NEH is unable to collect any substantial amount through its own efforts or through the efforts of others;

        (2) NEH is unable to locate the debtor;

        (3) NEH anticipates that the costs of collection will exceed the amount recoverable;

        (4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

        (5) NEH cannot substantiate the debt; or

        (6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

        (b) Before terminating collection activity, NEH will have pursued all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Terminating collection activity ceases active collection of the debt but does not preclude NEH from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

        (1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary determines that such sale is in the best interests of the United States;

        (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

        (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time the agency terminated collection activity; or

        (4) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.

        (c) Generally, NEH will terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. NEH may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, if NEH is a known creditor of the debtor, its claims may survive a discharge if it did not receive formal notice of the proceedings. NEH will seek legal advice from its Office of the General Counsel if it believes it has claims or offsets that may survive the discharge of a debtor.

        § 1177.31   Exception to termination.

#### § § 1177.31

        When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, NEH may refer debts for litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.

        § 1177.32   Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

#### § § 1177.32

        (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a close out of the debt), NEH will take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as applicable, administrative offset; tax refund offset; Federal salary offset; referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection centers, or private collection contractors; credit bureau reporting; wage garnishment; litigation; and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity under this subpart and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When NEH suspends or terminates collection action on a debt, the debt remains delinquent and NEH may pursue further collection action at a later date, in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When NEH discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited. Therefore, NEH will make the determination that collection action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. NEH must also terminate debt collection action before discharging a debt.

        (b) Section 3711(i), title 31, United States Code, requires NEH to sell a delinquent nontax debt upon termination of collection action if the Secretary determines such a sale is in the best interests of the United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), NEH may not discharge a debt until it meets the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i).

        (c) Upon discharge of an indebtedness, NEH must report the discharge to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. NEH may request Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a discharge report to the IRS on NEH's behalf.

        (d) When discharging a debt, NEH must request that litigation counsel release any liens of record securing the debt.

      Subpart E—Referrals to the Department of Justice

        § 1177.33   Prompt referral.

#### § § 1177.33

        (a) NEH will promptly refer to DOJ for litigation any debts on which it has taken aggressive collection activity in accordance with subpart B of this part and that it cannot compromise, or on which it cannot suspend or terminate collection activity, in accordance with subparts C and D of this part. NEH may refer those debts arising out of its activities, or that were referred or transferred to it for collection services. NEH will refer debts for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General my direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at DOJ, Washington, DC. NEH will refer debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000 or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the CCLR instructions. NEH will refer debts as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection activity and the standards contained in this part, and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors. NEH will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within one year of the date that such debts last became delinquent.

        (b) DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts NEH refers to it, pursuant to this section. As the referring agency, NEH will immediately terminate its administrative debt collection activities at the time it refers the debt to the DOJ. NEH will advise DOJ of the collection activities it has utilized to date, and their result. NEH will refrain from having any contact with the debtor and shall direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to DOJ. NEH will immediately notify DOJ of any payments it credited to the debtor's account after it referred a debt under this section. DOJ will notify NEH, in a timely manner, of any payments it receives from the debtor.

        § 1177.34   Claims Collection Litigation Report.

#### § § 1177.34

        (a) Unless excepted by DOJ, NEH will complete the CCLR (see § 1177.21(b)), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to DOJ for litigation. As a referring agency, NEH will complete all sections of the CCLR that are appropriate to each claim, as required by the CCLR instructions, and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.

        (b) NEH will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions it wishes DOJ to take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits NEH to indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which DOJ may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and efficiency judgment.

        (c) NEH also will use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or terminate NEH collection activity.

        § 1177.35   Preservation of evidence.

#### § § 1177.35

        When NEH refers claims to DOJ, it will take care to preserve all files and records that DOJ may need to prove its claims in court. NEH ordinarily will include certified copies of the documents that form the basis for its claims in the packages it creates to refer its claims to DOJ for litigation. NEH will provide originals of such documents immediately upon DOJ's request.

        § 1177.36   Minimum amount of referrals to the Department of Justice.

#### § § 1177.36

        (a) NEH will not refer to DOJ for litigation any claims of less than $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe. DOJ will promptly notify NEH if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.

        (b) NEH will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless:

        (1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with NEH's policies or programs;

        (2) NEH is referring the claim solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to NEH for enforcement; or

        (3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government can effectively enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.

        (c) NEH will consult with the Executive Office for United States Attorneys' Financial Litigation Staff at the DOJ prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum amount.

#### § § 1181.150

      (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

      (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

      (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1181.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

      (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

      (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

      (c) The Institute will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction of a record within 10 business days of its receipt, unless the request can be processed and the individual informed of the General Counsel's decision on the request within that 10-day period.

      (d) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete, based on a preponderance of the evidence, then the record will be corrected or amended promptly. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Institute function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, you will be informed in writing of the amendment, correction, or deletion. In addition, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.

      (e) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel does not agree that the record should be amended or corrected, you will be informed promptly in writing of the refusal to amend or correct the record and the reason for this decision.

#### § § 1182.11

      (a) You may appeal a refusal to amend or correct a record to the Director. Such appeal must be made in writing within 10 business days of your receipt of the initial refusal to amend or correct your record. Your appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1182.3), should indicate that it is an appeal, and should include the basis for the appeal.

      (b) The Director will review your request to amend or correct the record, the General Counsel's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. No hearing will be held.

      (c) The Director shall render his or her decision on your appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by the Institute, unless the Director, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Director extend the appeal period, you will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.

      (d) If the Director determines that the record that is the subject of the appeal should be amended or corrected, the record will be so modified, and you will be informed in writing of the amendment or correction. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.

      (e) If your appeal is denied, you will be informed in writing of the following:

      (1) The denial and the reasons for the denial;

      (2) That you may submit to the Institute a concise statement setting forth the reasons for your disagreement as to the disputed record. Under the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, your statement will be disclosed whenever the disputed record is disclosed; and

In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of your statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the Institute deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the Director's reasons for denying our appeal also may be disclosed with the record. While you will have access to this statement of the Director's reasons for denying your appeal, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of your statement of disagreement, as well as any statement of the Director's reasons for denying your appeal.

      § 1182.12   Fees charged to locate, review, or copy records.

#### § § 1182.12

      (a) The Institute shall charge no fees for search time or for any other time expended by the Institute to review a record. However, the Institute may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record (e.g., computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to you without cost.

      (b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying (e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.

      (c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.

      (d) A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Institute's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.

      (e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the “Institute of Museum and Library Services.”

      § 1182.13   Policies and procedures for Institute disclosure of its records.

#### § § 1182.13

      (a) The Institute will not disclose any record that is contained in a system of records to any person or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by or with the prior written consent of the subject individual, unless disclosure of the record is:

      (1) To those officers or employees of the Institute who maintain the record and who have a need for the record in the performance of their official duties;

      (2) Required under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Records required to be made available by the Freedom of Information Act will be released in response to a request to the Institute formulated in accordance with the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities regulations published at 45 CFR part 1184;

      (3) For a routine use as published in the annual notice in the

      (4) To the Census Bureau for purpose of planning or carrying out a census; survey, or related activity pursuant to the provisions of Title 13 of the United States Code;

      (5) To a recipient who has provided the Institute with adequate advance written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;

      (6) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States government, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States, or his or her designee, to determine whether the record has such value;

      (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity, if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Institute for such records specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought. The Institute also may disclose such a record to a law enforcement agency on its own initiative in situations in which criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such disclosure has been established as a routine use, or in situations in which the misconduct is directly related to the purpose for which the record is maintained;

      (8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if, upon such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;

      (9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdictions, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress, or subcommittee of any such joint committee;

      (10) To the Comptroller General, or any of his or her authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of official duties of the General Accounting Office;

      (11) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e); or

      (12) Pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that any record is disclosed under such compulsory legal process, the Institute shall make reasonable efforts to notify the subject individual after the process becomes a matter of public record.

      (b) Before disseminating any record about any individual to any person other than an Institute employee, the Institute shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such records are, or at the time they were collected were, accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Institute purposes. This paragraph (b) does not apply to dissemination made pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      § 1182.14   Procedures for maintaining accounts of disclosures made by the Institute from its systems of records.

#### § § 1182.14

      (a) The Office of the General Counsel shall maintain a log containing the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to another agency. Such accounting also shall contain the name and address of the person or agency to whom each disclosure was made. This log need not include disclosures made to Institute employees in the course of their official duties, or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

      (b) The Institute shall retain the accounting of each disclosure for at least five years after the accounting is made or for the life of the record that was disclosed, whichever is longer.

      (c) The Institute shall make the accounting of disclosures of a record pertaining to you available to you at your request. Such a request should be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1182.8. This paragraph (c) does not apply to disclosures made for law enforcement purposes under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7) and § 1182.13(a)(7).

      § 1182.15   Institute responsibility for maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems.

#### § § 1182.15

      The Chief Information Officer has the responsibility of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained, including all reports and outputs from such systems that contain identifiable personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or destruction of any personal records or data, and must furthermore minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that skilled technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to such records or data.

      (a)  (1) Records contained in a system of records as defined in this part may be used, held, or stored only where facilities are adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or outside the Institute.

      (2) All records, when not under the personal control of the employees authorized to use the records, must be stored in a locked filing cabinet. Some systems of records are not of such confidential nature that their disclosure would constitute a harm to an individual who is the subject of such record. However, records in this category also shall be maintained in locked filing cabinets or maintained in a secured room with a locking door.

      (3) Access to and use of a system of records shall be permitted only to persons whose duties require such access within the Institute, for routine uses as defined in § 1182.2 as to any given system, or for such other uses as may be provided in this part.

      (4) Other than for access within the Institute to persons needing such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses as defined in § 1182.1, or such other uses as provided in this part, access to records within a system of records shall be permitted only to the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written request to the General Counsel.

      (5) Access to areas where a system of records is stored will be limited to those persons whose duties require work in such areas. There shall be an accounting of the removal of any records from such storage areas utilizing a log, as directed by the Chief Information Officer. The log shall be maintained at all times.

      (6) The Institute shall ensure that all persons whose duties require access to and use of records contained in a system of records are adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.

      (7) The disposal and destruction of records within a system of records shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the General Services Administration.

      (b)  (1) Identifiable personal information may be processed, stored, or maintained by automated data systems only where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to such systems in any form. Whenever such data, whether contained in punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, are not under the personal control of an authorized person, such information must be stored in a locked or secured room, or in such other facility having greater safeguards than those provided for in this part.

      (2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose duties require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times, including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.

      (3) All persons whose duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.

      (4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be done by shredding, burning, or, in the case of tapes or discs, degaussing, in accordance with regulations of the General Services Administration or other appropriate authority.

      § 1182.16   Procedures to ensure that Institute employees involved with its systems of records are familiar with the requirements of the Privacy Act.

#### § § 1182.16

      (a) The Director shall ensure that all persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any Institute system are informed of all requirements necessary to protect the privacy of subject individuals. The Director also shall ensure that all Institute employees having access to records receive adequate training in their protection, and that records have adequate and proper storage with sufficient security to assure the privacy of such records.

      (b) All employees shall be informed of the civil remedies provided under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1) and other implications of the Privacy Act, and the fact that the Institute may be subject to civil remedies for failure to comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act and the regulations in this part.

      § 1182.17   Institute systems of records that are covered by exemptions in the Privacy Act.

#### § § 1182.17

      (a) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the Institute system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except for subsections (b); (c)(1) and (2); (e)(4)(A) through (F); (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11); and (i), insofar as that Institute system contains information pertaining to criminal law enforcement investigations.

      (b) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Institute system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that Institute system consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of the exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).

      (c) The Institute system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” is exempt from the provisions of the Privacy Act noted in this section because their application might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence; disclose investigative techniques or procedures; reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses; or otherwise impair investigations.

      § 1182.18   Penalties for obtaining an Institute record under false pretenses.

#### § § 1182.18

      (a) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3), any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record from the Institute concerning an individual under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.

      (b) A person who falsely or fraudulently attempts to obtain records under the Privacy Act also may be subject to prosecution under other statutes, including 18 U.S.C. 494, 495, and 1001.

      § 1182.19   Restrictions that exist regarding the release of mailing lists.

#### § § 1182.19

      The Institute may not sell or rent an individual's name and address unless such action specifically is authorized by law. This section shall not be construed to require the withholding of names and addresses otherwise permitted to be made public.

    PART 1183 [RESERVED]

    PART 1184—IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT

### Part 1184

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552.

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 9423, Feb. 19, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1184.1   What are the purpose and scope of this part?

#### § § 1184.1

      (a) This part describe how the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) processes requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 as amended. The regulations in this part apply only to records that are both:

      (1) Created or obtained by IMLS; and

      (2) Under the agency's control at the time of the FOIA request.

      (b) The rules in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Act Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under 45 CFR part 1182 as well as under this part.

> [84 FR 22945, May 21, 2019]

      § 1184.2   What are IMLS's general policies with respect to FOIA?

#### § § 1184.2

      (a)  IMLS administers the FOIA with a presumption of openness. Under this presumption, IMLS makes discretionary disclosures of records whenever such disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or otherwise be prohibited by law.

      (b)  IMLS makes records available on its website Reading Room in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), as amended, as well as other records that have been requested three or more times or that, because of the nature of their subject matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests. IMLS establishes categories of records that can be disclosed regularly and proactively identifies and discloses additional records of interest to the public. To save time and money, and maximize efficiency, IMLS strongly urges individuals who seek information from IMLS to review documents available at the IMLS FOIA Electronic Reading Room before submitting a FOIA request.

      (c)  For purposes of this part, IMLS adopts all of the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act, and the OMB Guidelines, unless otherwise defined in this part.

      (1)  A request by or on behalf of anyone who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.

      (2)  Those expenses that IMLS actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16.1 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.

      (3)  The making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others.

      (4)  Any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research.

      (5)  The waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.

      (6)  An IMLS official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of FOIA requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.

      (7)  An institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.

      (8)  Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. Agencies will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (9)  One of the three categories that IMLS places requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, and include commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.

      (10)  The examination of a record located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes all of the processing that is necessary to prepare any record for disclosure, including, as applicable, redacting portions of the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential business information submitter under § 1184.9 but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicability of exemptions.

      (11)  The process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a FOIA request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from both hard copy and electronic records.

      (12)  A regular Federal work day constitutes a working day. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.

      § 1184.3   How do I request records?

#### § § 1184.3

      (a)  You may make a FOIA request for IMLS records by completing the online prompts in the FOIA Online Portal via FOIA.gov or via  or by sending an email to  or by submitting a request in writing via regular U.S. Mail addressed directly to the FOIA Public Liaison, Institute of Museum and Library Services, 955 L'Enfant Plaza North SW, Suite 4000, Washington, DC 20024-2135. Requests may also be sent in writing via facsimile to the FOIA Officer at (202) 653-4625.

      (b)  Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your name and mailing address, and should be clearly identified as a Freedom of Information Act or “FOIA” request. You must describe the records you seek with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to identify and locate the records, including, if possible, dates, subjects, titles, or authors of the records requested. Before submitting a request, you may contact IMLS's FOIA contact or FOIA Officer to discuss the records you seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If upon receiving your request IMLS determines that it does not reasonably describe the requested records, IMLS will advise you what additional information is required to perfect your request, or why your request is otherwise insufficient. You should also indicate if you have a preferred form or format in which you would like to receive the requested records.

      (c)  IMLS will provide the responsive records in the form or format you request if the records are readily reproducible by IMLS in that form or format. IMLS will make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure. IMLS may disclose records in electronic format if the records can be downloaded or transferred intact through electronic media currently in use by the agency. In responding to a request for records, IMLS will make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except where such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system(s).

      (d)  IMLS considers a request that complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to be a perfected request. The agency considers a request to be received on the date that the request is perfected.

> [79 FR 9423, Feb. 19, 2014, as amended at 84 FR 22946, May 21, 2019]

      § 1184.4   When will I receive a response to my request?

#### § § 1184.4

      (a)  IMLS will ordinarily grant, partially grant, or deny your request for records within 20 working days after receiving a perfected request.

      (b)  (1) Where the time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, the FOIA Officer will notify you as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and may extend the response period for up to ten (10) working days.

      (2) Where the extension is for more than ten (10) working days, the FOIA Officer will provide you with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an agreed upon alternative time period for processing the request or a modified request.

      (c)  (1) IMLS must process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

      (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.

      (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted as required by § 1184.6.

      (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, IMLS may waive the formal certification requirement.

      (4) IMLS must notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, IMLS must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.

> [79 FR 9423, Feb. 19, 2014, as amended at 84 FR 22946, May 21, 2019]

      § 1184.5   How will my request be processed?

#### § § 1184.5

      (a)  IMLS will assign a tracking number to your request and will, as soon as practicable, advise you in writing of this tracking number, and, as appropriate, a brief description of the request, and relevant IMLS contact information, including the name and contact information of the FOIA Public Liaison.

      (b)  If there is any uncertainty, IMLS will attempt to communicate with you to clarify the scope of your request.

      (c)  Upon request, IMLS will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, IMLS may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.

      (d)  Whenever IMLS refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, IMLS will notify you of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred.

      (e)  When responsive records are located, IMLS will apply a presumption of disclosure and openness. If IMLS decides to grant your request in whole or in part, the agency will notify you in writing. The notice will include any applicable fee and the agency will disclose records to you promptly upon payment of applicable fees. IMLS will mark or annotate any records disclosed in part to show the amount, the location, and the FOIA exemptions under which the redaction is made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

      (f)  Denials of your FOIA request, either whole or in part, will be made in writing by the FOIA Public Liaison. IMLS will inform you of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the agency in denying the request, and notify you of your right to appeal the determination as described in § 1184.6. IMLS will, as appropriate, provide a brief description of the information being withheld. In addition, IMLS will provide information about the mediation services provided by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration.

      § 1184.6   How can I appeal a denial of my request?

#### § § 1184.6

      (a)  If your FOIA request has been denied in whole or in part, or if the agency has not found any records in response to your request, you may file an appeal no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the date of the notification of denial. Your appeal must include a description of the initial request, the reason for the appeal, and why you believe the agency's response was incorrect. Your appeal must be in writing, signed, and filed with the IMLS Director, c/o Office of the General Counsel, 955 L'Enfant Plaza North SW, Suite 4000, Washington, DC 20024-2135. Appeals may also be sent via email to  or via facsimile to (202) 653-4625.

      (b)  The Director of IMLS will make a determination with respect to your appeal within twenty (20) working days after the agency has received the appeal, except as provided in § 1184.4(b). If the decision on appeal is favorable to you, the Director of IMLS will take action to assure prompt dispatch of the records to you. If the decision on appeal is adverse to you, in whole or in part, you will be informed by the Director of IMLS of the reasons for the decision and of the provisions for judicial review set forth in the FOIA. As appropriate, IMLS will advise you in a response to an appeal that the 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

      § 1184.7   How will fees be charged?

#### § § 1184.7

      (a)  IMLS will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with FOIA requests. IMLS will charge fees to recover all allowable direct costs incurred, and may charge fees for searching for and reviewing requested records even if the records are determined to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. IMLS will charge fees in accordance with the category of the FOIA requester.

      (1)  IMLS will assess charges to recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating the requested records. IMLS may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure.

      (2)  IMLS will charge for duplication costs.

      (3)  IMLS will charge for duplication costs.

      (4)  IMLS will assess charges to recover the full direct cost for searching for and duplicating the requested records.

      (5)  IMLS' decision regarding the categorization of a requester will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the requester's intended use of the requested records.

      (b)  The following fees will be charged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

      (1)  The fee charged will be the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the search.

      (2)  The fee charged will be the actual direct cost of providing the service including the cost of operating the central processing unit for the operating time that is directly attributed to searching for records responsive to a request and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.

      (3)  The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.

      (4)  Copies of records photocopied on an 8  × 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page. For duplication of other materials, the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.

      (c)  (1) Except for records provided in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two (2) hours of search time will be provided at no charge.

      (2) Fees will not be charged to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the total amount calculated under this section is less than $25.

      (d)  If the total fee charges are likely to exceed $25, IMLS will notify you of the estimated amount of the charges, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review and/or duplication, unless you have indicated in advance that you are willing to pay higher fees and will offer you an opportunity to confer with the FOIA Public Liaison to revise the request to meet your needs at a lower cost.

      (e)  (1) IMLS will disclose records without charge or at a reduced charge if the agency determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) IMLS will use the following factors to determine whether a fee will be waived or reduced:

      (i)  Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the “operations or activities of the government”;

      (ii)  Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;

      (iii)  Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”;

      (iv)  Whether disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;

      (v)  Whether you have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure; and if so

      (vi)  Whether the magnitude of your commercial interest is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the your commercial interest.

      (f)  (1) If you fail to pay your bill within thirty (30) days, interest will accrue from the date the bill was mailed, and will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

      (2) If IMLS reasonably believes that you are attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the agency may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.

      (3)  (i) Advance payment of fees will generally not be required. IMLS may request an advance payment of the fee, however, if:

      (A) The charges are likely to exceed $250; or

      (B) You have failed previously to pay a fee in a timely fashion.

      (ii) When IMLS requests an advance payment, the time limits described in section (a)(6) of the FOIA will begin only after IMLS has received advanced full payment in full.

      (g)  In the absence of unusual or exceptional circumstances, IMLS will not assess fees if the agency fails to comply with any time limit set forth in this part, unless the agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request.

      (h)  IMLS may waive fees in other circumstances solely at its discretion, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552.

      § 1184.9   What are IMLS' policies regarding disclosure of confidential business information?

#### § § 1184.9

      (a)  Confidential business information obtained by IMLS from a submitter will be disclosed under FOIA only under this section.

      (b)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      (1)  Commercial or financial information obtained by IMLS from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of FOIA.

      (2)  Any person or entity from whom IMLS obtains confidential business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.

      (c)  A submitter of confidential business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.

      (d)  When required under paragraph (e) of this section, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (h) of this section, IMLS will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its confidential business information, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information. The notice will either describe the confidential business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.

      (e)  IMLS will give notice to a submitter wherever:

      (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (2) IMLS has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.

      (f)  IMLS will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written statement to IMLS. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not received by IMLS until after the agency's disclosure decision has been made will not be considered by IMLS. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

      (g)  IMLS will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential business information. If IMLS decides to disclose confidential business information over the objection of a submitter, IMLS will give the submitter written notice, which will include:

      (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the confidential business information to be disclosed; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.

      (h)  The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:

      (1) IMLS determines that the information should not be disclosed;

      (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600; or

      (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous—except that, in such a case, IMLS will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.

      (i)  If a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential business information, IMLS will promptly notify the submitter of the filing of the lawsuit.

      (j)  If IMLS provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, IMLS will also notify the requester(s). If IMLS notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, IMLS will also notify the requester(s). If a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of confidential business information, IMLS will notify the requester(s) of the filing of the lawsuit.

      § 1184.10   Disclaimer.
