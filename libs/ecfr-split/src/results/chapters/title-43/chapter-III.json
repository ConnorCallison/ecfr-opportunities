The Commission considers implementation of measures that result from a formal NEPA procedure to be non-discretionary. The Commission recognizes a commitment to implement such measures as are within its authority. Further, in accordance with Section 301(f)(3), the Commission is committed to giving these measures high priority. In order to ensure that such measures are consistent with the Commission's overall program, and can be implemented within budget, the Commission will take an active role in NEPA procedures that are likely to result in significant mitigation obligations for the Commission. \n",
              "(5) If the Commission chooses not to implement a mitigation measure or, for any reason be unable to implement a measure resulting from NEPA procedures, the Commission will conduct, or cause to have conducted, a supplemental environmental evaluation to determine suitable alternative mitigation measures. The Commission will implement the findings of that evaluation to the extent possible. The only exception will be when the Commission proposes to substitute an equivalent mitigation measure that meets with the approval of applicable Federal, State, or Tribal fish and wildlife agencies, the Secretary of the Interior, and other affected parties. \n",

The Act specifically recognizes the authority of other Federal and State agencies to take actions in accordance with other applicable laws. The guidance for this is provided by Section 301(a)(2), which states that “Nothing herein is intended to limit or restrict the authorities of Federal, State, or local governments, or political subdivisions thereof, to plan, develop, or implement mitigation, conservation, or enhancement of fish, wildlife, or recreation resources in the State in accordance with applicable provisions of Federal or State law.” In preparing and implementing its plan, it is the Commission's intent to form a cooperative partnership with other agencies having fish, wildlife, and recreation responsibilities and authorities, both recognizing and relying upon their authorities. The Commission recognizes that these agencies may have specific legal obligations to take actions to maintain or restore fish, wildlife, or recreation resources that are independent of Commission mandates. While the Commission will, as appropriate, authorize the use of funds to complement the resource protection and restoration activities of these agencies, Commission involvement should not be viewed as a replacement for funding or other actions that are rightfully the responsibility of another agency. \n",

In Section 301(b)(3), the Act specifically references a Commission obligation to comply with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Other acts administered by the Service and relevant to Commission activities include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 ) and the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d). The FWCA directs that the Service, and the state fish and wildlife agency, must be consulted where the “waters of any stream or other body of water are proposed or authorized to be impounded, diverted * * * or otherwise controlled or modified * * * by any department or agency of the United States, or by any public or private agency under Federal permit or license. * * *” The purpose of this consultation is to provide for “the conservation of wildlife resources by preventing loss of and damage to such resources.” The FWCA provides the major mechanism for Service involvement in the Federal reclamation project decision process. The Service's most important role in Federal reclamation projects is in the development and later the monitoring of fish and wildlife mitigation measures. The Service is also responsible for reporting to the Secretary of the Interior on the status of mitigation programs. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act provides for the funding of Service FWCA consultation by the agency sponsoring the proposed activity. The Service's ESA responsibilities that are most relevant to Commission activities include listing of new species, preparation and implementation of recovery plans and consultations regarding adverse effects on listed species. Section 7(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act authorizes Federal agencies to carry out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Participating in, and being consistent with, recovery plans is a fundamental component of this obligation. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that, prior to taking any action that may affect a listed species, a Federal agency must consult with the Service to ensure that the action will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify critical habitat. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) establishes a Federal role in protecting bird species that generally migrate across national boundaries. In Utah, these include most indigenous bird species. The MBTA is not intended as a substitute for state wildlife management authority but rather as a complement. The Service is responsible for implementing many of the features of the MBTA, and for encouraging states to undertake actions to protect migratory bird species. The Bald Eagle Protection Act prohibits the taking or possession of either bald or golden eagles, both of which commonly inhabit areas near Utah's rivers and wetlands.

              "The terms “mitigation” and “conservation” are used repeatedly throughout the Act and committee reports accompanying the Act. The importance of these terms is exemplified by the fact that Congress saw fit to include them in the official name of the Commission. The Commission interprets the term “mitigation” to mean activities undertaken to avoid or lessen environmental impacts associated with a Federal reclamation project or, should impact occur, to protect, restore, or enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources adversely affected by the project. Mitigation at the site of the impact typically involves restoration or replacement. Off-site mitigation might involve protection, restoration, or enhancement of a similar resource value at a different location. Mitigation may also involve substituting one resource feature for another. In meeting its mitigation responsibilities, the Commission sees an obligation to give priority to protection and restoration activities that are within the same watershed as the original impact and that address the same fish, wildlife, or recreation resource that was originally affected. The Commission's “conservation” authority allows it to invest in the conservation of fish, wildlife, and recreation resources generally, and not directly associated with any Federal reclamation project. Conservation projects may, therefore, be considered for any area of the state, regardless of the presence of a reclamation project. Nothing in this section is meant to restrict consideration of conservation projects directly associated with a Federal reclamation project. The Commission recognizes that, with limited resources, it is not possible to address the entire range of fish, wildlife, and recreation needs throughout the State. Indeed, addressing only the most critical issues will require prudent and judicious planning and use of resources. This section defines the areas where the Commission intends to focus its attention over the long-term and, in so doing, provides guidance for the development of the Commission's mitigation and conservation plan. By defining priorities, the Commission narrows the options of applicants in making recommendations for potential projects, and of the Commission itself in selecting measures to be incorporated into the plan. \n",

The Commission believes that, to be effective, the plan must be prepared, and evaluated, from a state-wide perspective and that, within the state, an ecosystem-based approach is appropriate. There is no one correct way to define an ecosystem or to approach ecosystem planning. The Commission concludes that, for its planning purposes, the watershed provides the appropriate geographic and ecological reference within which to evaluate proposed projects and otherwise plan its activities. In delineating watersheds, the Commission will be consistent with the best ecological and hydrological science and, to the extent possible, with the ecological and hydrological units currently used by the State of Utah, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other applicable Federal agencies. The Commission recognizes that mitigation and conservation projects may vary in scale and that, therefore, one standard set of watersheds is not necessarily appropriate for all projects. For example, a more localized project may best be analyzed from a “watershed within a watershed” perspective. Alternatively, a large-scaled project may need to be visualized from the perspective of a major river basin consisting of several watersheds. The Commission will prepare, and have available for public use, a list or map that identifies major basins, watersheds, and, where appropriate, hydrologic units within watersheds, that the Commission will use to organize its mitigation and conservation activities. This list or map may be revised from time to time as circumstances change. \n\n\n"

Portions of the plan that are proposed for modification will be released in draft form, with the public given thirty days to provide comments prior to formal adoption by the Commission. Substantive amendments provide a way to incrementally amend the plan over time without the necessity of a major rewrite and will be central to the Commission's planning process. The Commission will specifically consider the need for substantive amendments on at least an annual basis. Consideration of substantive amendments will typically be made in concert with preparation of the annual budget request. \n",
