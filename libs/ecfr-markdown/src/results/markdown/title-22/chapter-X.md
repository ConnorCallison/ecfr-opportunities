#### § § 1004.4

    The IAF shall open every portion of every meeting of the agency for public observation.

    (2) In fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of the agency;

    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:

    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,

    (2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial of an impartial adjudication,

    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

This shall not apply in any instance where the IAF has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or where the IAF is required by law to make such disclosure of its own initiative prior to taking final IAF action on such proposal;

    (j) Specifically concern the IAF's issuance of subpoena, or the IAF's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the IAF of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of this title or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.

    § 1004.5   Procedures for announcing meetings.

#### § § 1004.5

Such announcement shall be made unless a majority of the Board of Directors of the IAF determines by a recorded vote that the IAF requires that such a meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the IAF shall make public announcement of the time, place and subject matter of such meeting and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practical time.

    (b) Immediately following the public announcement, the IAF will submit notice for publication in the

    § 1004.6   Procedures for closing meetings.

#### § § 1004.6

    (a) The closing of a meeting or a portion of a meeting shall occur only when:

    (1) A majority of the membership of the IAF Board votes to take such action. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portions of a series of meetings may be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in § 1004.4 and whether or not the public interest nevertheless requires that portion of the meeting or meetings remain open. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Board member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.

    (2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the IAF close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in § 1004.4 the IAF, upon request of any one of its Board members, shall take a recorded vote, whether to close such portion of the meeting.

    (b) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to this Section, the IAF shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question and full written explanation of its action closing the entire or portion of the meeting together with a list of persons expecting to attend the meeting and their affiliation.

    (c) The IAF shall, subject to change, announce the time, place and subject matter of the meeting at least 7 days before the meeting.

    (d) For every closed meeting pursuant to § 1004.4, the General Counsel of the IAF shall publicly certify prior to a Board of Directors' vote on closing the meeting, that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the IAF.

    § 1004.7   Reconsideration of opening or closing of meeting.

#### § § 1004.7

    The time or place of a Board meeting may be changed, without vote, following public announcement. The IAF will announce any such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the agency to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed only if a majority of the Board of Directors determines by a recorded vote that IAF business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the IAF publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time.

    § 1004.8   Transcripts, recording of closed meetings.

#### § § 1004.8

    (a) The IAF shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d), (h), or (j) of § 1004.4, the IAF shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such records shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflecting the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such records.

    (b) The IAF, after review by the General Counsel shall make promptly available to the public, in a place easily accessible to the public, the transcript or electronic recording or minutes of the discussion of any time on the agenda, or any item of the testimony of any witness received at the Board meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the IAF determines to contain information which may be withheld under § 1004.4. Copies of such transcript, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. The IAF shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion or any IAF proceedings with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.

    § 1005.140   Employment.

#### § § 1005.140

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

#### § §§ 1005.141-1005.148

    § 1005.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1005.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1005.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1005.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1005.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1005.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1005.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 1005.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1005.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

#### § § 1005.160

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

  PART 1006—GOVERNMENTWIDE DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT)

### Part 1006

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); E.O. 12549, 3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189; E.O. 12689, 3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1006.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 1006.100

      This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for Inter-American Foundation nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

      § 1006.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1006.105

      Portions of this part (see table at § 1006.25(b)) apply to you if you are a(n)—

      (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;

      (b) Respondent (a person against whom the Inter-American Foundation has initiated a debarment or suspension action);

      (c) Inter-American Foundation debarring or suspending official; or

      (d) Inter-American Foundation official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

      § 1006.110   What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

#### § § 1006.110

      (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.

      (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.

      (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

      § 1006.115   How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

#### § § 1006.115

      With the exceptions stated in §§ 1006.120, 1006.315, and 1006.420, a person who is excluded by the Inter-American Foundation or any other Federal agency may not:

      (a) Be a participant in a(n) Inter-American Foundation transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;

      (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for debarment and suspension; or

      (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.

      § 1006.120   May we grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.120

      (a) The Inter-American Foundation Debarring Official may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Inter-American Foundation Debarring Official grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

      (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.

      § 1006.125   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

#### § § 1006.125

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.

      § 1006.130   Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 1006.130

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.

      § 1006.135   May the Inter-American Foundation exclude a person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

#### § § 1006.135

      Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.

      § 1006.140   How do I know if a person is excluded?

#### § § 1006.140

      Check the  to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the  and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the

      § 1006.145   Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 1006.145

      Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part—

      (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to—

      (1) Provide for their inclusion in the  and

      (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

      (b) Does not specify the—

      (1) Inter-American Foundation transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;

      (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or

      (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 1006.200   What is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.200

      A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at—

      (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

      (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

      § 1006.205   Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.205

      The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

      (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

      (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

      (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless—

      (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 1006.310 or § 1006.415; or

      (2) A(n) Inter-American Foundation official obtains an exception from the Inter-American Foundation Debarring Official to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 1006.120.

      § 1006.210   Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

#### § § 1006.210

      All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 1006.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 1006.215. (See appendix to this part.)

      § 1006.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

#### § § 1006.215

      The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

      (a) A direct award to—

      (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

      (2) A public international organization;

      (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

      (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

      (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301  those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

      (c) Federal employment.

      (d) A transaction that the Inter-American Foundation needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

      (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the Inter-American Foundation specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

      (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

      (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.

      § 1006.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

#### § § 1006.220

      (a) Covered transactions under this part—

      (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

      (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).

      (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

      (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1006.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Inter-American Foundation official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

      (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

      § 1006.225   How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.225

      As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      Doing Business With Other Persons

        § 1006.300   What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?

#### § § 1006.300

        When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:

        (a) Checking the  or

        (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this rule; or

        (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person.

        § 1006.305   May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person?

#### § § 1006.305

        (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person, unless the Inter-American Foundation grants an exception under § 1006.120.

        (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or regulation.

#### § § 1006.310

        (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the Inter-American Foundation grants an exception under § 1006.120.

        § 1006.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.315

        (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the Inter-American Foundation grants an exception under § 1006.120.

        § 1006.320   Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?

#### § § 1006.320

        Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not required to, check the

        § 1006.325   What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1006.325

        If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.

        § 1006.330   What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 1006.330

        Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—

        (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless § 1006.440 requires you to use specific methods.

        (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

      Disclosing Information—Primary Tier Participants

        (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;

        (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed in § 1006.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;

        (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in § 1006.800(a); or

        (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.

        § 1006.340   If I disclose unfavorable information required under § 1006.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

#### § § 1006.340

        As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable information about yourself or a principal under § 1006.335 will not necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the disclosed information.

        § 1006.345   What happens if I fail to disclose information required under § 1006.335?

#### § § 1006.345

        (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

        (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

        § 1006.350   What must I do if I learn of information required under § 1006.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the Inter-American Foundation?

#### § § 1006.350

        At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must give immediate written notice to the Inter-American Foundation office with which you entered into the transaction if you learn either that—

        (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by § 1006.335; or

        (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for the transaction now meet any of the criteria in § 1006.335.

      Disclosing Information—Lower Tier Participants

        § 1006.355   What information must I provide to a higher tier participant before entering into a covered transaction with that participant?

You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

      (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 1006.120.

      § 1006.420   May I approve a transaction with an excluded or disqualified person at a lower tier?

#### § § 1006.420

#### § § 1006.435

      You as an agency official must require each participant in a primary tier covered transaction to—

    Subpart E—Excluded Parties List System

      § 1006.500   What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)?

#### § § 1006.500

      The  is a widely available source of the most current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.

      § 1006.505   Who uses the EPLS?

    Subpart F—General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions

      § 1006.600   How do suspension and debarment actions start?

#### § § 1006.600

      When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.

      § 1006.605   How does suspension differ from debarment?

#### § § 1006.605

      Suspension differs from debarment in that—

      § 1006.610   What procedures does the Inter-American Foundation use in suspension and debarment actions?

#### § § 1006.610

      In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.

      (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.

      (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.

      § 1006.615   How does the Inter-American Foundation notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?

      (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.

      (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.

      § 1006.620   Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

#### § § 1006.620

      Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.

      § 1006.625   What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

#### § § 1006.625

      If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

      (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited—

      (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or

      (2) To specific types of transactions.

      (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official—

      (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and

      (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.

      § 1006.630   May the Inter-American Foundation impute conduct of one person to another?

#### § § 1006.630

      For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct as follows:

      (a)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      (b)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.

      (c)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      § 1006.635   May the Inter-American Foundation settle a debarment or suspension action?

#### § § 1006.635

      Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

      § 1006.640   May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

#### § § 1006.640

      Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide effect.

#### § § 1006.645

      (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into the

    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 1006.700   When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

#### § § 1006.700

      Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—

      (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 1006.800(a), or

      (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 1006.800(b) through (d); and

      (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

      § 1006.705   What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

#### § § 1006.705

      (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

      (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

      (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

      § 1006.710   When does a suspension take effect?

#### § § 1006.710

      A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

      § 1006.715   What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?

#### § § 1006.715

      After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you—

      (a) That you have been suspended;

      (b) That your suspension is based on—

      (1) An indictment;

      (2) A conviction;

      (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government dealings with you; or

      (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;

      (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;

      (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under § 1006.700 for imposing suspension;

      (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;

      (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this part, and any other Inter-American Foundation procedures governing suspension decision making; and

      (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.

      § 1006.720   How may I contest a suspension?

#### § § 1006.720

      If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your representative must provide the suspending official with information in opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.

      § 1006.725   How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

#### § § 1006.725

      (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or make rrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to the suspending official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of Suspension.

      (b) We consider the notice to be received by you—

      (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;

      (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or

      (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.

      § 1006.730   What information must I provide to the suspending official if I contest a suspension?

#### § § 1006.730

      (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify—

      (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;

      (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

      (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

      (4) All of your affiliates.

      (b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the Inter-American Foundation may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.

      § 1006.735   Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

#### § § 1006.735

      (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;

      (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Suspension;

      (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or

      (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.

      (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

      (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension.

      (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

      § 1006.740   Are suspension proceedings formal?

#### § § 1006.740

      (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision.

      (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

      § 1006.745   How is fact-finding conducted?

      § 1006.750   What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

#### § § 1006.750

      (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes—

      (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial decision to suspend you;

      (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or opposition to, the suspension; and

      (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

      (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

      § 1006.755   When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

#### § § 1006.755

      The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.

      § 1006.760   How long may my suspension last?

#### § § 1006.760

      (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

      (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

    Subpart H—Debarment

      § 1006.800   What are the causes for debarment?

      § 1006.860   What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

#### § § 1006.860

      This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

      (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

      (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.

      (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

      (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

#### § § 1006.865

      (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based.

#### § § 1006.870

      (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.

      (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 1006.615 that the official decided, either—

      § 1006.875   May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?

#### § § 1006.875

      Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and support it with documentation.

      § 1006.880   What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

#### § § 1006.880

      The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on—

      (a) Newly discovered material evidence;

      (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

      (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

      (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.

      § 1006.885   May the debarring official extend a debarment?

#### § § 1006.885

      (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.

      (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.

      (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to extend the debarment.

Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.

  PART 1008—GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

### Part 1008

**Authority:** Authority: 41 U.S.C. 701

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66590, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 1008.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 1008.100

      This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

      § 1008.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1008.105

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

      (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Inter-American Foundation; or

      (2) A(n) Inter-American Foundation awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 1008.605 and 1008.660, respectively.)

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 1008.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 1008.110

      This part does not apply to any award that the Inter-American Foundation President or designee determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

      § 1008.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 1008.115

      It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 1008.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 1008.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 1008.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 1008.205 through 1008.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 1008.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 1008.230).

      § 1008.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1008.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 1008.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1008.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 1008.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      § 1008.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 1008.215

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 1008.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 1008.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 1008.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 1008.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 1008.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 1008.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1008.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

      (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

      (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either—

      (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

      (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

      § 1008.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 1008.230

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Inter-American Foundation award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

      (1) To the Inter-American Foundation official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by Inter-American Foundation officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (, all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the Inter-American Foundation awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the Inter-American Foundation awarding official.

    Subpart C—Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

      § 1008.300   What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

#### § § 1008.300

      As a condition of receiving a(n) Inter-American Foundation award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that—

      (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and

      (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the Inter-American Foundation awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 1008.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

      § 1008.301   [Reserved]

#### § § 1008.301

    Subpart D—Responsibilities of Inter-American Foundation Awarding Officials

      § 1008.400   What are my responsibilities as a(n) Inter-American Foundation awarding official?

#### § § 1008.400

      As a(n) Inter-American Foundation awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in—

      (a) Subpart B of this part, if the recipient is not an individual; or

      (b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

    Subpart E—Violations of this Part and Consequences

      § 1008.500   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 1008.500

      A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Inter-American Foundation President or designee determines, in writing, that—

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

      § 1008.505   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 1008.505

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart C of this part; or

      (b) The recipient is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity.

      § 1008.510   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 1008.510

      If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 1008.500 or § 1008.505, the Inter-American Foundation may take one or more of the following actions—

      § 1008.515   Are there any exceptions to those actions?

#### § § 1008.515

      The Inter-American Foundation may waive with respect to a particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the Inter-American Foundation determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.
