In this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient. \n",

If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 1110.6(d) to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served. \n",

In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service. \n"

                  "(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:\n",
                  "(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n",
                  "(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Arts Endowment will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\n",
                  "(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Arts Endowment will consider the following criteria:\n",
                  "(A) The Arts Endowment will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n",
                  "(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Arts Endowment will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Arts Endowment ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the factors in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n",
                  "(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.\n",
                  "(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Arts Endowment and should address the criteria referenced in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.\n"

FOIA applies to requests for records concerning the general activities of the government and of the NEH in particular.

NEH will mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to NEH, explaining the agency's requirements concerning these charges, except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.\n",

                      "(2) Unless otherwise established in a grant, cooperate agreement, contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest that NEH charges will be the rate that the Secretary establishes annually in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.

                      "(3) The rate of interest that NEH initially charges will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, NEH may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Treasury's value of funds at the time the new agreement is executed. NEH will not compound interest; that is, it will not charge interest on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section.

This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency.\n",

The cost-of-living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. NEH will annually compute increases to administrative debts. NEH will use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the debt's age.\n",

For purposes of this paragraph (f), “contingency fees” are administrative costs resulting from fees paid by a Federal agency to other Federal agencies or private collection contractors for collection services rendered when the fees are paid from the amounts collected from a debtor.\n",

NEH may extend this thirty-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, NEH may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if NEH determines that collection of these charges is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States.\n",

NEH will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection.

In determining the litigative risks involved, NEH will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.\n",
                      "(e) NEH may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount NEH accepts in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, NEH will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.\n",
                      "(f) NEH generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, NEH will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the debtor's full original principal balance prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, will be reinstated. Whenever possible, NEH also will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in subpart B of this part.\n",
                      "(g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a reasonable time, NEH will obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. NEH also may obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise offers. NEH may use its own financial information form or may request suitable forms from DOJ or the local United States Attorney's Office.\n\n\n"
