#### § § 327.30

    (a)  The purpose of this regulation is to provide policy and guidance on management of shorelines of Civil Works projects where 36 CFR part 327 is applicable.

    (b)  This regulation is applicable to all field operating agencies with Civil Works responsibilities except when such application would result in an impingement upon existing Indian rights.

    (c)  (1) Section 4, 1944 Flood Control Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 460d).

    (2) The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1894, as amended and supplemented (33 U.S.C. 1)

    (3) Section 10, River and Harbor Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403).

    (7) The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-662).

    (8) Title 36, chapter III, part 327, Code of Federal Regulations, “Rules and Regulations Governing Public Use of Water Resource Development Projects Administered by the Chief of Engineers.”

    (9) Executive Order 12088 (13 Oct. 78).

    (10) 33 CFR parts 320-330, “Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engineers.”

    (11) ER 1130-2-400, “Management of Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation at Civil Works Water Resource Projects.”

    (12) EM 385-1-1, “Safety and Health Requirements Manual.”

    (d)  (1) It is the policy of the Chief of Engineers to protect and manage shorelines of all Civil Works water resource development projects under Corps jurisdiction in a manner which will promote the safe and healthful use of these shorelines by the public while maintaining environmental safeguards to ensure a quality resource for use by the public. The objectives of all management actions will be to achieve a balance between permitted private uses and resource protection for general public use. Public pedestrian access to and exit from these shorelines shall be preserved. For projects or portions of projects where Federal real estate interest is limited to easement title only, management actions will be appropriate within the limits of the estate acquired.

    (2) Private shoreline uses may be authorized in designated areas consistent with approved use allocations specified in Shoreline Management Plans. Except to honor written commitments made prior to publication of this regulation, private shoreline uses are not allowed on water resource projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on water resource projects where no private shoreline uses existed as of that date. Any existing permitted facilities on these projects will be grandfathered until the facilities fail to meet the criteria set forth in § 327.30(h).

    (3) A Shoreline Management Plan, as described in § 327.30(e), will be prepared for each Corps project where private shoreline use is allowed. This plan will honor past written commitments. The plan will be reviewed at least once every five years and revised as necessary. Shoreline uses that do not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms or result in significant environmental effects should be allowed unless the public participation process identifies problems in these areas. If sufficient demand exists, consideration should be given to revising the shoreline allocations (e.g. increases/decreases). Maximum public participation will be encouraged as set forth in § 327.30(e)(6). Except to honor written commitments made prior to the publication of this regulation, shoreline management plans are not required for those projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on projects not having private shoreline use as of that date. In that case, a statement of policy will be developed by the district commander to present the shoreline management policy. This policy statement will be subject to the approval of the division commander. For projects where two or more agencies have jurisdiction, the plan will be cooperatively prepared with the Corps as coordinator.

    (4) Where commercial or other public launching and/or moorage facilities are not available within a reasonable distance, group owned mooring facilities may be allowed in Limited Development Areas to limit the proliferation of individual facilities. Generally only one permit will be necessary for a group owned mooring facility with that entity, if incorporated, or with one person from the organization designated as the permittee and responsible for all moorage spaces within the facility. No charge may be made for use of any permitted facility by others nor shall any commercial activity be engaged in thereon.

    (5) The issuance of a private shoreline use permit does not convey any real estate or personal property rights or exclusive use rights to the permit holder. The public's right of access and use of the permit area must be maintained and preserved. Owners of permitted facilities may take necessary precautions to protect their property from theft, vandalism or trespass, but may in no way preclude the public right of pedestrian or vessel access to the water surface or public land adjacent to the facility.

    (6) Shoreline Use Permits will only be issued to individuals or groups with legal right of access to public lands.

    (e) —(1)  The policies outlined in § 327.30(d) will be implemented through preparation of _Shoreline Management Plan_s, where private shoreline use is allowed.

    (2)  A Shoreline Management Plan is prepared as part of the Operational Management Plan. A moratorium on accepting applications for new permits may be placed in effect from the time an announcement of creation of a plan or formal revision of a plan is made until the action is completed.

    (3)  Approval of Shoreline Management Plans rests with division commanders. After approval, one copy of each project Shoreline Management Plan will be forwarded to HQUSACE (CECW-ON) WASH DC 20314-1000. Copies of the approved plan will also be made available to the public.

    (4)  The Shoreline Management Plan will consist of a map showing the shoreline allocated to the uses listed in § 327.30(e)(6), related rules and regulations, a discussion of what areas are open or closed to specific activities and facilities, how to apply for permits and other information pertinent to the Corps management of the shoreline. The plan will be prepared in sufficient detail to ensure that it is clear to the public what uses are and are not allowed on the shoreline of the project and why. A process will be developed and presented in the Shoreline Management Plan that prescribes a procedure for review of activities requested but not specifically addressed by the Shoreline Management Plan.

    (5)  The entire shoreline will be allocated within the classifications below and delineated on a map. Any action, within the context of this rule, which gives a special privilege to an individual or group of individuals on land or water at a Corps project, that precludes use of those lands and waters by the general public, is considered to be private shoreline use. Shoreline allocations cover that land and/or water extending from the edge of the water and waterward with the exception of allocations for the purpose of vegetation modification which extends landward to the project boundary. These allocations should complement, but certainly not contradict, the land classifications in the project master plan. A map of sufficient size and scale to clearly display the shoreline allocations will be conspicuously displayed or readily available for viewing in the project administration office and will serve as the authoritative reference. Reduced or smaller scale maps may be developed for public dissemination but the information contained on these must be identical to that contained on the display map in the project administration office. No changes will be made to these maps except through the formal update process. District commanders may add specific constraints and identify areas having unique characteristics during the plan preparation, review, or updating process in addition to the allocation classifications described below.

    (i)  Limited Development Areas are those areas in which private facilities and/or activities may be allowed consistent with § 327.30(h) and appendix A. Modification of vegetation by individuals may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit in accordance with appendix A. Potential low and high water conditions and underwater topography should be carefully evaluated before shoreline is allocated as Limited Development Area.

    (ii)  Public Recreation Areas are those areas designated for commercial concessionaire facilities, Federal, state or other similar public use. No private shoreline use facilities and/or activities will be permitted within or near designated or developed public recreation areas. The term “near” depends on the terrain, road system, and other local conditions, so actual distances must be established on a case by case basis in each project Shoreline Management Plan. No modification of land forms or vegetation by private individuals or groups of individuals is permitted in public recreation areas.

    (iii)  Protected Shoreline Areas are those areas designated to maintain or restore aesthetic, fish and wildlife, cultural, or other environmental values. Shoreline may also be so designated to prevent development in areas that are subject to excessive siltation, erosion, rapid dewatering, or exposure to high wind, wave, or current action and/or in areas in which development would interfere with navigation. No Shoreline Use Permits for floating or fixed recreation facilities will be allowed in protected areas. Some modification of vegetation by private individuals, such as clearing a narrow meandering path to the water, or limited mowing, may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit if the resource manager determines that the activity will not adversely impact the environment or physical characteristics for which the area was designated as protected. In making this determination the effect on water quality will also be considered.

    (iv)  Prohibited Access Areas are those in which public access is not allowed or is restricted for health, safety or security reasons. These could include hazardous areas near dams, spillways, hydro-electric power stations, work areas, water intake structures, etc. No shoreline use permits will be issued in _Prohibited Access Areas._

    (6)  District commanders will ensure public participation to the maximum practicable extent in Shoreline Management Plan formulation, preparation and subsequent revisions. This may be accomplished by public meetings, group workshops, open houses or other public involvement techniques. When master plan updates and preparation of the Shoreline Management Plans are concurrent, public participation may be combined and should consider all aspects of both plans, including shoreline allocation classifications. Public participation will begin during the initial formulation stage and must be broad-based to cover all aspects of public interest. The key to successful implementation is an early and continual public relations program. Projects with significant numbers of permits should consider developing computerized programs to facilitate exchange of information with permittees and to improve program efficiency. Special care will be taken to advise citizen and conservation organizations; Federal, state and local natural resource management agencies; Indian Tribes; the media; commercial concessionaires; congressional liaisons; adjacent landowners and other concerned entities during the formulation of Shoreline Management Plans and subsequent revisions. Notices shall be published prior to public meetings to assure maximum public awareness. Public notices shall be issued by the district commander allowing for a minimum of 30 days for receipt of written public comment in regard to the proposed Shoreline Management Plan or any major revision thereto.

    (7)  Shoreline Management Plans will be reviewed periodically, but no less often than every five years, by the district commander to determine the need for update. If sufficient controversy or demand exists, consideration should be given, consistent with other factors, to a process of reevaluation of the shoreline allocations and the plan. When changes to the Shoreline Management Plan are needed, the plan will be formally updated through the public participation process. Cumulative environmental impacts of permit actions and the possibility of preparing or revising project NEPA documentation will be considered. District commanders may make minor revisions to the Shoreline Management Plan when the revisions are consistent with policy and funds for a complete plan update are not available. The amount and type of public involvement needed for such revision is at the discretion of the district commander.

    (f)  Instruments used to authorize private shoreline use facilities, activities or development are as follows:

    (1)  (i) Shoreline Use Permits are issued and enforced in accordance with provisions of 36 CFR 327.19.

    (ii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for private structures/activities of any kind (except boats) in waters of Civil Works projects whether or not such waters are deemed navigable and where such waters are under the primary jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army and under the management of the Corps of Engineers.

    (iii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for non-floating structures on waters deemed commercially non-navigable, when such waters are under management of the Corps of Engineers.

    (iv) Shoreline Use Permits are also required for land vegetation modification activities which do not involve disruption to land form.

    (v) Permits should be issued for a term of five years. To reduce administration costs, one year permits should be issued only when the location or nature of the activity requires annual reissuance.

    (vi) Shoreline Use Permits for erosion control may be issued for the life or period of continual ownership of the structure by the permittee and his/her legal spouse.

    (2)  Dredging, construction of fixed structures, including fills and combination fixed-floating structures and the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States will be evaluated under authority of section 10, River and Harbor Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) and section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344). Permits will be issued where appropriate.

    (3)  Commercial development activities and activities which involve grading, cuts, fills, or other changes in land form, or establishment of appropriate land-based support facilities required for private floating facilities, will continue to be covered by a lease, license or other legal grant issued through the appropriate real estate element. Shoreline Management Plans should identify the types of activities that require real estate instruments and indicate the general process for obtaining same. Shoreline Use Permits are not required for facilities or activities covered by a real estate instrument.

    (g)  Shoreline Use Permits are non-transferable. They become null and void upon sale or transfer of the permitted facility or the death of the permittee and his/her legal spouse.

    (h)  Implementation of a Shoreline Management Plan shall consider existing permitted facilities and prior written Corps commitments implicit in their issuance. Facilities or activities permitted under special provisions should be identified in a way that will set them apart from other facilities or activities.

    (1) Section 6 of Pub. L. 97-140 provides that no lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures shall be required to be removed prior to December 31, 1989, from any Federal water resources reservoir or lake project administered by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, on which it was located on December 29, 1981, if such property is maintained in usable condition, and does not occasion a threat to life or property.

    (2) In accordance with section 1134(d) of Pub. L. 99-662, any houseboat, boathouse, floating cabin or lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures in place under a valid shoreline use permit as of November 17, 1986, cannot be forced to be removed from any Federal water resources project or lake administered by the Secretary of the Army on or after December 31, 1989, if it meets the three conditions below except where necessary for immediate use for public purposes or higher public use or for a navigation or flood control project.

    (i) Such property is maintained in a usable and safe condition,

    (ii) Such property does not occasion a threat to life or property, and

    (iii) The holder of the permit is in substantial compliance with the existing permit.

    (3) All such floating facilities and appurtenances will be formally recognized in an appropriate Shoreline Management Plan. New permits for these permitted facilities will be issued to new owners. If the holder of the permit fails to comply with the terms of the permit, it may be revoked and the holder required to remove the structure, in accordance with the terms of the permit as to notice, time, and appeal.

    (i)  Permitted facilities must be operated, used and maintained by the permittee in a safe, healthful condition at all times. If determined to be unsafe, the resource manager will establish together with the permittee a schedule, based on the seriousness of the safety deficiency, for correcting the deficiency or having it removed, at the permittee's expense. The applicable safety and health prescriptions in EM 385-1-1 should be used as a guide.

    (j)  The density of private floating and fixed recreation facilities will be established in the Shoreline Management Plan for all portions of Limited Development areas consistent with ecological and aesthetic characteristics and prior written commitments. The facility density in Limited Development Areas should, if feasible, be determined prior to the development of adjacent private property. The density of facilities will not be more than 50 per cent of the Limited Development Area in which they are located. Density will be measured by determining the linear feet of shoreline as compared to the width of the facilities in the water plus associated moorage arrangements which restrict the full unobstructed use of that portion of the shoreline. When a Limited Development Area or a portion of a Limited Development area reaches maximum density, notice should be given to the public and facility owners in that area that no additional facilities will be allowed. In all cases, sufficient open area will be maintained for safe maneuvering of watercraft. Docks should not extend out from the shore more than one-third of the width of a cove at normal recreation or multipurpose pool. In those cases where current density of development exceeds the density level established in the Shoreline Management Plan, the density will be reduced to the prescribed level through attrition.

    (k)  Fees associated with the Shoreline Use Permits shall be paid prior to issuing the permit in accordance with the provisions of § 327.30(c)(1). The fee schedule will be published separately.

    § 327.31   Shoreline management fee schedule.

#### § § 327.31

    A charge will be made for Shoreline Use Permits to help defray expenses associated with issuance and administration of the permits. As permits become eligible for renewal after July 1, 1976, a charge of $10 for each new permit and a $5 annual fee for inspection of floating facilities will be made. There will be no annual inspection fee for permits for vegetative modification on Shoreline areas. In all cases the total administrative charge will be collected initially at the time of permit issuance rather than on a piecemeal annual basis.

    § 328.4   Policy.

#### § § 328.4

    (a) The objective of Corps of Engineers resources management is to maximize public enjoyment and use of the lands, waters, forests, and associated recreational resources, consistent with their aesthetic and biological values. Such management includes efforts to preserve and enhance the environmental amenities that are the source of the recreational value associated with the project and to allow such other new and innovative uses of the projects that are not detrimental thereto.

    (b) Seaplane operations at water resource development projects administered by the Chief of Engineers may involve hazards including, but not limited to, conflicting recreational activities, floating debris, and underwater hazards, which may be accentuated by the normal fluctutations of water levels.

    (c) Seaplane operations may be prohibited or restricted at such water resource development projects, or portions thereof, for a variety of management reasons. Prohibiting or restricting seaplane operations in certain portions within a project in no way implies that safety hazards to seaplane operations or to other recreation users may not exist in other portions of such project.

    (d) The operation of a seaplane at Corps projects is at the risk of the plane's owner, operator, and passenger(s). The responsibility to ascertain whether seaplane operations are permitted, prohibited or restricted at such projects, and portions thereof, is incumbent upon the person(s) contemplating the use of, or using, such waters.

    § 328.5   Guidelines for seaplane use of project waters.

#### § § 328.5

    (a) All operations of the aircraft while upon the water shall be in accordance with the marine rules of the road for power boats or vessels.

    (b) Seaplanes on project waters and lands in excess of 24 hours shall be securely moored at mooring facilities and at locations permitted by the District Engineer. Seaplanes may be temporarily moored on project waters and lands, except in areas prohibited by the District Engineer, for periods less than 24 hours providing that—

    (1) The mooring is safe, secure, and accomplished so as not to damage the rights of the government or members of the public and

    § 328.6   Procedures.

#### § § 328.6

    (a) In order to protect the integrity and all authorized uses of Corps projects and the safety of all users of the lake projects, the District Engineer shall:

    (1) Examine and investigate each Corps project within his district which a seaplane operator could conceivably attempt to use for seaplane operations, and determine those projects, or portions thereof, in which seaplane operations should be prohibited.

    (2) Establish such restrictions on seaplane operations as he deems necessary or desirable in accordance with these regulations for other areas. Seaplane takeoff and landing maneuvers within specified distances of the shoreline, bridges, causeways, water utility crossings, dams, and similar structures should be prohibited.

    (3) Prior to concluding any such examination and investigation, consult with the FAA, appropriate State aeronautical agency, lessee or licensee of outgranted lands, the Coast Guard, and state boating law administrators, and use his best efforts to consult with other interested or affected public authorities and private interests for their guidance, particularly for those projects which are regularly used by the public for recreational purposes or are located in the vicinity of actively used airports, air fields, or densely populated areas. News releases, public notice, and congressional liaison should be used. Public hearings are encouraged.

    (4) In making his investigation, examination, and determination, consider environmental factors in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. 91-190—particularly should he consider the impact that seaplane operations may have on the safety at the project, aquatic, fish and wildlife, noise levels, recreation, and air and water quality. Prior to concluding such investigation and examination, he shall prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and, if necessary, an environmental impact statement (EIS) assessing the environmental impacts of permitting seaplanes to operate at the projects, or portions thereof, in his district.

    (5) Place on Corps maps, brochures and otherwise adequately apprise the public and interested agencies of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. Each map, brochure, or other notice should clearly indicate that operation of a seaplane at Corps projects is at the risk of the plane's owner, operator, and/or passenger(s).

    (6) Notify the FAA by letter of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. The letter should use the words “seaplane operations prohibited,” or “seaplane operations restricted,” describe the geographical location of such areas as precisely as possible, describe any restrictions, include a telephone number for FAA to contact the District, and be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration, Area Traffic Service, Flight Services Division (AAT-432), 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591.

    (b) The removal of the present prohibition on seaplane operations will be effective one year from the date of publication of these regulations. The District Engineer should complete the examination, investigation, determination and notification to the FAA of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted, within one year from the date of this regulation. The District Engineer may extend the present prohibition for up to one additional year if he cannot complete his examination, investigation, determination, and notification within one year. In such event, he should notify the FAA by letter and publish other appropriate notices. Any further extension of time will require the approval of the Chief of Engineers.

    (c) After he has completed his examination, investigation, determination and notification of the FAA of projects, or portions thereof where seaplane operations will be prohibited or restricted, The District Engineer should periodically reevaluate his determination as additional operational data becomes available. He may modify, delete, or add projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. Except where immediate action is required, he should consult with appropriate public authorities and private interests for their guidance with regard to such actions. Notification of these actions shall be forwarded to the FAA as indicated in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

    § 330.5   Policy.

#### § § 330.5

    (a) It is the policy of the Corps of Engineers to provide, to the extent of its authorities, a safe and healthful environment for public use of lands and waters at Civil Works water resource development projects. To insure this safe and healthful environment, and to augment the citation authorities granted to the Corps of Engineers by reference § 330.3(b), District Engineers, subject to the authority of the Division Engineers, as set out below, are hereby delegated the authority to contract with States or their political subdivisions to obtain increased law enforcement services at Civil Works water resource development projects. Division Engineers are hereby delegated the authority to approve any minor deviations from this regulation except that any substantial deviations from the policies expressed within this regulation will require the prior approval of the Chief of Engineers or his authorized representative. Any required approval for deviation shall be made prior to the execution of the contract. When fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1979 work allowances are issued, instructions will be furnished on reporting requirements and the control of expenditures.

    (b) Contracts for law enforcement services, as authorized in § 330.5(a), shall be subject to the terms and conditions as provided for within this regulation and in accordance with standard contracting and accounting procedures applicable to the Corps of Engineers.

    (c) This regulation is not intended to diminish or otherwise limit the existing law enforcement responsibilities of the State or local law enforcement agencies.

    (d) Contract law enforcement personnel shall not be given Federal citation authority for enforcement of regulations contained in title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter III nor shall they be empowered to enforce such regulations. These regulations shall remain the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers.

    (e) Contracts for increased law enforcement shall be for those projects or portions of projects that are operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers. Law enforcement services will not be provided under this program to those outgrant areas operated and maintained by a non-Federal sponsor.

    § 330.6   Criteria.

#### § § 330.6

    (a) In order to provide reimbursement for law enforcement services supplied by a State or local law enforcement agency, a contract must be executed and approved in accordance with this regulation prior to the provisions of such services.

    (b) The authorized contract law enforcement program extends only to 30 September 1979. Law enforcement services acquired by contract under this program shall be limited to those increased law enforcement services required to meet the needs of the public during peak visitation periods. Accordingly, the contract period shall not extend beyond the dates of 1 April through 30 September inclusive, and in no event shall the contract be written for more than 120 days within that time period. The contract may provide for an option to renew for a similar, additional period not to exceed 120-day period in Fiscal Year 1979. Any exceptions to this criteria must be approved by the Chief of Engineers or his authorized representative.

    (c) Contracts shall be consummated only with those public law enforcement agencies legally empowered to enforce State and local criminal and civil laws within their respective political jurisdictions. In light of this requirement and the authority cited in § 330.3(c), it is recognized that sole source negotiations may necessarily be utilized in the procurement of these services. In negotiating law enforcement contracts with these agencies the District Engineer must determine the reasonableness of the price for the law enforcement services offered under the contract. Such a determination shall be made prior to execution of the contract, in accordance with the applicable Contract Cost Principles and Procedures as set out in ASPR, section 15, part 7, and as subject to the policies contained in this regulation. Such a determination shall be contained in the official contract file and must accompany any requests for deviations from the Division Engineer or Chief of Engineers as provided for in § 330.5(a) of this regulation. Contract law enforcement personnel must meet all the qualifications, including minimal law enforcement training, required by State and local laws and regulations.

    (d) The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment and supplies which are required to provide the increased law enforcement services contracted for by the District Engineer. The Corps of Engineers shall not reimburse the contractor for the purchase of any equipment or supplies desired by the contractor for use under this program. However, the Corps of Engineers shall reimburse the contractor for the reasonable costs incurred by him in the rental or use of such equipment which is allocated to the work performed by him under the contract. Such use shall include:

    (1) A depreciation or use allowance for such equipment as determined by the service life evaluation system used by the contractor, and (2) the costs of necessary maintenance, repair, and upkeep of the property which neither adds to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolongs its intended life, but keeps it at an efficient operating condition.

    (e) Reimbursement for law enforcement services shall be considered only for increased law enforcement services to meet needs during peak visitation periods. Each District Engineer shall evaluate and establish a normal law enforcement service standard for each contract situation and include such standard in the plan of operation to be developed in accordance with § 330.6(h). Each District Engineer shall evaluate the existing law enforcement services now being provided by State or local law enforcement agencies at those water resources projects or recreation areas where it is anticipated that law enforcement service contracts may be executed, and determine the scope including the type and amount, of law enforcement service which exceeds the normal law enforcement standard, and which will become eligible for reimbursement under the contract. Normally, requests by the District Engineer or his authorized representative for emergency or unanticipated law enforcement assistance will be considered nonreimbursable. Increased law enforcement services, eligible for reimbursement under the terms of the contract, shall be those regularly scheduled patrols or surveillance in excess of the normal law enforcement standard presently being provided by the contractor.

    (f) An appropriate orientation program will be given by Corps personnel to all contract law enforcement personnel assigned to Corps projects. The purpose of this orientation will be to familiarize the contract law enforcement personnel with the policies and procedures of the Corps of Engineers, and to familiarize Corps personnel with the functions and duties of the State or local law enforcement agency. The Corps of Engineers shall reimburse the contractor for the cost per man hour as set out in § 330.6(h)(4) for attending the orientation program.

    (g) The contractor shall be required to keep a record of the services provided to the District under the terms and conditions of the contract in accordance with the criteria established in the plan of operation required in § 330.6(h).

    (h) The District Engineer, in cooperation with the Contractor, shall prepare a Plan of Operation for the Provision of law enforcement services as an attachment to the contract. The Plan of Operation shall contain, but not necessarily be limited to, the following information:

    (1) Identify, by name and location, the project or projects and specific areas (recreation and others) that require law enforcement services.

    (2) Describe the normal law enforcement services to be provided by the Contractor without reimbursement by the Government (see § 330.6(e)). Identify time of day, number of hours-per-day number of days-per-week, and the number of patrols.

    (3) Describe the increased law enforcement services to be provided by the Contractor under the contract. Identify the time-of-day, number of hours-per-day, number of days-per-week, number of patrols, manpower per patrol, and effective starting and ending dates.

    (4) Identify the cost-per-man-hour for the provision of reimbursable law enforcement services, and identify the costs for utilization and operation, maintenance and repair of such equipment as allocated for use under the contract. (See § 330.6(d).)

    (5) The District Engineer and the Contractor should designate specific individuals to issue or receive requests for reimbursable law enforcement services under the contract.

    (6) Describe the billing procedures to be utilized for the increased law enforcement services. The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, the total charges, the number of hours involved, and starting and ending dates of the billing period.

    (7) The Contractor shall prepare a Daily Law Enforcement Log (see § 330.6(g) for the law enforcement services rendered as specified in § 330.6(h)(3)). These logs shall be compiled by the Contractor and submitted to the District Engineer or his designated representative on a regular basis throughout the life of the contract. It is intended by this reporting requirement to minimize the paperwork burden on behalf of the Contractor while, at the same time, providing assurance to the Government with an adequate information base on which to administer the law enforcement services being provided under the contract. Any requirement for additional information to be contained in these reports due to unique or special circumstances encountered in negotiating a Plan of Operation with a particular law enforcement jurisdiction must receive the prior approval of the Division Engineer.

    § 330.7   Funding.

#### § § 330.7

    (a) Section 330.3(c) sets forth the maximum authorized funds for law enforcement contracting in FY 1978 and FY 1979. The Division funding levels for FY 1978 are based on information as previously submitted.

    (b) The FY 1979 funding request for law enforcement contracting will be submitted as part of the FY 1979 budget submittal.
