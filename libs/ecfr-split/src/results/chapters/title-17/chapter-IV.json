Total haircuts is the risk measure used in the ratio; it is made up of measures of market risk and measures of credit risk. The market risk of a government securities broker's or dealer's positions is accounted for through the Treasury market risk haircut and the other securities haircut. Credit risk is accounted for in the counterparty exposure, concentration of credit, and credit volatility haircuts and in the computation of liquid capital through the various deductions and charges. \n",
