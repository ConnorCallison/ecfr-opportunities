#### § § 800.17

        (a)  Subject to the provisions of § 800.18, sacked export grain shall be (1) officially inspected on the basis of official samples obtained with an approved sampling device and operated in accordance with instructions, (2) Class X weighed or checkweighed, and (3) officially checkloaded by official personnel at the time the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  When official sampling, official inspection, Class X weighing or checkweighing, and checkloading of sacked export grain loaded aboard an export carrier is performed at one location and time, official export inspection and weight certificate(s) which identify the export carrier shall be issued.

        (c)  When official sampling, official inspection, and Class X weighing or checkweighing of sacked export grain is performed prior to the date of loading aboard an export carrier, official “OUT” certificates shall be issued. An examination by official personnel for condition and checkloading of the grain shall be made as the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier. If the examination for condition and the checkloading shows that the identity or quantity of the grain has not changed or the condition of the grain has not changed beyond expected variations prescribed in the instruction, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on the basis of the official “OUT” certificates and the checkloading. If the identity, quantity, or the condition has changed, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on the basis of the most representative samples, including weight samples, obtained at the time the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier.

        § 800.18   Waivers of the official inspection and Class X weighing requirements.

#### § § 800.18

        (a)  Waivers from the official inspection and Class X weighing requirements for export grain under section 5 of the Act shall be provided in accordance with this section and the Act.

Exporters and elevator operators who are granted a waiver by reason of this paragraph shall, as a condition of the waiver, keep such accounts, records, and memorandum to fully and correctly disclose all transactions concerning lots of all export grain shipments. In addition, the exporters or elevator operators shall notify the Service in writing of the intention to export grain under this waiver. In the case of lots waived under this provision, if such lots are required by contract to be inspected or weighed, or if the lots are represented by official inspection or weight certificates, then such certificates shall meet the requirements of section 5 of the Act.

        (2)  Official inspection and Class X weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported for seeding purposes, provided that (i) the grain is (A) sold or consigned for sale and invoiced as seed; and (B) identified as seed for seeding purposes on the Shipper's Export Declaration; and (ii) records pertaining to these shipments are made available, upon request by the Service, for review or copying purposes.

        (3)  Official inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to grain that is shipped from a foreign country to a foreign country through the United States in bond in accordance with applicable regulations of the United States Customs Service (19 CFR part 18).

        (4)  Inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported by rail or truck from the United States to Canada or Mexico.

        (5)  Official inspection requirements may be waived by the Service on a shipment-by-shipment basis for export grain not sold, offered for sale, or consigned for sale by official grade if (i) the contract and any amendments clearly show that the buyer and seller mutually agree to ship the grain without official inspection and (ii) a copy of the contract and any amendments is furnished in advance of loading, along with a completed application on a form prescribed by the Service.

        (6)  Upon request, any required official inspection or Class X weighing of grain may be waived on a shipment-by-shipment basis if (i) official personnel are not and will not be available within a 24-hour period to perform needed inspection or weighing services and (ii) both the buyer and seller of the grain are made aware that the grain has not been officially inspected or Class X weighed.

        (7)  (i) Upon request, the requirements for official inspection or Class X weighing will be waived whenever the Service determines that an emergency exists that precludes official inspection or Class X weighing;

        (ii) To qualify for an emergency waiver, the exporter or elevator operator must submit a timely written request to the Service for the emergency waiver and also comply with all conditions that the Service may require.

        (8)  Official inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to high quality specialty grain exported in containers. Records generated during the normal course of business that pertain to these shipments must be made available to the Service upon request, for review or copying. These records must be maintained for a period of 3 years.

        (12)  Owners and operators of elevators shall, upon a finding of need by the Administrator, provide equipment necessary for the monitoring by official personnel of grain loading, unloading, handling, sampling, weighing, inspection, and related activities. The finding of need will be based primarily on a consideration of manpower and efficiency.

        (c) —(1)  Weighing services shall be provided only at weighing facilities which have met the conditions, duties, and responsibilities specified in section 7A(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. Weighing services will be available only in accordance with the requirements of § 800.115. Facilities desiring weighing services should contact the Service in advance to allow the Service time to determine if the facility complies with the provisions of the Act and regulations.

        (D) Complete operating instructions; and

        (vii) Any other information deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act.

        (3) —(i)  Upon request, each weighing facility shall permit official weighing services to be performed promptly.

        (ii)  Each weighing facility shall supervise its employees and shall take action necessary to assure that employees are performing their duties according to the Act, regulations, and instructions and are not performing prohibited functions or are not involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, and instructions.

        (iii) —(A)  Each weighing facility shall obtain and maintain facilities and equipment which the Service determines are needed for weighing services performed at the facility. Each facility shall operate and shall maintain each scale system and related grain handling system used in weighing according to instructions issued by the manufacturer and by the Service. A scale log book for each approved scale used for official weighing services shall be maintained according to instructions at each weighing facility.

        (B)  Scales or scale systems that are operating in other than a correct and approved manner shall not be used for weighing grain under the Act. Before the malfunctioning scale or scale system can be used again for weighing grain under the Act, it shall be repaired and determined to be operating properly by the Service or approved scale testing and certification organization.

        (iv)  FGIS oral directives issued to elevator personnel shall be confirmed in writing upon request by elevator management. Whenever practicable, the Service shall issue oral directives through elevator management officials.

#### § § 800.50

        (a)  Any or all services available to an applicant under the Act may be refused, either temporarily or indefinitely, by the Service for causes prescribed in section 10(a) of the Act. Such refusal by the Service may be restricted to the particular facility or applicant (if not a facility) found in violation or to a particular type of service, as the facts may warrant. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties or other remedial action authorized by the Act.

        (b)  The Service may, without first affording the applicant (hereafter in this section “respondent”) a hearing, refuse to provide official inspection and Class X or Y weighing services pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause, as prescribed in section 10 of the Act, for refusing such official services and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official services system under the Act:  within 7 days after refusal of such service, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the temporary refusal if alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the respondent.

        (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before the Service refuses to provide official services the respondent shall be (1) notified of the services that are to be refused, the locations at which and the time period for which service will be refused, and the reasons for the refusal; and (2) afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR 1.130 ). At the discretion of the Service, prior to initiation of formal adjudicatory proceedings, the respondent may be given an opportunity to express his or her views on the action proposed by the Service in an informal conference before the Administrator of the Service. If, as a result of such an informal conference, the Service and the respondent enter into a consent agreement, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.

        (d)  Any person who has knowingly committed any violation of section 13 of the Act or has been convicted of any violation of other Federal law with respect to the handling, weighing, or official inspection of grain may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed the amount specified at § 3.91(b)(6)(viii) of this title for each such violation as the Administrator determines is appropriate to effect compliance with the Act. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties under section 14 of the Act, or in addition to, or in lieu of, the refusal of official services authorized by the Act.

        (e)  Before a civil penalty is assessed against any person, such person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (f)  Upon failure to pay the civil penalty, the Service may request the Attorney General to file civil action to collect the penalty in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

#### § § 800.52

        Subject to the provisions of §§ 800.48, 800.49, and 800.50, no person entitled to official services under the Act shall be denied or deprived of the right thereto by reason of any rule, regulation, bylaw, or custom of any market, board of trade, chamber of commerce, exchange, inspection department, or similar organization; or by any contract, agreement, or other understanding.

      Descriptions

        § 800.55   Descriptions by grade.

#### § § 800.55

        (a)  In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale, which involves the shipment of grain in interstate or foreign commerce, the description of grain, as being of a grade in any advertising, price quotation, other negotiation of sale, contract of sale, invoice, bill of lading, other document, or description on bags or other containers of the grain, is prohibited if such description is other than by an official grade designation, with or without additional information as to specified factors. An official grade designation contains any of the following: The term “U.S.,” the numerals 1 through 5, the term “Sample grade,” or the name of a subclass or a special grade of grain specified in the Official United States Standards for Grain.

        (b)  A description of grain by a proprietary brand name or a trademark that does not resemble an official grade designation will not be considered to be a description by grade; but a description by a proprietary brand name or trademark that contains singly or in combination any of the terms referenced in paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to resemble an official grade designation.

        (c)  In interstate commerce, a description of grain by the use of one or more grade factor designations which appear in the Official United States Standards for Grain or by other criteria will not be considered to be a description by grade.

        (d)  In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale of any grain which involves the shipment of grain from the United States to any place outside thereof, knowingly using a false or misleading description of grain by official grade designation, or other description is prohibited.

        § 800.56   Requirements on descriptions.

#### § § 800.56

        Section 13 of the Act contains certain prohibitions with respect to the use of official grade designations, official marks, and other representations with respect to grain.

        (a) The use of an official grade designation, with or without factor information, or of official criteria information, or of the term “official grain standards,” shall not, without additional information, be considered to be a representation that the grain was officially inspected.

        (b) The use of any symbol or term listed as an official mark, at § 800.0(b)(68), with respect to grain shall be considered to be a representation of official service under the Act: Provided however, that the use of the official marks “official certificate;” “officially inspected;” “official inspection;” “officially weighed;” “official weight;” and “official weighing” shall not be considered to be a representation of official service under the Act if it is clearly shown that the activity occurred under the U.S. Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 241 ): Provided further, that the use of the official mark “officially tested” with respect to grain inspection and weighing equipment shall not be considered to be a representation of testing under the Act if it is clearly shown that the equipment was tested under a State statute.

      Grain Handling Practices

        § 800.60   Deceptive actions and practices.

#### § § 800.60

        In the absence of prior adequate notice to appropriate official personnel, any action or practice, including the loading, weighing, handling, or sampling of grain that knowingly causes or is an attempt to cause the issuance by official personnel of a false or incorrect official certificate or other official form, is deemed to be deceptive and, as such, is a violation of section 13(a)(3) of the Act. For the purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice is written or oral notice given to an agency or the Service, as applicable, before official personnel begin to perform official inspection or weighing services. If oral notice is given, it must be confirmed in writing within 2 business days. To be adequate, the notice must explain the nature and extent of the action or practice in question and must identify the grain, stowage container, equipment, facility, and the official personnel actually or potentially involved.

        § 800.61   Prohibited grain handling practices.

#### § § 800.61

        (a)  For the purpose of this section, dockage and foreign material in grain shall be:

        (1) Defined for export elevators at export port locations as set forth in 7 CFR part 810 and as dust removed from grain and collected in a bin/container and as dust settling on floors, equipment, and other areas, commonly referred to as dust sweepings; and

        (2) Defined for other than export elevators as set forth in 7 CFR part 810.

        (b)  Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, no person shall:

        (1) Recombine or add dockage or foreign material to any grain, or

        (2) Blend different kinds of grain except when such blending will result in grain being designated as Mixed grain in accordance with subpart E of the Official United States Standards for Grain.

        (3) Add water to grain for purposes other than milling, malting, or similar processing operations.

        (c)  (1) The Administrator may grant exemptions from paragraph (b) of this section for grain shipments sent directly to a domestic end-user or processor. Requests for exemptions shall be submitted by grain handlers to the Service through the domestic end-users or processors or their representatives.

        (2) Grain sold under an exemption shall be consumed or processed into a product(s) by the purchaser and not resold into the grain market.

        (3) Products or byproducts from grain sold under an exemption shall not be blended with or added to grain in commercial channels, except for vegetable oil which may be used as a dust suppressant in accordance with (d)(4) of this section.

        (d)  Paragraph (b) shall not be construed as prohibiting the following grain handling practices. Compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section does not excuse compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws.

        (1)  Grain of the same kind, as defined by the Official United States Standards for Grain, may be blended to adjust quality. Broken corn or broken kernels may be recombined or added to whole grain of the same kind provided that no foreign material or dockage has been added to the broken corn or broken kernels.

        (2)  Grain may be treated to control insects and fungi. Elevators, other grain handlers, and their agents are responsible for the proper use and applications of insecticides and fungicides. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements for grain that is officially inspected and weighed.

        (3)  Dockage and foreign material may be marketed separately.

        (4)  Grain may be treated with an additive, other than water, to suppress dust during handling. Elevators, other grain handlers, and their agents are responsible for the proper use and application of dust suppressants. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements for grain that is officially inspected and weighed.

        (5)  Confetti or similar material may be added to grain for identification purposes. Elevators, other grain handlers, and their agents are responsible for the proper use and application of such materials. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements for grain that is officially inspected or weighed.

        (6)  Between May 1, 1987, and December 31, 1987, export elevators at export port locations may recombine dockage and foreign material, but not dust, with grain provided such recombination occurs during the loading of a vessel with the intended purpose of ensuring uniformity of dockage and foreign material in the cargo.

      Fees

        § 800.70   Fees for official services performed by agencies.

#### § § 800.70

        (a)  (1) Fees assessed by an agency for official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing services or testing of inspection equipment shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory.

        (2) In the case of a State or local governmental agency, fees shall not be used for any purpose other than to finance the cost of the official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing service and inspection equipment testing service performed by the agency or the cost of other closely related programs administered by the agency.

        (b) —(1)  Only fees that meet the requirements stated in this section and are approved by the Service as reasonable and nondiscriminatory may be charged by an agency.

        (2)  For good cause shown by an agency, the Administrator may grant case-by-case exceptions to the requirements in this section, provided that a determination is made that the agency fees would be reasonable and nondiscriminatory.

        (c)  In determining if an agency's fees are reasonable, the Service will consider whether the fees:

        (1) Cover the estimated total cost to the agency of

        (i) Official inspection services,

        (ii) Class X or Class Y weighing services,

        (iii) Inspection equipment testing services, and

        (iv) Related supervision and monitoring activities performed by the agency;

        (2) Are reasonably consistent with fees assessed by adjacent agencies for similar services;

        (3) Are assessed on the basis of the average cost of performing the same or similar services at all locations served by the agency; and

        (4) Are supported by sufficient information which shows how the fees were developed.

        (d)  In determining if fees are nondiscriminatory, the Service will consider whether the fees are collected from all applicants for official service in accordance with the approved fee schedule. Charges for time and travel incurred in providing service at a location away from a specified service point shall be assessed in accordance with the approved fee schedule.

        (e)  (1) Each agency shall establish a schedule of fees for official services which the agency is delegated or designated the authority to perform. The schedule shall be in a standard format in accordance with the instructions. Such schedules may include fees for nonofficial services provided by the agency, but they shall be clearly identified and will not be subject to approval by the Service.

        (2) The schedule shall be published and made available by the agency to all users of its services.

        (f) —(1)  A request for approval of a new or revised fee shall be submitted to the Service not less than 60 days in advance of the proposed effective date for the fee. Failure to submit a request within the prescribed time period may be considered grounds for postponment or denial of the request.

        (2)  Each request shall show (i) the present fee, if any, and the proposed fee, together with data showing in detail how the fee was developed, and (ii) the proposed effective date.

        (g) —(1)  If upon review the Service finds that the request and supporting data justify the new or revised fee, the request will be marked “approved” and returned to the agency.

        (2)  If the Service finds that the request and supporting data do not justify the new or revised fee, approval of the request will be withheld pending receipt of any additional supporting data which the agency has to offer. If the data are not submitted within a reasonable period, the request shall be denied. In the case of a denial of a request, the agency shall be notified of the reason for denial.

        § 800.71   Fees assessed by the Service.

#### § § 800.71

        (a)  The fees shown in Schedule A of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to official inspection and weighing services performed by FGIS in the U.S. and Canada. The fees shown in Schedule B of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to official domestic inspection and weighing services performed by delegated States and designated agencies, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico. The fees charged to delegated States by the Service are set forth in the State's Delegation of Authority document. Failure of a delegated State or designated agency to pay the appropriate fees to the Service within 30 days after becoming due will result in an automatic termination of the delegation or designation. The delegation or designation may be reinstated by the Service if fees that are due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days of the termination.

        (1)  For each calendar year, FGIS will calculate  fees as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. FGIS will publish a notice in the  and post  fees on the Agency's public website.

        (2)  The Service will assess a supervision fee per metric ton of domestic U.S. grain shipments inspected or weighed, or both, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico. For each calendar year, the Service will calculate Schedule B fees as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The Service will publish a notice in the  and post Schedule B fees on the Agency's public website.

        (b)  For each calendar year, starting with 2021, the Service will review fees included in this section and publish fees each year according to the following:

        (1)  Tonnage fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will consist of the national tonnage fee and local tonnage fees and the Service will calculate and round the fee to the nearest $0.001 per metric ton. All outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Offices in New Orleans, League City, Portland, and Toledo will be assessed the national tonnage fee plus the appropriate local tonnage fee. Export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and official agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, will be assessed the national tonnage fee only. The fees will be set according to the following:

        (i)  The national tonnage fee is the national program administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and designated agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, and outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Service during the previous 5 fiscal years.

        (ii)  The local tonnage fee is the Field Office administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Office during the previous 5 fiscal years. The local tonnage fee is calculated individually for each Field Office.

        (2)  Supervision fee in Schedule B in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be set according to the following:

        (i)  The operating reserve adjustment is the supervision program costs for the previous fiscal year divided by 2 less the end of previous fiscal year operating reserve balance.

        (ii)  The supervision tonnage fee is the sum of the prior fiscal year program costs plus operating reserve adjustment divided by the average yearly tons of domestic U.S. grain shipments inspected or weighed, or both, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico during the previous 5 fiscal years. If the calculated value is zero or a negative value, the Service will suspend the collection of supervision tonnage fees for one calendar year.

        (3)  In order to maintain an operating reserve not less than 3 and not more than 6 months, the Service will review the value of the operating reserve at the end of each fiscal year and adjust fees according to the following:

        (i)  If the operating reserve is less than 4.5 times the monthly operating expenses, the Service will increase all fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 2 percent for each $1,000,000, rounded down, that the operating reserve is less than 4.5 times the monthly operating expense, with a maximum increase of 5 percent annually. Except for fees based on tonnage or hundredweight, all fees will be rounded to the nearest $0.10.

        (ii)  If the operating reserve is greater than 4.5 times the monthly operating expenses, the Service will decrease all fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 2 percent for each $1,000,000, rounded down, that the operating reserve is greater than 4.5 times the monthly operating expense, with a maximum decrease of 5 percent annually. Except for fees based on tonnage or hundredweight, all fees will be rounded to the nearest $0.10.

        (c)  The Service will periodically review and adjust all fees in Schedules A and B in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, respectively, as necessary to ensure they reflect the true cost of providing and supervising official service. This process will incorporate any fee adjustments from paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d)  For each calendar year, the Service will review fees included in this section and publish fees in the  and on the Agency's public website.

        (1)  The fee for registration certificates and renewals will be published annually in the  and on the Agency's public website, and the Service will calculate the fee using the noncontract hourly rate published pursuant to 7 CFR 800.71(a)(1) multiplied by five. If you operate a business that buys, handles, weighs, or transports grain for sale in foreign commerce, or you are also in a control relationship with respect to a business that buys, handles, weighs, or transports grain for sale in interstate commerce, you must complete an application and pay the published fee.

        (2)  The fee for amending designations will be published annually in the  and on the Agency's public website. The Service will calculate the fee using the cost of publication plus one hour at the noncontract hourly rate. If you submit an application to amend a designation, you must pay the published fee.

#### § § 800.72

        (a) When transportation of the service representative to the service location (at other than a specified duty point) is more than 25 miles from an FGIS office, the actual transportation cost in addition to the applicable hourly rate for each service representative will be assessed from the FGIS office to the service point and return. When commercial modes of transportation (e.g., airplanes) are required, the actual expense incurred for the round-trip travel will be assessed. When services are provided to more than one applicant, the travel and other related charges will be prorated between applicants.

        (b) In addition to a 2-hour minimum charge for service on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, an additional charge will be assessed when the revenue from the services in § 800.71(a)(1), schedule A, table 2, does not equal or exceed what would have been collected at the applicable hourly rate. The additional charge will be the difference between the actual unit fee revenue and the hourly fee revenue. Hours accrued for travel and standby time shall apply in determining the hours for the minimum fee.

      Inspection Methods and Procedures

        § 800.80   Methods and order of performing official inspection services.

#### § § 800.80

        (a) —(1)  All official inspection services shall be performed in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed in the regulations and the instructions.

        (2)  A lot inspection service shall be based on a representative sampling and examination of the grain in the entire lot, except as provided in § 800.85, and an accurate analysis of the grain in the sample.

        (3)  A stowage examination service shall be based on a thorough and accurate examination of the carrier or container into which grain will be loaded.

        (4)  A submitted sample inspection service shall be based on a submitted sample of sufficient size to enable official personnel to perform a complete analysis for grade. If a complete analysis for grade cannot be performed because of an inadequate sample size or other conditions, the request for service shall be dismissed or a factor only inspection may be performed upon request.

        (5)  A reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection service shall be based on an independent review of official grade information, official factor information, or other information consistent with the scope of the original inspection.

        (b)  Official inspection services shall be performed, to the extent practicable, in the order in which they are received. Priority shall be given to inspections required for export grain. Priority may be given to other kinds of inspection services under the Act with the specific approval of the Service.

        (c)  Each document submitted by or on behalf of an applicant for inspection services shall be promptly stamped or similarly marked by official personnel to show the date of receipt.

        (d)  No official personnel shall perform or participate in performing an official inspection service on grain or on a carrier or container in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest.

        § 800.81   Sample requirements; general.

#### § § 800.81

        (a) —(1)  For original sample-lot inspection purposes, an official sample shall be obtained by official personnel; representative of the grain in the lot; and protected from manipulation, substitution, and improper or careless handling.

        (2)  For an official sample-lot reinspection service or an official appeal sample-lot inspection service, the sample(s) on which the reinspection or appeal is determined shall (i) be obtained by official personnel and (ii) otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the reinspection or appeal inspection is determined on the basis of official file sample(s), the samples shall meet the requirements of § 800.82(d).

        (3)  Upon request and if practicable, a new sample shall be obtained and examined as a part of a reinspection or appeal inspection. The provision for a new sample shall not apply if obtaining the new sample involves a change in method of sampling.

        (b)  A sample shall not be considered representative unless it (1) has been obtained by official personnel, (2) is of the size prescribed in the instructions, and (3) has been obtained, handled, and submitted in accordance with the instructions. A sample which fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph may, upon request of the applicant, be inspected as a submitted sample.

        (c)  Official personnel shall protect official samples, warehouseman's samples, and submitted samples from manipulation, substitution, or improper and careless handling which may deprive the samples of their representativeness or which may change the physical or chemical properties of the grain, as appropriate, from the time of sampling or receipt until the inspection services are completed and the file samples have been discarded.

        (d)  Official personnel shall not perform an original inspection or a reinspection service on an official sample or a warehouseman's sample unless the grain from which the sample was obtained was located within the area of responsibility assigned to the agency or field office at the time of sampling, except as provided for in § 800.117, or on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator.

        (e) —(1)  Any grain in excess of the quantity specified in the instructions for the requested service, the file samples, and samples requested by interested persons shall be returned to the lot from which the grain was obtained or to the owner of the lot or the owner's order.

        (2)  Inspection samples, after they have served their intended purpose, shall be disposed of as follows:

        (i) Samples which contain toxic substances or materials shall be kept out of food and feed channels, and

        (ii) Official personnel shall dispose of samples obtained or submitted to them according to procedures established by the Service. Complete and accurate records of disposition shall be maintained.

        § 800.82   Sampling provisions by level of service.

#### § § 800.82

        (a) —(1)  Each original inspection service shall be performed on the basis of one or more official samples obtained by official personnel from grain in the lot and forwarded to the appropriate agency or field office.

        (2)  Each original warehouseman's sample-lot inspection service shall be performed on the basis of samples obtained by a licensed warehouseman and sent to the appropriate agency or field office in whose circuit the warehouse is located.

        (3)  Each original submitted sample inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the sample as submitted.

        (b) —(1)  Each of these inspection services shall be performed on the basis of official samples as available, including file samples, at the time the service is requested. In performing these services, a sample obtained with an approved diverter-type mechanical sampler or with a pelican sampler generally shall be used with respect to quality factors and official criteria, and a sample obtained with a probe at the time of the reinspection or appeal, generally, shall be used with respect to heating, musty, sour, insect infestation, and other condition and odor factors. In instances where original inspection results are based on samples obtained by probe, the decision as to whether file samples or new samples obtained by probe are to be used shall be made by the official personnel performing the service.

        (2)  Each reinspection service and appeal inspection service on a warehouseman's sample shall be performed on an analysis of the official file sample.

        (3)  Each reinspection service and appeal inspection service on a submitted sample shall be performed on an analysis of the official file sample.

        (c)  Board appeal inspection services shall be performed on an analysis of the official file sample.

        (d) —(1)  A file sample that is retained by official personnel in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the instructions may be considered representative for a reinspection service, appeal inspection service, and a Board appeal inspection service if (i) the file sample has remained at all times in the custody and control of the official personnel that performed the inspection service in question; and (ii) the official personnel who performed the original inspection service and those who are to perform the reinspection, the appeal inspection, or the Board appeal inspection service determine that the samples were representative at the time the original inspection service was performed and that the quality or condition of the grain in the samples has not changed.

        (2)  When the results of a reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection service are based on an official file sample, the certificate for the reinspection service, the appeal inspection service, and the Board appeal inspection service shall show a statement, as specified in the instructions, indicating that the results are based on the official file sample.

        § 800.83   Sampling provisions by kind of movement.

#### § § 800.83

        (a) —(1)  Except as may be approved by the Administrator on a shipment-by-shipment basis in an emergency, each inspection for official grade, official factor, or official criteria on an export cargo shipment of bulk grain shall be performed on official samples obtained from the grain (i) as the grain is being loaded aboard the final carrier; (ii) after the final elevation of the grain prior to loading and as near to the final loading spout as is physically practicable (except as approved by the Administrator when representative samples can be obtained before the grain reaches the final loading spout); and (iii) by means of a diverter-type mechanical sampler approved by the Service and operated in accordance with instructions. If an approved diverter-type mechanical sampler is not properly installed at an elevator or facility as required, each certificate issued at that elevator or facility for an export cargo shipment of bulk grain shall show a statement indicating the type of approved sampling method used, as prescribed in the instructions.

        (2)  Each inspection for official grade, official factor, or official criteria on an export cargo shipment of sacked grain shall be performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any sampling method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with instructions.

        (b)  Each inspection for official grade, official factor, or official criteria on a domestic cargo movement (“In,” “Out,” or en route barge movement), a movement in a land carrier (any movement in a railcar, truck trailer, truck/trailer combination, or container), or a “LOCAL” movement of bulk or sacked grain shall be performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any sampling method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with the instructions.

        § 800.84   Inspection of grain in land carriers, containers, and barges in single lots.

#### § § 800.84

        (a)  The inspection of bulk or sacked grain loaded or unloaded from any carrier or container, except shiplot grain, must be conducted in accordance with the provision in this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions. Applicant must provide written instructions to official personnel, reflecting contract requirements for quality and quantity for the inspection of multiple carriers graded on a composite grade or average grade basis.

        (b) —(1)  When grain in a carrier(s) is/are offered for inspection as one lot and the grain is found to be uniform in condition, the grain must be sampled, inspected, graded, and certified as one lot. For the purpose of this paragraph, condition only includes the factors heating and odor.

        (i)  Grain loaded in multiple carriers offered for inspection may be combined into a single sample for grade analysis and certified as a single lot,  the grain in each individual carrier is inspected and found uniform in respect to odor, condition, and insect infestation, and sampling is performed at the individual loading location in a reasonably continuous operation. The maximum number of individual units that may be combined to form a composite grade analysis is 20 containers, 5 railcars, or 15 trucks. Composite analysis must be restricted to carriers inspected within the official service provider's area of responsibility.

        (ii)  Grain loaded in multiple carriers offered for inspection may be graded individually, then averaged for certification as a single lot,  the grain in each individual carrier is inspected and graded as an individual unit; the grain is found to be uniform in respect to odor, condition, and insect infestation; and sampling is performed at the individual loading location in a reasonably continuous operation. The maximum number of individual units that may be combined to form an average grade analysis is 20 containers, 5 railcars, or 15 trucks. Average grade analysis is restricted to carriers inspected within the official service provider's area of responsibility.

        (2)  When grain in a carrier is offered for inspection as one lot and the grain is found to be not uniform in condition because portions of the grain are heating or have an odor, the grain in each portion will be sampled, inspected, and graded separately; but the results must be shown on one certificate. The certificate must show the approximate quantity or weight of each portion, the location of each portion in the carrier or container, and the grade of the grain in each portion. The requirements of this section are not applicable when an applicant requests that the grade of the entire carrier be based on a determination of heating or odor when only a portion of the carrier is found to be heating or have an odor.

        (3)  If any portion of grain in a lot is found to be infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for Grain, the entire lot shall be considered infested. When grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant for inspection shall be promptly notified and given the option of (i) receiving a grade certificate with a special grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (ii) fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.

        (c)  Except as provided in this paragraph, one official certificate must be issued for the inspection of the grain in each truck, trailer, truck/trailer(s) combination, container, railcar, barge, or similarly-sized carrier, or composite/average grade analysis on multiple carrier units. The requirements of this paragraph are not applicable:

        (1) When grain is inspected in a combined lot under § 800.85;

        (2) When grain is inspected under paragraph (d) of this section; or

        (3) When certification is at the option of the applicant in accordance with instructions.

        (d)  If grain in a carrier is offered for official inspection as two or more lots and the lots are separated by bulkheads or other partitions, the grain in each lot shall be sampled, inspected, and graded separately in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. An official certificate shall be issued for each lot inspected. Each certificate shall show the term “Bulkhead Lot,” the approximate quantity or weight of the grain in the lot, the location of the lot in the carrier, and the grade of the grain in the lot.

        (e)  If bulk grain offered for official inspection is at rest in a carrier or container and is fully accessible for sampling in an approved manner, except that the bottom of the carrier or container cannot be reached with each probe, the grain shall be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe. The grain in the resulting samples shall be inspected, graded, and certificated, except that each certificate shall show a statement, as specified in the instructions, indicating the depth probed. Any inspection which is based on a sample that does not represent the entire carrier or container does not meet the mandatory inspection requirements of section 5(a)(1) of the Act.

        (f) —(1)  When an “In” movement of bulk grain is offered for inspection at rest in a carrier or container and is loaded in such a manner that it is possible to secure only door-probe or shallow-probe samples, the container shall be considered to be “heavily loaded,” and the request for inspection either shall be dismissed or a partial inspection shall be made. If the request is for the inspection of an “Out” movement of grain, the request shall be dismissed on the grounds that the grain is not accessible for a correct “Out” inspection.

        (2)  If a partial inspection is made, the grain will be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe and inspected, graded, and a “partial inspection—heavily loaded” certificate issued. The certificate shall show the words “Partial inspection—heavily loaded” in the space provided for remarks. The type of samples that were obtained shall be described in terms of “door probe” or “shallow probe.”

        (3)  A request for a reinspection or an appeal inspection service on grain in a carrier or container that is certificated as “partial inspection—heavily loaded” shall be dismissed in accordance with § 800.48(a)(4).

        (4)  No “partial inspection—heavily loaded” certificate shall be issued for sacked grain or any inspection other than the inspections described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section and § 800.85(h)(2).

        (g) —(1)  If a portion of the grain in a carrier or container is removed, the grain that is removed and the grain remaining shall be considered separate lots. When an official inspection service is requested on either portion, the grain shall be sampled, inspected, graded, and a “part-lot” inspection certificate issued.

        (2)  The certificate for grain remaining in a carrier or container shall show (i) the following completed statement: “Partly unloaded; results based on portion remaining in (show carrier or container identification),” (ii) the term “Part lot” following the quantity information, (iii) the identification of the carrier or container, and (iv) the estimated amount and location of the part lot.

        (3)  If grain is sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate for the grain that is unloaded shall show (i) the completed statement: “Part lot; results based on portion removed from (show carrier identification)” and (ii) the term “Part lot” following the quantity information. If the grain is not sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate may, upon request of the applicant, show a completed statement such as “Applicant states grain is ex-car ” or “Applicant states grain is ex-barge ,” but the certificate shall not otherwise show a carrier or container identification or the term “Part lot.”

        (h)  The identification for compartments in a compartmented railcar shall, in the absence of readily visible markings, be stated in terms of the location of the grain in a compartment, with the first compartment at the brake end of the car being identified as B-1, and the remaining compartments being numbered consecutively towards the other end of the car.

        § 800.85   Inspection of grain in combined lots.

#### § § 800.85

        (a)  The official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked grain loaded aboard, or being loaded aboard, or discharged from two or more carriers or containers (including barges designed for loading aboard a ship) as a combined lot shall be performed according to the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions.

        (b) —(1) For inspection during loading, unloading, or at rest. Applications for official inspection of grain as a combined lot must:

        (i) Be filed in accordance with § 800.116;

        (ii) Show the estimated quantity of grain that is to be certified as one lot;

        (iii) Show the contract grade, and if applicable; other inspection criteria required by the contract; and

        (iv) Identify each carrier into which grain is being loaded or from which grain is being unloaded.

        (2)  An application for recertification as a combined lot of grain that has been officially inspected and certificated as two or more single lots shall (i) be filed not later than 2 business days after the latest inspection date of the single lots and (ii) show information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (c) —(1)  Grain in two or more land carriers or barges that are to be officially inspected as a combined lot, must be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Representative samples must be obtained from the grain in each individual carrier and inspected in accordance with procedures as prescribed in the instructions.

        (2)  Grain that has been officially inspected and certified as two or more single, composite, or average quality lots may be recertified as a combined lot provided that:

        (i) The grain in each lot was sampled in a reasonably continuous operation;

        (ii) The original inspection certificates issued for the single, composite, or average quality lots have been surrendered to official personnel;

        (iii) Representative file samples of the single, composite, or average quality lots are available;

        (iv) The grain in the single, composite, or average quality lots is of the same grade or better grade and quality than as specified in the written instructions provided by the shipper;

        (v) Official personnel who performed the inspection service for the single, composite, or average quality lots and the official personnel who are to recertify the grain as a combined lot must determine that the samples used as a basis for the inspection of the grain in the single, composite, or average quality lots were representative at the time of sampling and have not changed in quality or condition; and

        (vi) The quality or condition of the grain meets uniformity requirements established by the Service for official inspection of grain in combined lots.

        (d)  Official factor and official criteria information shown on a certificate for grain in a combined lot shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, be based on the weighted or mathematical averages of the analysis of the sublots in the lot and shall be determined in accordance with the instructions.

        (e)  If the grain in a combined lot is offered for official inspection as it is being loaded aboard a carrier and the grain, or a portion of the grain, in a lot is found to be infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for Grain, the applicant shall be notified and may exercise options specified in the instructions. When grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant shall be given the option of (1) receiving a grade certificate with a special grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (2) fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.

        (f)  Samples obtained from grain officially inspected as a combined lot shall be examined for uniformity of quality. If the grain in the samples is found to be uniform in quality and the grain is loaded aboard or is unloaded from the carriers in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in the combined lot shall be officially inspected and certificated as one lot. The requirements of this paragraph (f) and paragraph (c) of this section with respect to reasonably continuous loading or unloading do not apply to grain which is at rest in carriers when the grain is offered for inspection.

        (g)  When grain officially inspected as a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality or if the grain is not loaded or unloaded in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in each portion, and any grain which is loaded or unloaded at different times, shall be officially sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated as single lots.

        (h) —(1)  When grain in a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality under paragraph (g) of this section, the official inspection certificate for each portion of different quality shall show (i) the grade, identification, and approximate quantity of the grain and (ii) other information required by the instructions.

        (2)  When an inbound movement of bulk grain is offered for official inspection at rest as a combined lot and all carriers are not fully accessible for sampling, the request for official inspection either shall be dismissed or a combined lot inspection shall be made on those carriers that are accessible. Those lots that are not accessible shall be handled in accordance with § 800.84. If the request is for an official inspection service on an outbound movement of grain at rest in a combined lot, the request shall be dismissed on the ground that the grain is not accessible for a correct “Out” inspection.

        (3)  If grain in a combined lot is inspected for grade as it is being loaded aboard two or more carriers, upon request of the applicant, the following mark shall be shown on the inspection certificate: “Loaded under continuous official inspection” or “Loaded under continuous official inspection and weighing.”

        (4)  Each official certificate for a combined-lot inspection service must show the identification for the “combined lot” or, at the request of the applicant, the identification of each carrier in the combined lot. If the identification of each carrier is not shown, the statement “Carrier identification available on the official work record” must be shown on the inspection certificate in the space provided for remarks. The identification and any seal information for the carriers may be shown in the Remarks section on the reverse side of the inspection certificate, provided that the statement “See reverse side” is shown on the face of the certificate in the space provided for remarks, or on an additional page.

        (5)  If a request for a combined-lot inspection service is filed after the grain has been officially inspected and certified as single, composite, or average quality lots, the combined-lot inspection certificate must show, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section the following:

        (i) The date of inspection of the grain in the combined lot (if the single, composite, or average quality lots were inspected on different dates, the latest of the dates must be shown);

        (ii) A serial number other than the serial numbers of the official inspection certificates that are to be superseded;

        (iii) The location of the grain, if at rest, or the name(s) of the elevator(s) from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was loaded or unloaded;

        (iv) A statement showing the approximate quantity of grain in the combined lot;

        (v) A completed statement showing the identification of any superseded certificates; and

        (vi) If at the time of issuing the combined-lot inspection certificate the superseded certificates are not in the custody of the official personnel, a statement indicating that the superseded certificates have not been surrendered must be clearly shown in the space provided for remarks. If the superseded certificates are in the custody of official personnel, the superseded certificates must be clearly marked “Void.”

        (i)  After a combined-lot inspection certificate has been issued, there shall be no further combining and no dividing of the certificate.

        (j)  No combined-lot inspection certificate shall be issued (1) for any official inspection service other than as described in this section or (2) which shows a quantity of grain in excess of the quantity in the single lots.

        § 800.86   Inspection of shiplot, unit train, and lash barge grain in single lots.

#### § § 800.86

        (a)  Official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked grain aboard, or being loaded aboard, or being unloaded from a ship, unit train, or lash barges as a single lot shall be performed according to the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions.

        (b)  Applications for the official inspection of shiplot, unit train, and lash barges as a single lot shall:

        (1) Be filed in advance of loading or unloading;

        (2) Show the estimated quantity of grain to be certificated;

        (3) Show the contract grade and official criteria if applicable; and

        (4) Identify the carrier and stowage area into which the grain is being loaded, or from which the grain is being unloaded, or in which the grain is at rest.

        (c) —(1)  Shiplot, unit train, and lash barge grain officially inspected as a single lot shall be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Representative samples shall be obtained from the grain offered for inspection and inspected and graded in accordance with a statistical acceptance sampling and inspection plan according to the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions.

        (2)  The probability of accepting or rejecting portions of the lot during loading or unloading is dependent on inspection results obtained from preceding portions and the applied breakpoints and procedures. Breakpoints shall be periodically reviewed and revised based on new estimates of inspection variability. Tables 1 through 24 list the breakpoints for all grains.

        (3)  Grain which is offered for inspection as part of a single lot and accepted by a statistical acceptance sampling and inspection plan according to the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions shall be certificated as a single lot provided it was sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Official factor and official criteria information shown on the certificate shall be based on the weighted or mathematical averages of the analysis of sublots.

        (4)  When grain which is offered for inspection as part of a single lot is rejected by the plan or is not sampled in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in each portion shall be certificated separately. If any portion of grain is not accepted by the plan and designated a material portion, the applicant shall be promptly notified and have the option of:

        (i) Removing the material portion from the carrier; or

        (ii) Requesting the material portion be separately certificated; or

        (iii) Requesting either a reinspection or an appeal inspection of the material portion; or

        (iv) Requesting a reinspection service and/or an appeal inspection service on the entire lot.

        (5)  A reinspection or an appeal inspection may be requested on a material portion. A Board appeal inspection may also be requested on a material portion after the reinspection or appeal inspection. A reinspection, an appeal inspection, and a Board appeal inspection may be requested on the total sublots in the lot.

        (i)  A material portion designated by the plan may be reinspected or appeal inspected once in the field, but not both, and once at the Board of Appeals and Review. The reinspection or appeal inspection result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged with the original inspection determination. The Board appeal inspection result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged with the previous inspection result. The inspection plan tolerances shall be reapplied to the material portion grain to determine acceptance or rejection. If a material error is found, the reinspection or appeal inspection result shall replace the original inspection result or the Board appeal result shall replace the previous inspection result. For purposes of this section, a material error is defined as results differing by more than two standard deviations. Acceptance or rejection of that portion of grain shall be based on the reinspection or appeal inspection and on the Board appeal inspection result alone when a material error is found.

        (ii)  The applicant may request a reinspection service, an appeal inspection service, and a Board appeal inspection service on the entire lot. Inspection results for these services shall replace the previous inspection results. The tolerances shall be reapplied to all portions of the entire lot to determine acceptance or rejection.

        (d) —(1)  If gain or any portion of grain in a single shiplot, unit train, or lash barge lot is found to be infested, according to the provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for Grain, the applicant shall be promptly notified and have the option of:

        (i) Unloading the portion of infested grain from the lot and an additional amount of other grain in common stowage with the infested grain; or

        (ii) When applicable, completing the loading and treating all infested grain in the lot; or

        (iii) When applicable, treating the infested grain for the purpose of destroying the insects, subject to subsequent examination by official personnel; or

        § 800.116   How to request original services.

#### § § 800.116

        (a)  Except as otherwise provided for in § 800.117, requests for original services shall be filed with an agency or field office authorized to operate in the area in which the original service is to be performed. All requests shall include the information specified in § 800.46. Verbal requests shall be confirmed in writing when requested by official personnel, as specified in § 800.46. Copies of request forms may be obtained from the agency or field office upon request. If the information specified by § 800.46 is not available at the time the request is filed, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold service pending receipt of the required information. An official certificate shall not be issued unless the information as required by § 800.46 has been submitted, or official personnel determine that sufficient information has been made available so as to perform the requested service. A record that sufficient information was made available must be included in the record of the official service.

        (b)  Except as provided for in § 800.117, requests for original services, other than submitted sample inspections, must be made to the agency or field office responsible for the area in which the service will be provided. Requests for submitted sample inspections may be made with any agency, or any field office that provides original inspection service. Requests for inspection or Class X weighing of grain during loading, unloading, or handling must be received in advance of loading so official personnel can be present. All requests will be considered filed when official personnel receive the request. A record shall be maintained for all requests. All requests for service that is to be performed outside normal business hours must be received by 2 p.m. the preceding day.

> [68 FR 19139, Apr. 18, 2003]

        § 800.117   Who shall perform original services.

#### § § 800.117

        (a)  Original services shall be performed by the agency or field office assigned the area in which the service will be provided, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  Under an exception, an official agency may provide service to an applicant outside of their geographic area. The Service may grant exceptions in instances when: the assigned official agency is unable to provide inspection services in a timely manner; a person requesting inspection services in that geographic area has not been receiving official inspection services from the official agency for that geographic area; a person requesting inspection services in that geographic area requests a probe inspection on a barge-lot basis; or, the assigned official agency for that geographic area agrees in writing with the adjacent official agency to waive the current geographic area restriction at the request of the applicant for service. Excluding requests for probe inspections on a barge-lot basis, applicants requesting an exception must submit requests for a service exception to the Service.

        (1)  Service is not timely when an official agency cannot provide the requested official services within 6 hours or cannot provide the results and certificate in accordance with § 800.160(c). Timely service exception requests will also be considered for delays caused by weather events or for official services that the assigned official agency does not offer. The applicant must submit a request for a timely service exception to the Service. The applicant may make this request orally or in writing. If the applicant requests a timely service exception orally, the applicant must submit a written request to the Service within two business days of the request. The applicant must clearly state and support the identified reason for the requested timely service exception. There are three consecutive tiers of timely service exceptions: one-time, 90-day, and long-term. Applicants requesting 90-day or long-term timely service exceptions must progress through each previous tier sequentially. The Service will review timely service exception requests and may contact the applicant, the assigned official agency, or potential gaining official agency with questions during its review.

        (i)  In the case of an assigned official agency's inability to provide timely service, an applicant may be granted a one-time approval to use another official agency for the associated pending service request, as applicable.

        (A) For one-time, timely service exception requests, if the request is made during customary business hours, the Service will provide its decision that day.

        (B) If the applicant has an urgent timely service exception request, outside of the Service's customary business hours, an official agency from outside the geographic area may provide one-time service. When providing an urgent service, the gaining official agency must provide written notification to the Service within two business days after service.

        (C) Upon returning to official office hours, the Service will review and verify the circumstances of the urgent request, as well as its consistency with the U.S. Grain Standards Act and implementing regulations.

        (ii)  If there is an occurrence of untimely service within 180 days of the date of the occurrence in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the applicant may request a 90-day timely service exception. This 90-day window will begin the day the exception is granted.

        (iii)  If there is an occurrence of untimely service within 365 days after the applicant's return to service with the assigned official agency, following an exception granted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the applicant may request a long-term timely service exception. When granting this exception, the Service may continue the exception up to the date on which the gaining official agency's designation terminates.

        (iv)  The applicant must submit a request for a timely service exception to the Service. This request may include any associated supporting documentation the applicant feels is warranted. After receipt of the request, the Service will provide the applicant, assigned official agency, and potential gaining official agency an opportunity to submit any additional information in support of the timely service exception request in writing. The Service will request additional information, if needed.

        (v)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, prior to granting a timely service exception, the Service must review and verify information submitted with the request. When a timely service exception request is received, the Service will issue a written notification to acknowledge the receipt of the request to the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the potential gaining official agency. When possible, the Service should also attempt to make oral contact.

        (vi)  Once the applicant's request is received, the Service will notify the applicant and begin the review timeline. The Service will issue a determination within 15 business days for 90-day and long-term timely service exceptions, barring a challenge from the assigned official agency. While awaiting a final decision on 90-day and long-term timely service exceptions, the applicant may receive service from the potential gaining official agency.

        (vii)  The Service must notify the assigned official agency in writing upon receipt of the request for a timely service exception. At the completion of the request review process, the Service will issue written notification of the determination on the request to the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the gaining official agency. When possible, the Service should also attempt to make oral contact.

        (viii)  The assigned official agency may challenge a request for a timely service exception for any reason. To challenge a request for a timely service exception, the assigned official agency must object, in writing, and submit the challenge and any supporting documents to the Service.

        (A) Given the urgency of a one-time service request, if the assigned official agency wishes to challenge the request, it must be done in a manner which does not further delay the applicant from receiving the pending service. If the one-time timely service exception has already been granted or used, the assigned official agency may still challenge the Service's determination within 14 calendar days.

        (B) To challenge a 90-day or long-term timely service exception, the assigned official agency must submit the challenge and any supporting documents within 14 calendar days of the date of notification of the timely service exception request. The documents must clearly identify the objection and support the identified reason for the challenge.

        (ix)  In the event the Service determines that the assigned official agency is unable to provide official services in a timely manner, the Service will grant a timely service exception.

        (x)  If an applicant submits a request for a timely service exception that the Service determines to be false or misleading, the Service will not grant the exception and may elect to limit the applicant from submitting further requests for a period of up to 180 days. If an urgent request for a timely service exception, outside of customary business hours, was granted on the basis of a false or misleading request, the Service may deny the applicant from future timely service exceptions for a period of up to 180 days.

        (xi)  The applicant maintains the option of returning to the assigned official agency within 60 days of notification of termination of the timely service exception to all parties. The applicant must submit a written notification requesting to terminate the timely service exception to the Service, the assigned official agency and the gaining official agency. The timely service exception will be cancelled, and future timely service exception requests must be considered at the beginning of successive-tiered system.

        (xii)  If the Service determines the assigned official agency's inability to provide a specific service was limited due to weather events or for official services that the assigned official agency does (did) not offer, the cause of which has been resolved, the Service, in consultation with all the parties, may terminate the 90-day or long-term timely service exception. However, if the timely service exception was associated with the official agency's inability to provide service in 6 hours or less, or with its failure to issue the results and certificate in a timely manner, then the Service might elect not to terminate the timely service exception. The Service must notify the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the potential gaining official agency of all timely service exception termination decisions in writing. The assigned official agency must resume service within 60 days of notification.

        (2)  If an applicant has not received official inspection services from the assigned official agency within the last 90 days, the applicant may request, in writing, a nonuse of service exception. Periods of nonuse resulting from timely service exceptions will not qualify as part of a period of nonuse.

        (i)  Along with the request for an exception, the applicant must submit supporting documentation pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section and may submit any additional supporting material the applicant wishes to submit to the Service. After receipt of the request, the Service will provide the applicant, assigned official agency, and potential gaining official agency an opportunity to submit any additional information in writing. The Service will request additional information, if needed.

        (A)  The applicant's request for a nonuse of service exception must include the following information:

        () The last date of service from the assigned official agency;

        () The reason service has not been received during this time frame; and

        () The identified reason for the request.

        (B)  Applicants may submit any additional relevant supporting information. This may include, but is not limited to:

        () The location of the specified service need(s);

        () The types of services requested by the applicant and offered by the assigned official agency;

        () The ability of the assigned official agency to provide the requested service;

        () Whether the applicant's facility has ever used the official system; and

        () The impact on the applicant in the event it continues with the assigned official agency.

        (ii)  The Service will review the request for a nonuse of service exception and supporting documentation, then conduct any necessary analysis to estimate the exception's impact prior to making a determination, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section. When the Service receives a nonuse of service exception request, the Service will issue a written notification to acknowledge the receipt of the request to the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the potential gaining official agency.

        (iii)  The Service will make every attempt to complete the determination process in a timely manner, during which the applicant must continue with nonuse of service. This time period will include the allotted 14 calendar days in which the assigned official agency may challenge the request. The Service may extend the determination timeline when necessary.

        (iv)  The Service must notify the assigned official agency in writing upon receipt of the request for a nonuse of service exception. At the completion of the process, the Service will issue written notification of the determination on the request to the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the gaining official agency. When possible, the Service should also attempt to make oral contact.

        (v)  The assigned official agency may challenge a request for a nonuse of service exception for any reason. To challenge a nonuse of service exception, the assigned official agency must object in writing and must submit the challenge and any supporting documentation to the Service within 14 calendar days from the date of notification from the Service of receipt of the request for a nonuse of service exception for the applicant. The documents must clearly identify the objection and support the identified reason for the challenge.

        (vi)  The Service will consider impacts on the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the potential gaining official agency when deciding whether to grant a nonuse of service exception. These impacts may include, but are not limited to, the viability of the assigned official agency given the loss of business. The Service will also consider the impact on the official system and confirm a nonuse of service exception will not undermine the congressional policies in section 2 of the United States Grain Standards Act. The Service will provide its decision, in writing, to the applicant, the assigned official agency, and the potential gaining official agency. If approved, the applicant can receive service from either the originally assigned official agency or the gaining official agency.

        (vii)  If an applicant submits a request that the Service determines is false or misleading, the Service will not grant the nonuse of service exception and may elect to limit the applicant from submitting further requests for a period of up to 180 days.

        (viii)  The nonuse of service exception is for the period of the gaining official agency's designation. At the end of the designation, the Service will review the nonuse if service exception and verify the information. Unless the applicant, the assigned official agency, the gaining official agency, and the Service all agree to terminate the nonuse of service exception, the Service will renew the nonuse of service exception for the gaining official agency's new designation period. In the event the gaining official agency is no longer designated, the nonuse of service exception will automatically terminate, and the applicant will return to the assigned official agency. If the applicant transfers ownership of its facility, the nonuse of service exception will automatically terminate, and the new applicant/owner of the facility must request a new nonuse of service exception to receive service from an official agency other than the assigned official agency for that geographic area. At any point in the designation cycle, if the applicant, the assigned official agency, the gaining official agency, and FGIS jointly agree to terminate nonuse of service exception in writing, the Service will terminate the exception. In this case, the assigned official agency must resume service within 60 days of notification that the nonuse of service exception has been terminated.

        (ix)  All nonuse of service exceptions that were in place as of March 30, 2019, and that are currently active as of the date of effectuation of this rule, are incorporated within the list of active nonuse of service exceptions.

        (3)  Any official agency may provide probe sampling and inspection service for barge-lots of grain with no restrictions due to geographical locations.

        (4)  If the assigned official agency agrees in writing with the adjacent official agency to waive the current geographic area restriction at the request of the applicant for service, the adjacent official agency may provide service at a particular location upon providing written notice to the Service, and the Service determines that the written agreement conforms to the provisions in the Act.

        (c)  If the assigned official agency is not available on a regular basis to provide original services, and no official agency within a reasonable proximity is willing to provide such services on an interim basis, the services shall be provided by authorized employees of the Secretary, or other persons licensed by the Secretary, until the services can be provided on a regular basis by an official agency, as provided in § 800.196.

        § 800.125   Who may request reinspection services or review of weighing services.

#### § § 800.125

        (a)  Any interested person may request a reinspection or review of weighing service, except as provided for in § 800.86(c)(5). Only one reinspection service or review of weighing service may be performed on any original service. When more than one interested person requests a reinspection or review of weighing service, the first person to file is the applicant of record.

        (b)  A reinspection or review of weighing service is limited to the kind and scope of the original service. If the request specifies a different kind or scope, the request shall be dismissed but may be resubmitted as a request for original services: Provided, however, that an applicant for service may request a reinspection of a specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or official criteria. In addition, reinspections for grade may include a review of any pertinent factor(s), as deemed necessary by official personnel. Official criteria are considered separately from official grade or official factors when determining the kind and scope. When requested, a reinspection for official grade or official factors and official criteria may be handled separately even though both sets of results are reported on the same certificate. Moreover, a reinspection or review of weighing may be requested on either the inspection or Class X weighing results when both results are reported on a combination inspection and Class X weight certificate.

        § 800.187   Conflicts of interest

#### § § 800.187

        (a)  Warehouse samplers are exempt from the conflict-of-interest provisions of this section.

        (b)  For the purposes of these regulations, the term “gratuity” shall include any favor, entertainment, gift, tip, loan, payment for unauthorized or fictitious work, unusual discount, or anything of monetary value. The term shall not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal relationship (including those between official personnel and their parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work relationship.

        (c)  In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph shall also be considered to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no official personnel shall, during the term of their license or authorization (including any period of suspension):

        (1) Accept any gratuity.

        (2) Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i) the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing services.

        (3) Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest.

        (4) Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting, cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying, treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of equipment for cleaning, drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise processing, handling, or storing grain; or the merchandising of grain inspection or weighing equipment (other than buying or selling by official personnel of the equipment for use in the performance of their official services).

        (5) Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.

        (6) Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y weighing services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) producing grain as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide investments in governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings and loan associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are clearly not involved in the production, transportation, storage, marketing, or processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms.

        (d)  Official personnel shall report information regarding their employment or other business or financial interests which may be required by the Service.

        (e)  Official personnel shall not acquire any financial interest or engage in any activity that would result in a violation of this § 800.187, or § 800.186, or section 11 of the Act and shall not permit their spouses, minor children, or blood relatives who reside in their immediate households to acquire any such interest or engage in any such activity. For the purpose of this section, the interest of a spouse, minor child, or blood relative who is a resident of the immediate household of official personnel shall be considered to be an interest of the official personnel.

        (f) —(1)  Upon being informed that a conflict of interest exists and that remedial action is required, an applicant for a license and official personnel shall take immediate action to end the conflict of interest and inform the Service of the action taken.

        (2)  Applicants and official personnel who believe that remedial action will cause undue personal hardship may request an exception by forwarding to the Service a written statement setting forth the facts, circumstances, and reasons for requesting an exception.

        (3)  If a final determination is made by the Service that a conflict of interest does exist and should not be excepted, failure to terminate the conflict of interest shall subject: (i) An applicant for a license to a dismissal of the application; (ii) An employee of the Service to disciplinary action; and (iii) A licensee to license revocation.

Each State shall report to the Service information which shows or may show a violation of any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions and information on any instructions which have been issued to State personnel by Service personnel or by any other person which are contrary to or inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or instructions.

        (5)  (i)  The delegated State and any commissioner, director, employee, or other related person or entity shall not have a conflict of interest, as defined in section 11 of the Act and § 800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be waived pursuant to § 800.199(d).

When an application is dismissed, the Service shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the reason(s) for the dismissal.

        (2)  Each applicant for authority to operate as as designated agency shall be reviewed to determine whether the applicant meets the conditions and criteria contained in sections 7(f)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, § 800.199 of the regulations, and paragraph (g) of this section.

        (ii)  Each agency shall test the equipment it uses for official services according to the instructions.

        (9)  Each agency shall establish a certificate control system for all official certificates it receives, issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide for (i) recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would permit retrieval.

        (10)  Each agency shall maintain the records specified in §§ 800.145 through 800.159.

        (h) —(1) —(i)  A designation shall terminate at a time specified by the Administrator, but not later than 5 years after the effective date of the designation. A notice of termination shall be issued by the Service to a designated agency at least 120 calendar days in advance of the termination date. The notice shall provide instructions for requesting renewal of the designation.

        (ii)  Designations may be renewed, upon application, in accordance with criteria and procedures for designation prescribed in section 7(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. The Administrator may decline to renew a designation if:

        (A) The requesting agency fails to meet or comply with any of the criteria for designation set forth in the Act, regulations, and instructions, of

        (B) The Administrator determines that another qualified applicant is better able to provide official services in the assigned area.

        (3)  An agency may request that its designation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.

        (A) The agency has failed to meet one or more of the criteria specified in section 7(f) of the Act or the regulations for the performance of official functions, or otherwise has not complied with any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions, or

        (B) Has been convicted of any violation of other Federal law involving the handling or official inspection of grain.

        (ii)  The Service may, without first affording the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the “respondent”) an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the respondent.

        (iii)  Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the section, before the Service revokes or suspends a designation, the respondent shall be: (A) Notified by the Service of the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR part 1, subpart H). Before initiating formal adjudicatory proceedings, the Service may, at its discretion, afford the respondent an opportunity to present its views on the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference. If, as a result of the informal conference, a consent agreement is reached, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.

        (i)  If the designation of an agency is suspended, terminated, or the renewal of a designation is not granted, the Service shall attempt, upon a finding of need, to arrange for a replacement agency. If a qualified replacement agency cannot be designated on a timely basis, a qualified agency, if available, shall be designated on an interim basis. If a qualified agency is not available on an interim basis, the Service shall provide needed services on an interim basis.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        Terms Defined

          § 810.101   Grains for which standards are established.

#### § § 810.101

          Grain refers to barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mixed grain, oats, rye, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower seed, triticale, and wheat. Standards for these food grains, feed grains, and oilseeds are established under the United States Grain Standards Act.

> [57 FR 3274, Jan. 29, 1992]

          § 810.102   Definition of other terms.

#### § § 810.102

          Unless otherwise stated, the definitions in this section apply to all grains. All other definitions unique to a particular grain are contained in the appropriate subpart for that grain.

          (a)  Grain that is obviously of inferior quality because it is in an unusual state or condition, and that cannot be graded properly by use of other grading factors provided in the standards. Distinctly low quality includes the presence of any objects too large to enter the sampling device; , large stones, wreckage, or similar objects.

          (b)  Water content in grain as determined by an approved device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.

          (c)  Concreted earthy or mineral matter and other substances of similar hardness that do not disintegrate in water.

          (d)  The weight per Winchester bushel (2,150.42 cubic inches) as determined using an approved device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions. Test weight per bushel in the standards for corn, mixed grain, oats, sorghum, and soybeans is determined on the original sample. Test weight per bushel in the standards for barley, flaxseed, rye, sunflower seed, triticale, and wheat is determined after mechanically cleaning the original sample. Test weight per bushel is recorded to the nearest tenth pound for corn, rye, sorghum, soybeans, triticale, and wheat. Test weight per bushel for all other grains, if applicable, is recorded in whole and half pounds with a fraction of a half pound disregarded. Test weight per bushel is not an official factor for canola.

          (e)  Grain with   or less of the kernel removed.

        Principles Governing the Application of Standards

          § 810.103   Basis of determination.

#### § § 810.103

          (a)  The determination of distinctly low quality is made on the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of sampling when a condition exists that may or may not appear in the representative sample and/or the sample as a whole.

          (b)  Each determination of rodent pellets, bird droppings, other animal filth, broken glass, castor beans, cockleburs, crotalaria seeds, dockage, garlic, live insect infestation, large stones, moisture, temperature, an unknown foreign substance(s), and a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s) is made on the basis of the sample as a whole. When a condition exists that may not appear in the representative sample, the determination may be made on the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of sampling according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.

          (c)  The basis of determination for all other factors is contained in the individual standards.

          § 810.104   Percentages.

#### § § 810.104

          (a)  Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and are rounded as follows:

          (1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.

          (2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 5, retain the figure; e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3, and 1.22 as 1.2.

          (b)  The percentage of dockage in flaxseed and sorghum is reported in whole percent with fractions of a percent being disregarded. Dockage in barley and triticale is reported in whole and half percent with a fraction less than one-half percent being disregarded. Dockage in wheat and rye is reported in whole and tenth percents to the nearest tenth percent. Foreign material in sunflower seed is reported to the nearest one-half percent. Ranges of sunflower seed foreign material are reported as follows: 0.0 to 0.24 is reported as 0.0 percent, 0.25 to 0.74 as 0.5 percent, 0.75 to 1.24 as 1.0 percent, and the like. Foreign material and fines in mixed grain is reported in whole percent. The percentage of smut in barley, sclerotinia and stones in canola, and ergot in all grains is reported to the nearest hundredth percent. The percentage when determining the identity of all grains is reported to the nearest whole percent. Also reported to the nearest whole percent are the classes and subclasses in wheat; flint corn; flint and dent corn; waxy corn; classes in barley; and the percentage of each kind of grain in mixed grain. Plump barley shall be expressed in terms of the range in which it falls. Ranges shall be: Below 50 percent, 50 to 55 percent, 56 to 60 percent, 61 to 65 percent, and the like. All other percentages are reported in tenths percent.

          § 868.91   Fees for certain Federal rice inspection services.

#### § § 868.91

          The fees for services in paragraph (a) apply to Federal inspection services. Starting with fiscal year 2022, calculations provided in paragraph (b) will be used to determine annual fee rates.

          (a) Fees for services are published on the Service's website.

          (b) For each fiscal year, starting with 2022, the Administrator will calculate the rates for services, issue a public notice, and publish fees on the Service's website with an effective date of October 1 of each year.

          (1) For each year, the Administrator will calculate the rates for services, per hour per inspection program employee using the following formulas:

          (i)  The Service's total inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, actual travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

          (ii)  The Service's total inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, actual travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

          (iii)  The Service's total inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, actual travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

          (2) For each year, based on previous year/historical actual costs, the Administrator will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime, and holiday rates as follows:

          (i)  The Service's total inspection program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.

          (ii)  The Service's total inspection program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.

          (iii)  Total allowance for bad debt, divided by total hours (regular, overtime, holiday) worked.

          (3) The Administrator will use the most recent economic factors released by the Office of Management and Budget for budget development purposes to derive the cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section.

#### § § 868.101

        The Agricultural Marketing Service, (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient marketing of agricultural products by maintaining voluntary grade standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, which provide a uniform language for describing the quality of these commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, classes, quality levels, performance criteria, and inspection requirements. Procedures contained in this part set forth the process which AMS will follow in developing, issuing, revising, suspending, or terminating the U.S. standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils. Communications about AMS standards in general should be addressed to the Administrator, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-3601.

        § 868.102   Procedures for establishing and revising grade standards.

#### § § 868.102

        (a) AMS will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review, development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, trade associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such persons may at any time recommend that AMS develop, revise, suspend, or terminate a grade standard. Requests for action should be in writing, and should be accompanied by a draft of the suggested change, as appropriate.

        (b) AMS will:

        (1) Determine the need for new or revised standards;

        (2) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;

        (3) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as appropriate; and

        (4) Draft the proposed standards.

        (c) If AMS determines that new standards are needed, existing standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of existing standards is justified, AMS will undertake the action with input from interested parties.

        § 868.103   Public notification of grade standards action.

#### § § 868.103

        (a) After developing a standardization proposal, AMS will publish a notice in the  proposing new or revised standards or suspending or terminating existing standards. The notice will provide a sufficient comment period for interested parties to submit comments.

        (b) AMS will simultaneously issue a news release about these actions, notifying the affected industry and general public. AMS will also distribute copies of proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to anyone it believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or local government agencies.

        (c) All comments received within the comment period will be made part of the public record maintained by AMS, will be available to the public for review, and will be considered by AMS before final action is taken on the proposal.

        (d) Based on the comments received, AMS's knowledge of standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant information, AMS will decide whether the proposed actions should be implemented.

        (e) If AMS concludes that the changes as proposed or with appropriate modifications should be adopted, AMS will publish the final changes in the  as a final notice. AMS will make the grade standards and related information available in printed form and electronic media.

        (f) If AMS determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, AMS will either publish in the  a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.

        (5) A warehouse operator may not issue an EWR on a specific identity-preserved or commingled lot of agricultural product or any portion thereof while another valid warehouse receipt representing the same specific identity-preserved or commingled lot of agricultural product remains not canceled. No two warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse operator may have the same warehouse receipt number or represent the same agricultural product lot.

        (6) An EWR may only be issued to replace a paper warehouse receipt if requested by the current holder of the paper warehouse receipt.

        (7) Holders and warehouse operators may authorize any other user of their provider or the provider itself to act on their behalf with respect to their activities with this provider. This authorization must be in writing, and acknowledged and retained by the warehouse operator and provider.

        (c) A warehouse operator not licensed under the Act may, at the option of the warehouse operator, issue EWRs in accordance with this subpart, except this option does not apply to a warehouse operator that is licensed under State law to store agricultural products in a warehouse if the warehouse operator elects to issue an EWR under State law.

#### § § 870.15

      (a) AMS will notify the appropriate investigating agencies of the United States and CCC may terminate the Agreement and demand a full refund of payments plus interest and suspend and debar the offending company from further government participation as deemed necessary to protect the interests of the government, if the eligible domestic user is suspected by AMS to have knowingly:
