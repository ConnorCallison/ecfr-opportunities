Payment of $100,000 is received in March 1963 when the contract is signed, and the balance of $900,000 is received in June 1963 on delivery of the vessel. The $1,000,000 is deposited in a construction reserve fund in July 1963. In December 1963, the taxpayer also deposits $150,000, representing earnings of that year. In 1964, he sells another vessel for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $250,000. The sale price of $1,000,000 is received on delivery of the vessel in February 1964, and deposited in the construction reserve fund in March 1964. In September 1964, the taxpayer purchases for cash out of the construction reserve fund a new vessel for $1,750,000. To the cost of this vessel must be allocated the 1963 deposits of $1,150,000 and $600,000 of the March 1964 deposit. This leaves in the fund $400,000 of the March 1964 deposit. The amount of the unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of the new vessel is $550,000, computed as follows: Gain of $400,000 represented in the 1963 deposits, plus the same proportion of the $250,000 gain represented in the March 1964 deposit ($1,000,000) which the amount ($600,000) allocated to the vessel is of the amount of the deposit, i.e., $400,000 plus 600,000/1,000,000 of $250,000 or $150,000, a total of $550,000.

The $3,000,000 is received and deposited in the construction reserve fund in June 1965, making a total in the fund of $3,400,000. In December 1965, the taxpayer contracts for the construction of a second new vessel to cost a maximum of $3,200,000, thereby obligating that amount of the fund, and in June 1966, receives permission to withdraw the unobligated balance amounting to $200,000. To the cost of the second new vessel must be allocated the $400,000 balance of the March 1964 deposit and $2,800,000 of the June 1965 deposit. The unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of such new vessel is that proportion of the gain represented in each deposit which the portion of the deposit allocated to the vessel bears to the amount of such deposit, i.e., 400,000/1,000,000 of $250,000, or $100,000 plus 2,800,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $840,000 making a total of $940,000. The $200,000 withdrawal is applied against the June 1965 deposit and the portion thereof which represents gain will be recognized as income for 1965, the year in which realized. The computation of the recognized gain is as follows: 200,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $60,000."

Consideration must be given to the fact that it will not be possible in every case to get lower bids by extending a completion date beyond the normal time required to do the work merely because the vessel's availability is exceptionally long. At the same time, care is to be exercised to insure that the repair period is not shortened, when there is no urgent need for the use of the vessel, to such an extent that it is impossible for the contractor to accomplish the work under normal working conditions.

The contractor shall be verbally advised of a time and place for the submission of the “Spot Bids.” If such bids are invited by the General Agent, the General Agent shall also advise the Coast Director or his duly appointed representative of the time and place of opening the “Spot Bids,” and if practicable, the NSA representative shall attend such opening.

If, on the other hand, the “fair inference rule” is applied with respect to stock ownership (see Collier Advertising Service, Inc. v. Hudson River Day Line, 14 Fed. Supp. 335), the extent of U.S. citizen ownership of stock should be ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 percent for foreign operation and 95 percent for coastwise operation) in order that the veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5) may be relied upon by the Maritime Administration.\n",
                  "(b) When applying the fair inference rule (where there are more than 30 stockholders, except where one or more of such number actually owns the controlling or 75 percent interest) in order to prove U.S. citizen ownership in the required percentages (1) for foreign operation, 65 percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by persons with registered addresses within the United States to prove that 51 percent or controlling interest is vested in citizens of the United States and (2) for coastwise operation, 95 percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by persons having registered addresses within the United States to prove that 75 percent of the interest in the corporation is vested in citizens of the United States.\n",
                  "(c) If the primary corporation is consecutively owned by several “parent” corporations (holders of 100 percent of the stock of each or all classes or series of stock issued and outstanding), the facts should be given in proper sequence either by chart or in narrative form, revealing the facts of stock ownership. The information with respect to the ultimate parent should include data relative to the basis upon which controlling or 75 percent (depending upon whether the primary corporation operates in the domestic or foreign commerce) is established, together with the names of the owners of record or beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of each class or series of stock, if more than one class or series, and statement that such owners are citizens of the United States. In any case where different classes or series of stock exist, each class or series shall be treated depending upon whether “closely held” or “publicly held,” individually in applying the fair inference rule, if applicable, or giving the relevant information with respect to United States citizens owning of record 51 percent or 75 percent of the interest.\n\n\n"

Shipper agencies considering bids resulting in the lowest landed cost of transportation based on U.S.-flag rates and service shall include within the comparison of U.S.-flag rates and service, for shipments originating in U.S. Great Lakes ports, through rates (if offered) to a Canadian port or other point on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and a U.S.-flag leg for the remainder of the voyage. The “fair and reasonable” rate for this mixed service will be determined by considering the U.S.-flag component under the existing regulations at 46 CFR part 382 or 383, as appropriate, and incorporating the cost for the foreign-flag component into the U.S.-flag “fair and reasonable” rate in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used to lighten U.S.-flag vessels in the recipient country's territorial waters.

This section applies to all program and individual transactions where the choice of award instruments is within the administrative discretion of MarAd and is not otherwise prescribed or limited by law. A variety of award instruments is available as the means for defining the terms and conditions and the nature of the relationship between MarAd and eligible recipients. The award instruments are intended to be different in purpose, application, content, and nature. When properly employed, they create different relationships between the parties. Because of these differences, the decision to use a particular instrument must be made deliberately. The determination of whether a program, to be implemented through individual transactions, is principally one of acquisition or assistance will be made by the Grants Officer. MarAd generally will employ the cooperative agreement form of assistance instrument but will employ the grant form where deemed appropriate.\n",

Under the agreement, X is required to deposit into the fund all earnings and gains received from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund, an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in § 391.2(c), and an amount equal to 50 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels provided that such 50 percent does not exceed X's taxable income from all sources for the year of deposit. The agreement permits X to make voluntary deposits of amounts equal to 100 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, subject to the limitation with respect to taxable income from all sources. The agreement also provides that deposits attributable to such earnings may be in the form of cash or other property. On March 15, 1973, X deposits, with respect to its 1972 earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, stock with a fair market value at the time of deposit of $80,000 and an adjusted basis to X of $10,000. Such deposit represents agreement vessel income of $80,000. At the time of deposit, such stock had been held by X for a period exceeding 6 months. X does not elect under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to defer recognition of the gain. Accordingly, under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the deposit is treated as a deposit of $80,000 and X realizes a long-term capital gain of $70,000 on March 15, 1973."
