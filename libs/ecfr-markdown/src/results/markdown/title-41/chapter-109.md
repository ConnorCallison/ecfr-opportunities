        (a) Notification to appropriate DOE organizations and law enforcement offices;

        (b) Determination of cause or origin;

        (c) Liability and responsibility for repair or replacement; and

        (d) Actions taken to prevent further loss, damage, or destruction, and to prevent repetition of similar incidents.

        § 109-1.5113   Loss, damage, or destruction of personal property in possession of designated contractors.

#### § § 109-1.5113

        (a) Designated contractors shall report any loss, damage, or destruction of personal property in its possession or control, including property in the possession or control of subcontractors, to the property administrator as soon as it becomes known.

        (b) When physical inventories, consumption analyses, or other actions disclose consumption of property considered unreasonable by the property administrator; or loss, damage, or destruction of personal property not previously reported by the contractor, the property administrator shall require the contractor to investigate the incidents and submit written reports.

        (c) Reports of physical inventory results and identified discrepancies shall be submitted to the property administrator within 90 days of completion of physical inventories. An acceptable percentage of shrinkage for stores inventories shall be determined by the property administrator on a location-by-location basis, based on type and cost of materials, historical data, and other site-specific factors. This determination shall be in writing and be supported by appropriate documentation.

        (d) The contractor's report referenced above shall contain factual data as to the circumstances surrounding the loss, damage, destruction or excessive consumption, including:

        (1) The contractor's name and contract number;

        (2) A description of the property;

        (3) Cost of the property, and cost of repairs in instances of damage (in event actual cost is not known, use reasonable estimate);

        (4) The date, time (if pertinent), and cause or origin; and

        (5) Actions taken by the contractor to prevent further loss, damage, destruction, or unreasonable consumption, and to prevent repetition of similar incidents.

        (e) The property administrator shall ensure that the corrective actions taken by the contractor under paragraph (d)(5) of this section satisfactorily address system weaknesses.

        (f) The contracting officer shall make a determination of contractor liability with a copy of the determination furnished to the contractor and the property administrator. Costs may be assessed against a contractor for physical inventory discrepancies or other instances of loss of Government property within the terms of the contract. Credit should only be applied if specific items reported as lost can be uniquely identified. General physical inventory write-ons are not to be used as a credit.

        (g) If part of a designated contractor's personal property management system is found to be unsatisfactory, the property administrator shall increase surveillance of that part to prevent, to the extent possible, any loss, damage, destruction or unreasonable consumption of personal property. The property administrator shall give special attention to reasonably ensuring that any loss, damage, destruction or unreasonable consumption occurring during a period when a contractor's personal property management system is not approved is identified before approval or reinstatement of approval.

        § 109-1.5114   Use of non-Government-owned property.

#### § § 109-1.5114

        Non-Government-owned personal property shall not be installed in, affixed to, or otherwise made a part of any Government-owned personal property when such action will adversely affect the operation or condition of the Government property.

        This subpart prescribes policy and responsibilities for the establishment, maintenance, and appraisal of designated contractors' programs for the management of personal property.

        § 109-1.5201   Policy.

#### § § 109-1.5201

        (a) Designated contractors shall establish, implement, and maintain a system that provides for an efficient personal property management program. The system shall be consistent with the terms of the contract; prescribed policies, procedures, regulations, statutes, and instructions; and directions from the contracting officer.

        (b) Designated contractors' personal property management systems shall not be considered acceptable until reviewed and approved in writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in accordance with § 109-1.5205 of this subpart.

        (c) Designated contractors shall maintain their personal property management systems in writing. Revisions to the systems shall be approved in writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in accordance with § 109-1.5205 of this subpart.

        (d) Designated contractors shall include their personal property management system in their management surveillance or internal review program in order to identify weaknesses and functions requiring corrective action.

        (e) Designated contractors are responsible and accountable for all Government personal property in the possession of subcontractors, and shall include appropriate provisions in their subcontracts and property management systems to assure that subcontractors establish and maintain efficient systems for the management of Government personal property in their possession in accordance with § 109-1.5204 of this subpart.

        § 109-1.5202   Establishment of a personal property holdings baseline.

#### § § 109-1.5202

        (a) If the contractor is a new designated contractor, the contractor may accept the previous contractor's personal property records as a baseline or may perform a complete physical inventory of all personal property. This physical inventory is to be performed within the time period specified by the contracting officer or the contract, but no later than one year after the execution date of the contract. If the physical inventory is not accomplished within the allotted time frame, the previous contractor's records will be considered as the baseline.

        (b) If any required physical inventories have not been accomplished within the time periods prescribed in § 109-1.5110(f) of this part, the new contractor shall either perform such physical inventories within 120 days of contract renegotiation, or accept the existing property records as the baseline.

        § 109-1.5203   Management of subcontractor-held personal property.

#### § § 109-1.5203

        Designated contractors shall require those subcontractors provided Government-owned personal property to establish and maintain a system for the management of such property. As a minimum, a subcontractor's personal property management system shall provide for the following:

        (a) Adequate records.

        (b) Controls over acquisitions.

        (c) Identification as Government-owned personal property.

        (d) Physical inventories.

        (e) Proper care, maintenance, and protection.

        (f) Controls over personal property requiring special handling ( nuclear-related, proliferation-sensitive, hazardous, or contaminated property).

        (g) Reporting, redistribution, and disposal of excess and surplus personal property.

        (h) Accounting for personal property that is lost, damaged, destroyed, stolen, abandoned, or worn out.

        (i) Periodic reports, including physical inventory results and total acquisition cost of Government property.

        (j) An internal surveillance program, including periodic reviews, to ensure that personal property is being managed in accordance with established procedures.

        § 109-1.5204   Review and approval of a designated contractor's personal property management system.

#### § § 109-1.5204

        (a) An initial review of a designated contractor's personal property management system shall be performed by the property administrator within one year after the execution date of the contract, except for contract extensions or renewals or when an existing contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the contractor's system provides adequate protection, maintenance, utilization, and disposition of personal property, and reasonable assurance that the Department's personal property is safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation, in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, contract terms and conditions, programmatic needs, and good business practices. If circumstances preclude completion of the initial review within the “within one year” initial review requirement, the property administrator shall request a deviation from the requirement in accordance with the provisions of § 109-1.110-50 of this part.

        (b) If a designated contractor is the successor to a previous designated contractor and the contract award was based in part on the contractor's proposal to overhaul the existing personal property management system(s), the “within one year” initial review requirement may be extended based on:

        (1) The scope of the overhaul; and

        (2) An analysis of the cost to implement the overhaul within a year versus a proposed extended period.

        (c) When an existing contract has been extended or renewed, or the designated contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract, an initial review of the contractor's personal property management system is not required. In such cases, the established appraisal schedule will continue to be followed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d) At a minimum of every three years after the date of approval of a designated contractor's property management system, the OPMO/PA shall make an appraisal of the personal property management operation of the contractor. The purpose of the appraisal is to determine if the contractor is managing personal property in accordance with its previously approved system and procedures, and to establish whether such procedures are efficient. The appraisal may be based on a formal comprehensive appraisal or a series of formal appraisals of the functional segments of the contractor's operation.

        (e) A designated contractor's property management system shall be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved in writing by the head of the field organization with advice of the contracting officer, property administrator, OPMO, legal counsel, and appropriate program officials. Approval authority may be redelegated to the contracting officer or OPMO/PA. Conditional approval and disapproval authority cannot be redelegated. When a system is conditionally approved or disapproved, the property administrator or contracting officer shall advise the contractor, in writing, of deficiencies that need to be corrected, and a time schedule established for completion of corrective actions.

        (f) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator to ensure that corrective actions have been initiated and completed.

        (g) When a determination has been made by the property administrator that all major system deficiencies identified in the review or appraisal have been corrected, the head of the field organization shall withdraw the conditional approval or disapproval, and approve the system with the concurrence of the OPMO/PA. The approval shall be in writing and addressed to appropriate contractor management.

        (h) The property administrator shall maintain a copy of all designated contractor personal property management system appraisals and approvals in such manner as to be readily available to investigative and external review teams.

        § 109-1.5205   Personal property management system changes.

#### § § 109-1.5205

        Any proposed significant change to a designated contractor's approved personal property management system shall be reviewed by the property administrator at the earliest possible time. Such changes should then be approved in writing on an interim basis, or disapproved in writing, by the property administrator as appropriate.

      Subpart 109-1.53—Management of High Risk Personal Property

        § 109-1.5300   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 109-1.5300

        (a) This subpart provides identification, accounting, control, and disposal policy guidance for the following categories of high risk personal property: Especially designed or prepared property, export controlled property, nuclear weapon components or weapon-like components, and proliferation sensitive property. The guidance is intended to ensure that the disposition of these categories of high risk personal property does not adversely affect the national security or nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the United States.

        (b) The other categories of high risk personal property are controlled by other life cycle management programs and procedures monitored by other Departmental elements.

        § 109-1.5301   Applicability.

#### § § 109-1.5301

        This subpart is applicable to all DOE organizations which purchase, manage or dispose of Government personal property, or contract for the management of Government facilities, programs, or related services, which may directly or indirectly require the purchase, management, or disposal of Government-owned personal property. Using the high-risk personal property control requirements in this subpart as guidance, Program Secretarial Officer (PSO) or OPMOs/PAs shall ensure that designated contractors and financial assistance recipients are responsible for developing a cost effective high-risk property management system, covering all operational responsibilities enumerated in this subpart.

        § 109-1.5302   Policies.

#### § § 109-1.5302

        (a) It is the responsibility of DOE organizations and designated contractors to manage and control Government-owned high risk personal property in an efficient manner. High-risk personal property will be managed throughout its life cycle so as to protect public and DOE personnel safety and to advance the national security and the nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the U.S. Government.

        (b) The disposition of high risk property is subject to special considerations. Items of high risk property may present significant risks to the national security and nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the Government which must be evaluated. Organizations will identify high risk property and control its disposition to eliminate or mitigate such risks. In no case shall property be transferred or disposed unless it receives a high risk assessment and is handled accordingly.

        § 109-1.5303   Procedures.

#### § § 109-1.5303

        (a)  To ensure the appropriate treatment of property at its disposal and to prevent inadvertent, uncontrolled release of high risk property, property should be assessed and evaluated as high risk property as early in its life cycle as practical.

        (1) Newly acquired high risk personal property shall be identified and tracked during the acquisition process and marked upon receipt.

        (2) All personal property shall be reviewed for high risk identification, marking, and database entry during regularly scheduled physical inventories, unless access to the property is difficult or impractical because the property is a component of a larger assembly, a complex operating system, or an older facility. The review of this property will be completed, prior to disposition, when replacing components or when operating systems and facilities are decommissioned and dismantling.

        (3) High risk personal property which by its nature cannot be marked, such as stores items and metal stock, is exempt from this requirement. However, personal property management programs should contain documentation on the characterization of this property as high risk.

        (b)  (1) Prior to disposition, all personal property, materials or data will be assessed to determine:

        (i) Whether it should be characterized as high risk, and

        (ii) What actions are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable national security or nonproliferation controls.

        (2) The DOE or designated contractor property management organization may not process high risk personal property into a reutilization/disposal program without performing the reviews prescribed by the local high risk property management system. The reviews must be properly documented, and all appropriate certifications and clearances received, in accordance with the approved site or facility personal property management program.

        (3) The disposition (including demilitarization of items on the Munitions List) and handling of high risk personal property are subject to applicable provisions of subchapter H of the FPMR/FMR, subchapter H of this chapter, and the DOE Guidelines on Export Control and Nonproliferation.

        (4) All applicable documentation, including records concerning the property's categorization as high risk, shall be included as part of the property transfer. The documentation shall be included with all transfers within, or external to, DOE.

        (5) Unless an alternative disposition option appears to be in the best interest of the Government, surplus Trigger List components, equipment, and materials and nuclear weapon components shall either be sold for scrap after being rendered useless for their originally intended purpose or destroyed, with the destruction verified and documented. Requests for approval of an alternative disposition may be made through the cognizant Assistant Secretary to the Director of the Office of Nonproliferation and National Security.

        (6) The following Export Restriction Notice, or approved equivalent notice, shall be included in all transfers, sales, or other offerings:

        § 109-1.5304   Deviations.

#### § § 109-1.5304

        (a) Life cycle control determinations. When the PSO approves a contractor program containing controls, other than life cycle control consistent with this subpart, the decision shall be justified in writing and a copy sent to the Office of Management. A PSO's decision not to provide life-cycle control should take into account:

        (1) The nature and extent of high risk property typically purchased or otherwise brought to a DOE or designated contractor facility or site;

        (2) The projected stability of DOE and designated contractor operations; and

        (3) The degree of confidence in the property control measures available at disposition.

        (b) Certain transfers, sales, or other offerings of high risk personal property may require special conditions or specific restrictions as determined necessary by the property custodian or cognizant program office.

        (c) Requests for deviations from the requirements of this subpart may be made through the cognizant PSO to the Office of Management.

      Subpart 109-38.51—Utilization of Motor Equipment

        § 109-38.5100   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 109-38.5100

        This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the utilization of motor equipment.

        § 109-38.5101   Policy.

#### § § 109-38.5101

        It is DOE policy to keep the number of motor vehicles and other motor equipment at the minimum needed to satisfy programmatic requirements. To attain this goal, controls and practices shall be established which will achieve the most practical and economical utilization of motor equipment. These controls and practices apply to all DOE-owned and commercially leased motor equipment and to GSA Interagency Fleet Management System motor vehicles.

        § 109-38.5102   Utilization controls and practices.

#### § § 109-38.5102

        Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and designated contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of motor equipment shall include, but not be limited to:

        (a) The maximum use of motor equipment pools, taxicabs, shuttle buses, or other common service arrangements;

        (b) The minimum, practicable assignment of motor equipment to individuals, groups, or specific organizational components;

        (c) The maintenance of individual motor equipment use records, such as trip tickets or vehicle logs, or hours of use, as appropriate, showing sufficiently detailed information to evaluate appropriateness of assignment and adequacy of use being made. If one-time use of a motor vehicle is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the motor vehicle and show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure and return, and mileage;

        (d) The rotation of motor vehicles between high and low mileage assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy;

        (e) The charging, if considered feasible, to the user organization for the cost of operating and maintaining motor vehicles assigned to groups or organizational components. These charge-back costs should include all direct and indirect costs of the motor vehicle fleet operation as determined by the field organization and contractor finance and accounting functions;

        (f) The use of dual-purpose motor vehicles capable of hauling both personnel and light cargo whenever appropriate to avoid the need for two motor vehicles when one can serve both purposes. However, truck-type or van vehicles shall not be acquired for passenger use merely to avoid statutory limitations on the number of passenger motor vehicles which may be acquired;

        (g) The use of motor scooters and motorcycles in place of higher cost motor vehicles for certain applications within plant areas, such as mail and messenger service and small parts and tool delivery. Their advantage, however, should be weighed carefully from the standpoint of overall economy (comparison with cost for other types of motor vehicles) and increased safety hazards, particularly when mingled with other motor vehicle traffic; and

        (h) The use of electric vehicles for certain applications. The use of these vehicles is encouraged wherever it is feasible to use them to further the goal of fuel conservation.

        § 109-38.5103   Motor vehicle utilization standards.

#### § § 109-38.5103

        (a) The following average utilization standards are established for DOE as objectives for those motor vehicles operated generally for those purposes for which acquired:

        (1) Sedans and station wagons, general purpose use—12,000 miles per year.

        (2) Light trucks (4 x 2's) and general purpose vehicles, one ton and under (less than 12,500 GVWR)—10,000 miles per year.

        (3) Medium trucks and general purpose vehicles, 1  ton through 2  ton (12,500 to 23,999 GVWR)—7,500 miles per year.

        (4) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles, three ton and over (24,000 GVWR and over)—7,500 miles per year.

        (5) Truck tractors—10,000 miles per year.

        (6) All-wheel-drive vehicles—7,500 miles per year.

        (7) Other motor vehicles—No utilization standards are established for other trucks, ambulances, buses, law enforcement motor vehicles, and special purpose vehicles. The use of these motor vehicles shall be reviewed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager and action shall be taken and documented to verify that the motor vehicles are required to meet programmatic, health, safety, or security requirements.

        (b) When operating circumstances prevent the above motor vehicle utilization standards from being met, local use objectives must be established and met as prescribed in § 109-38.5105 of this subpart.

        § 109-38.5104   Other motor equipment utilization standards.

#### § § 109-38.5104

        No utilization standards are established for motor equipment other than motor vehicles. Each DOE office should establish through an agreement between the fleet manager and the OPMO utilization criteria for other motor equipment including heavy mobile equipment and review, adjust, and approve such criteria annually. Utilization of various classifications of other motor equipment can be measured through various statistics including miles, hours of use, number of trips, and fuel consumption. A utilization review of other motor equipment shall be performed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager to justify retainment or disposition of excess equipment not needed to fulfill Departmental, programmatic, health, safety, or security requirements.

        § 109-38.5105   Motor vehicle local use objectives.

#### § § 109-38.5105

        (a) Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly, efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The objectives should take into consideration past performance, future requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating requirements.

        (b) These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager. The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all proposed local use objectives.

        § 109-38.5106   Application of motor vehicle use goals.

#### § § 109-38.5106

        (a) At least annually, the motor equipment fleet manager will review motor vehicle utilization statistics and all motor vehicles failing to meet the applicable DOE utilization standard or local use objective must be identified.

        (b) Prompt action must be initiated to:

        (1) Reassign the underutilized motor vehicles;

        (2) Dispose of the underutilized motor vehicles; or

        (3) Obtain a special justification from users documenting their continued requirement for the motor vehicle and any proposed actions to improve utilization. Any requirement for underutilized motor vehicles which the motor equipment fleet manager proposes to continue in its assignment, must be submitted in writing to the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager for approval.

        (c) Both Department-wide standards and local use objectives should be applied in such a manner that their application does not stimulate motor vehicle use for the purpose of meeting the objective. The ultimate standard against which motor vehicle use must be measured is that the minimum number of motor vehicles will be retained to satisfy program requirements.

      Subpart 109-38.52—Watercraft

        § 109-38.5200   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 109-38.5200

        (c) Operators shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws pertaining to the operation of watercraft.

        (d) Operators shall not use watercraft or carry passengers except in the performance of official Departmental assignments.

        § 109-38.5203   Watercraft identification and numbers.

#### § § 109-38.5203

        Watercraft in the custody of DOE or designated contractors shall display identifying numbers, whether issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, State, or local field organization, in accordance with applicable requirements.

      § 109-38.000   Scope of part.

#### § § 109-38.000

      § 109-38.000-50   Policy.

#### § § 109-38.000-50

#### § § 109-45.304-2.50

        (a) Negotiated sales by designated contractors of surplus contractor inventory may be made when the DOE contracting officer determines and documents prior to the sale that the use of this method of sale is justified on the basis of the circumstances enumerated below, provided that the Government's interests are adequately protected. These sales shall be at prices which are fair and reasonable and not less than the proceeds which could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the personal property was offered for competitive sale. Specific conditions justifying negotiated sales include:

        (1) No acceptable bids have been received as a result of competitive bidding under a suitable advertised sale;

        (2) Personal property is of such small value that the proceeds to be derived would not warrant the expense of a formal competitive sale;

        (3) The disposal will be to a state, territory, possession, political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the estimated fair market value of the personal property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation;

        (4) The specialized nature and limited use potential of the personal property would create negligible bidder interest;

        (5) Removal of the personal property would result in a significant reduction in value, or the accrual of disproportionate expense in handling; or

        (6) It can be clearly established that such action is in the best interests of the Government.

        (b) When determined to be in the best interests of the Government, Program Secretarial Officer (PSO) may authorize fixed-price sales of surplus contractor inventory by designated contractors provided:

        (1) The fair market value of the item to be sold does not exceed $15,000;

        (2) Adequate procedures for publicizing such sales have been established;

        (3) The sales prices are not less than could reasonably be expected if competitive bid sales methods were employed and the prices have been approved by a reviewing authority designated by the head of the field organization; and

        (4) The warranty prescribed in § 109-45.302-50(a) of this subpart is obtained when sales are made to employees.

        § 109-45.304-6   Reviewing authority.

        § 109-45.5101   Authority.

#### § § 109-45.5101

        The policies and procedures contained in this subpart are issued pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, former 40 U.S.C. ., as amended.

        § 109-45.5102   General.

#### § § 109-45.5102

#### § § 109-45.5104

        § 109-45.5104-1   General.

#### § § 109-45.5104-1

        Foreign excess personal property which is not required for transfer within DOE or to other U.S. Government agencies, except for the personal property identified in § 109-45.5005-1(a) of this part, shall be considered surplus and may be disposed of by transfer, sale, exchange, or lease, for cash, credit, or other property and upon such other terms and conditions as may be deemed proper. Such personal property may also be donated, abandoned, or destroyed under the conditions specified in § 109-45.5105-2 of this subpart. Most foreign governments have indicated to the U.S. State Department that they wish to be consulted before U.S. Government property is disposed of in their countries (except in the case of transfers to other U.S. Government agencies). Matters concerning customs duties and taxes, or similar charges, may require prior agreement with the foreign government involved. The State Department shall be contacted in regard to these issues. Whenever advice or approval of the State Department is required by this subpart, it may be obtained either through the foreign service post in the foreign area involved or from the State Department in Washington, DC. If the issue is to be presented to the State Department in Washington, DC, it shall be referred through appropriate administrative channels to the Office of International Affairs for review, coordination, and handling.

        § 109-45.5104-2   Methods of disposal.

#### § § 109-45.5104-2

        (a) Sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted in accordance with the following guidelines:

        (1) Generally, all sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous to the U.S. Government.

        (2) In no event shall any personal property be sold in foreign areas without a condition which states that its importation into the United States is forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (in the case of any agricultural commodity, food, cotton, or woolen goods), or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other property), has determined that the importation of such property would relieve domestic shortages or otherwise be beneficial to the economy of the United States.

        (3) Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any import duties or taxes levied against personal property sold in the country involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax shall not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government for the personal property. In the event the levy is placed upon the seller by law, the buyer will be required to pay all such duties or taxes and furnish the seller copies of his receipts prior to the release of the personal property to him. However, if the foreign government involved will not accept payment from the buyer, the seller will collect the duties or taxes and turn the amounts collected over to the foreign government. Accounting for the amounts collected shall be coordinated with the disbursing officer of the nearest United States foreign service post. The property shall not be released to the purchaser until the disposal officer is satisfied that there is no responsibility for payment by the United States (as contrasted to collection by the United States) of taxes, duties, excises, etc.

        (4) Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department for the sale of certain categories of personal property, including small arms and machine guns; artillery and projectiles; ammunition, bombs, torpedoes, rockets and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range finders; tanks and ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents, propellants and explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment; aircraft and all components, parts and accessories for aircraft; military electronic equipment; aerial cameras, military photo-interpretation, stereoscopic plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and all material not enumerated which is included in the United States Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01, and is subject to disposal restrictions. Therefore, prior to the sale of any of the articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign service post in the area shall be consulted.

        (5) All proposed sales, regardless of the total acquisition cost of personal property involved, which the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a significant economic or political impact in a particular area, shall be discussed with the foreign service post.

        (b) While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign surplus personal property, such authority shall be exercised only when such action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government. Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals by sale under § 109-45.5105-2 of this subpart.

        (c)(1) Foreign excess or surplus personal property (including salvage and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided:

        (i) The property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; and

        (ii) A written finding to that effect is made and approved by the Office of International Affairs.

        (2) No personal property shall be abandoned or destroyed if donation is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to any agency of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health, or charitable nonprofit organizations.

        (3) Foreign excess personal property may also be abandoned or destroyed when such action is required by military necessity, safety, or considerations of health or security. A written statement explaining the basis for disposal by these means and approval by the Office of International Affairs.

        (4) Property shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which is detrimental or dangerous to public health and safety, or which will cause infringement on the rights of other persons.

        § 109-45.5105   Reports.

#### § § 109-45.5105

        (a) Proposed sales of foreign surplus personal property shall include all pertinent data, including the following:

        (1) The description of personal property to be sold, including:

        (i) Identification of personal property (description should be in terms understandable to persons not expert in technical nomenclature). Personal property covered by the U.S. Munitions List and regulations pertaining thereto (as published in 22 CFR 121.1) should be clearly identified;

        (ii) Quantity;

        (iii) Condition; and

        (iv) Acquisition cost.

        (2) The proposed method of sale ( sealed bid, negotiated sale, etc.)

        (3) Any currency to be received and payment provisions ( U.S. dollars, foreign currency, or credit, including terms of the proposed sale).

        (4) Any restrictions on use of personal property to be sold (such as resale of property, disposal as scrap, demilitarization, etc.).

        (5) Any special terms or conditions of sale.

        (6) The categories of prospective purchasers ( host country, other foreign countries, special qualifications, etc.).

        (7) How taxes, excises, duties, etc., will be handled.
