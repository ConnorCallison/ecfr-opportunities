    Subpart 128-1.1—Regulation System

      § 128-1.100   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 128-1.100

      This subpart introduces the Department of Justice Property Management Regulations (JPMR) as part of the Federal Property Management Regulations System (FPMR) (41 CFR part 101); states its relationship to the FPMR; and provides instructions for the issuance and use of these property management policies and procedures of the Department of Justice.

      § 128-1.101   Justice Property Management Regulations.

#### § § 128-1.101

      The JPMR, established in this subpart, implement and supplement, as necessary, the FPMR provisions governing the acquisition, utilization, management, and disposal of real and personal property. The JPMR are issued to establish uniform property management policies, regulations, and, as necessary, procedures in the Department of Justice.

      § 128-1.105   Authority for JPMR.

#### § § 128-1.105

      The Department of Justice Property Management Regulations are prescribed by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration under authority of 5 U.S.C. 301, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), 41 CFR 101-1.108, and 28 CFR 0.75(j).

      § 128-1.152   Citation.

#### § § 128-1.152

      The JPMR will be cited in accordance with the  standards applicable to the FPMR. Accordingly, when this section is referred to formally in official documents, it should be cited as “41 CFR 128-1.152.” When a section of the JPMR is referred to informally, however, it may be identified simply by “JPMR” followed by the complete paragraph reference number, e.g., “JPMR 128-1.152.”

For management and accounting control, personal property is categorized as follows:

      (a) “Expendable personal property” is that which, by its nature or function, is consumed in use; is used as repair parts or components of an end product considered nonexpendable; or has an expected service life of less than one year.

      (b) “Non-expendable personal property” is that which is complete within itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put into use, and is of a durable nature with an expected service life one or more years.

      (c) “Controlled personal property” is that personal property for which good management practice dictates that it would be in the interest of the Government to assign and record accountability to assure the proper use, maintenance, protection and disposal of property for which the Government is responsible. Includes, but is not restricted to property which:

      (1) Is leased by, in the custody of, or is loaned to or from the Department.

      (2) Due to inherent attractiveness and/or portability is subject to a high probability of theft or misuse.

      (3) Is warranted, requires knowledge of age and/or previous repair data when determining whether repair or replacement is appropriate.

      § 128-1.5002-6   Personal property management.

#### § § 128-1.5002-6

      A system for controlling the acquisition, receipt, storage issue, utilization, maintenance, protection, accountability, and disposal of personal property to best satisfy the program needs of the Department.

      (a) The Attorney General of the United States has the primary authority and responsibility for providing direction, leadership, and general supervision in the development and administration of an effective and efficient supply support system for the Department, to include:

      (1) The establishment of Department-wide policies, directions, regulations, and procedures satisfying the requirements of law, regulations, and sound management practice; and

      (2) The review, evaluation, and improvement of personal property management programs, functions, operations, and procedures throughout the Department.

      (b) Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.75 and subject to the general supervision of the Attorney General and the direction of the Deputy Attorney General, the functions described above are assigned to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration as delegations of authority.

      § 128-1.5004   Basis for delegations of authority and assignment of responsibilities.

#### § § 128-1.5004

      Certain personal property management functions can be performed by an individual only under a specific grant of authority to that individual. Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions listed in § 128-1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

      § 128-1.5005   Delegations of authority.

#### § § 128-1.5005

      § 128-1.5005-1   Primary delegations.

#### § § 128-1.5005-1

      (a) Designating the PMO, for the bureau, within the following limitations:

      (1) Only one PMO is to be designated for the bureau, at the bureau level. Neither the title designation nor the responsibilities of the PMO are to be delegated below that level.

      (2) One or more PC's also may be designated for the bureau, depending upon the size and complexity of the organizational structure. Each PC is responsible solely for that property within his respective jurisdiction. The number and distribution of PC's designated is entirely at the option of the head of the bureau.

      (3) There is no restriction on designating a single individual as PMO and PC providing that the functions and responsibilities are compatible and are within the capabilities of a single person.

      (b) Authorizing exceptions to the FPMR use and replacement standards for office machines, furniture, furnishings and typewriters specified in §§ 101-25.3 and 101-25.4.

      (k) Recommending non-Federal grantee excess property screeners to GSA as required in FPMR 101-43.320(h).

      (l) When authorized by statutory authority, vesting title to Government-furnished personal property in contractors or grantees.

      (m) Acquiring excess personal property from other bureaus and from other Federal agencies.

      § 128-1.5005-2   Redelegations of authority.

#### § § 128-1.5005-2

      (a) The authorities delegated by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration to heads of bureaus may, in turn, be redelegated as necessary to enable personal property management functions to be performed at the organizational level best equipped to handle such functions, unless otherwise prohibited by this regulation.

      (b) Such redelegations can be made without the specific approval of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration to deputies, principal administrative officers, heads of field offices and installations and their respective deputies. Such redelegations shall not conflict with the duties or responsibilities assigned to the PMO, or PC under the JPMR.

      (b) If the owner of such property is known, the owner shall be notified within 20 days of finding such property by certified mail at the owner's address of record that the property may be claimed by the owner or his designee and that if the property is not claimed within 30 days from the date the letter of notification is postmarked, the title of the property will vest in the United States.

      (c) If the owner of such property is not known and the estimated value of the property exceeds $100, the bureau shall post notice within 20 days of finding such property, which contains the following information:

      (1) A description of the property including model or serial numbers, if known.

      (2) A statement of the location where the property was found and the office that has custody of it.

      (3) A statement that any person desiring to claim the property must file with the bureau within 30 days from the date of first publication a claim for said property.

      (4) A complete mailing address is to be provided as a point of contact within the bureau for any person to obtain additional information concerning the property or the procedures involved in filing a claim.
