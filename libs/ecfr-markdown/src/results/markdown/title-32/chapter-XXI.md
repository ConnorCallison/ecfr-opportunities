    § 2102.1   Introduction.

#### § § 2102.1

    (a) Insofar as the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to the National Security Council (hereafter NSC), it provides the American public with expanded opportunities to gain access to records maintained by the NSC Staff which may pertain to them as individuals. These regulations are the exclusive means by which individuals may request personally identifiable records and information from the National Security Council.

    (b) The NSC Staff, in addition to performing the functions prescribed in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 401), also serves as the supporting staff to the President in the conduct of foreign affairs. In doing so the NSC Staff is acting not as an agency but as an extension of the White House Office. In that the White House Office is not considered an agency for the purposes of this Act, the materials which are used by NSC Staff personnel in their role as supporting staff to the President are not subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. A description of these White House Office files is, nevertheless, appended to the NSC notices of systems of files and will be published annually in the

    (c) In general, Records in NSC files pertain to individual members of the public only if these individuals have been (1) employed by the NSC, (2) have corresponded on a foreign policy matter with a member of the NSC or its staff, or (3) have, as a U.S. Government official, participated in an NSC meeting or in the preparation of foreign policy-related documents for the NSC.

    § 2102.2   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 2102.2

    (a) The following regulations set forth procedures whereby individuals may seek and gain access to records concerning themselves and will guide the NSC Staff response to requests under the Privacy Act. In addition, they outline the requirements applicable to the personnel maintaining NSC systems of records.

    (b) These regulations, published pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, Section 552a (f) and (k), 5 U.S.C. (hereinafter the Act), advise of procedures whereby an individual can:

    (1) Request notification of whether the NSC Staff maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to him or her in any non-exempt system of records;

    (2) Request a copy of such record or an accounting of that disclosure;

    (3) Request an amendment to a record; and,

    (4) Appeal any initial adverse determination of any request under the Act.

    (c) These regulations also specify those systems of records which the NSC has determined to be exempt from certain provisions of the Act and thus not subject to procedures established by this regulation.

      § 2103.3   Applicability.

#### § § 2103.3

      This regulation governs the National Security Council Staff Information Security Program. In consonance with the authorities listed in § 2103.1, it establishes the policy and procedures for the security classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding of information that is owned by, is produced for or by, or is under the control of the National Security Council Staff.

      § 2103.11   Basic policy.

#### § § 2103.11

      § 2103.12   Level of original classification.

#### § § 2103.12

      Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to which designation in section 1-1 of Executive Order 12065 is appropriate, or whether information should be classified at all, the less restrictive designation should be used, or the information should not be classified.

      § 2103.13   Duration of original classification.

#### § § 2103.13

      Original classification may be extended beyond six years only by officials with Top Secret classification authority. This extension authority shall be used only when these officials determine that the basis for original classification will continue throughout the entire period that the classification will be in effect and only for the following reasons:

      (a) The information is “foreign government information” as defined by the authorities in § 2301.1;

      (b) The information reveals intelligence sources and methods;

      (c) The information pertains to communication security;

      (d) The information reveals vulnerability or capability data, the unauthorized disclosure of which can reasonably be expected to render ineffective a system, installation, or project important to the national security;

      (e) The information concerns plans important to the national security, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably can be expected to nullify the effectiveness of the plan;

      (f) The information concerns specific foreign relations matters, the continued protection of which is essential to the national security;

      (g) Disclosure of the information would place a person's life in immediate jeopardy; or

      (h) The continued protection of the information is specifically required by statute.

      § 2103.14   Challenges to classification.

#### § § 2103.14

      If holders of classified information believe that the information is improperly or unnecessarily classified, or that original classification has been extended for too long a period, they should discuss the matter with their immediate superiors or the classifier of the information. If these discussions do not satisfy the concerns of the challenger, the matter should be brought to the attention of the chairperson of the NSC Information Security Oversight Committee (see § 2103.51 of this part).

    Subpart C—Derivative Classification

      § 2103.21   Definition and application.

#### § § 2103.21

      Derivative classification is the act of assigning a level of classification to information that is determined to be the same in substance as information that is currently classified.
