### Part 1800

    PART 1801—FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS SYSTEM

### Part 1801

**Authority:** Authority: 51 U.S.C. 20113(a) and 48 CFR chapter 1.

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 40534, Aug. 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart 1801.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance

        1801.103   Authority. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

#### § 1801.103

        (a) Under the following authorities, the Administrator has delegated to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement authority to prepare, issue, and maintain the NFS:

        (i) The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-568; 42 U.S.C. 2451 ).

        (ii) 10 U.S.C. chapter 137.

        (iii) Other statutory authority.

        (iv) FAR subpart 1.3.

        1801.104   Applicability.

#### § 1801.104

        The NFS applies to all acquisitions as defined in FAR part 2 except those expressly excluded by the FAR or this chapter.

        1801.105   Issuance.

#### § 1801.105

        1801.105-1   Publication and code arrangement.

#### § 1801.105-1

        (b)(i) The NFS is an integrated document that contains both acquisition regulations that require public comment and internal Agency guidance and procedures that do not require public comment. NASA personnel must comply with all regulatory and internal guidance and procedures contained in the NFS.

        (ii) NFS regulations that require public comment are issued as chapter 18 of title 48, CFR.

        (iii) The single official NASA-maintained version of the NFS is on the Internet ().

        1801.105-2   Arrangement of regulations. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

#### § 1801.105-2

        (b)(1)(A) Numbering of NFS text implementing the FAR shall be the same as that of the related FAR text, except when the NFS coverage exceeds one paragraph. In such case the NFS text is numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example, two paragraphs implementing FAR 1.105-2(b)(1) are numbered 1801.105-2(b)(1) (A) and (B), rather than (1) (i) and (ii). Further subdivision of the NFS implementing paragraphs would follow the prescribed sequence in FAR 1.105(b)(2).

        (B) NFS text that supplements the FAR is numbered the same as its FAR counterpart with the addition of a number 70 and up. For example, NFS supplement of FAR subsection 1.105-3 is numbered 1801.105-370. Supplemental text exceeding one paragraph is numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence without skipping a unit.

        (2) Subdivision numbering below the fourth level repeats the numbering sequence using italicized letters and numbers.

        1801.106   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § 1803.905

        (a) Unless the NASA Inspector General makes a determination that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in 1803.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, the NASA Inspector General will investigate the complaint.

        (b) If the NASA Inspector General determines that a complaint merits further investigation, the NASA Inspector General will—

        (1) Notify the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the Agency;

        (2) Conduct an investigation; and

        (3) Provide a written report of findings to the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the Agency.

        (c) The NASA Inspector General—

        (1) Will determine that the complaint is frivolous or will submit the report addressed in paragraph (b) of this section within 180 days after receiving the complaint; and

        1803.906   Remedies.

#### § 1803.906

        (a) Not later than 30 days after receiving a NASA Inspector General report in accordance with 1803.905, the head of the Agency shall determine whether sufficient basis exists to conclude that the contractor has subjected the complainant to a reprisal as prohibited by 1803.903 and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:

        (1) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.

        (2) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.

        (3) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the Agency.

        (b) If the head of the Agency issues an order denying relief or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of the complaint or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension of time granted in accordance with 1803.905(3)(ii), and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant—

        (1) The complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint; and

        (2) The complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under 10 U.S.C. 4701 in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.

        (c) Whenever a contractor fails to comply with an order issued by the head of agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701, the head of the Agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.

        (d) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the Agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701 may obtain judicial review of the order's conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.

        (e) The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.

      Subpart 1809.5—Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest

        1809.505-4   Obtaining access to sensitive information.

#### § 1809.505-4

        (b) In accordance with FAR 9.503, the Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that it would not be in the Government's interests for NASA to comply strictly with FAR 9.505-4(b) when acquiring services to support management activities and administrative functions. The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has, therefore, waived the requirement that before gaining access to other companies' proprietary or sensitive (see 1837.203-70) information contractors must enter specific agreements with each of those other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure. Accordingly, NASA will not require contractors and subcontractors and their employees in procurements that support management activities and administrative functions to enter into separate, interrelated third party agreements to protect sensitive information from unauthorized use or disclosure. As an alternative to numerous, separate third party agreements, 1837.203-70 prescribes detailed policy and procedures to protect contractors from unauthorized use or disclosure of their sensitive information. Nothing in this section waives the requirements of FAR 37.204 and 1837.204.

      Subpart 1812.70—Commercial Space Hardware or Services

        1812.7000   Anchor tenancy contracts.

#### § 1812.7000

        (a) The term “anchor tenancy” means an arrangement in which the United States Government agrees to procure sufficient quantities of a commercial space product or service needed to meet Government mission requirements so that a commercial venture is made viable.

        (b) Subject to receiving an appropriation that:

        (1) Authorizes a multi-year anchor tenancy contract; and

        (2) Specifies the commercial space product or service to be developed or used, NASA may enter into a multi-year anchor tenancy contract only if Administrator determines—

        (i) The good or service meets the mission requirements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;

        (ii) The commercially procured good or service is cost effective;

        (iii) The good or service is procured through a competitive process;

        (iv) Existing or potential customers for the good or service other than the United States Government have been specifically identified;

        (v) The long-term viability of the venture is not dependent upon a continued Government market or other nonreimbursable Government support; and

        (vi) Private capital is at risk in the venture.

        (c) Contracts entered into under such authority may provide for the payment of termination liability in the event that the Government terminates such contracts for its convenience.

        (1) Contracts that provide for this payment of termination liability shall include a fixed schedule of such termination liability payments. Liability under such contracts shall not exceed the total payments which the Government would have made after the date of termination to purchase the good or service if the contract were not terminated.

        (2) Subject to appropriations, funds available for such termination liability payments may be used for purchase of the good or service upon successful delivery of the good or service pursuant to the contract. In such case, sufficient funds shall remain available to cover any remaining termination liability.

        (d)  (1) Contracts entered into under such authority shall not exceed 10 years in duration.

        (2) Such contracts shall provide for delivery of the good or service on a firm, fixed price basis.

        (3) To the extent practicable, reasonable performance specifications shall be used to define technical requirements in such contracts.

        (4) In any such contract, the Administrator shall reserve the right to completely or partially terminate the contract without payment of such termination liability because of the contractor's actual or anticipated failure to perform its contractual obligations.

        (a) NASA personnel participating in any way in the evaluation may not reveal any information concerning the evaluation to anyone not also participating, and then only to the extent that the information is required in connection with the evaluation. When non-NASA personnel participate, they shall be instructed to observe these restrictions.

        (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the procurement officer is the approval authority to disclose proposal information outside the Government. If outside evaluators are involved, this authorization may be granted only after compliance with FAR 37.2 and 1837.204, except that the determination of unavailability of Government personnel required by FAR 37.2 is not required for disclosure of proposal information to JPL employees.

        (2) Proposal information in the following classes of proposals may be disclosed with the prior written approval of a NASA official one level above the NASA program official responsible for the overall conduct of the evaluation. If outside evaluators are involved, the determination of unavailability of Government personnel required by FAR 37.2 is not required for disclosure in these instances.

#### § 1815.305-70

        (a) The contracting officer shall not complete the initial evaluation of any proposal when it is determined that the proposal is unacceptable because:

        (1) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates that the offeror does not understand the requirements;

        (2) In research and development acquisitions, a substantial design drawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or improvement to consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually an entirely new technical proposal; or

        (3) It contains major deficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonably be expected to cure.

        (b) The contracting officer shall document the rationale for discontinuing the initial evaluation of a proposal in accordance with this section.

This waiver applies to the CCC and its subcontractors. The CCC will provide assurance of the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price. This assurance should be relied on; however, contracting officers shall ensure that the appropriate level of data other than certified cost or pricing data is submitted by subcontractors to support any required proposal analysis, including a technical analysis and a cost realism analysis. The CCC also will provide for follow-up audit activity to ensure that any excess profits are found and refunded to NASA.

        (b) NASA has waived the requirement for the submission of certified cost or pricing data when contracting for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase II contracts. However, contracting officers shall ensure that the appropriate level of data other than certified cost or pricing data is submitted to determine price reasonableness and cost realism.

      Subpart 1816.3—Cost-Reimbursement Contracts

        1816.303-70   Cost-sharing contracts.

#### § 1816.303-70

        (a)  (1) Cost sharing by for-profit organizations is mandatory in any contract for basic or applied research resulting from an unsolicited proposal, and may be accepted in any other contract when offered by the proposing organization. The requirement for cost-sharing may be waived when the contracting officer determines in writing that the contractor has no commercial, production, education, or service activities that would benefit from the results of the research, and the contractor has no means of recovering its shared costs on such projects.

        (2) The contractor's cost-sharing may be any percentage of the project cost. In determining the amount of cost-sharing, the contracting officer shall consider the relative benefits to the contractor and the Government. Factors that should be considered include—

        (i) The potential for the contractor to recover its contribution from non-Federal sources;

        (ii) The extent to which the particular area of research requires special stimulus in the national interest; and

        (iii) The extent to which the research effort or result is likely to enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive advantage.

        (b)  (1) Costs to perform research stemming from an unsolicited proposal by universities and other educational or not-for-profit institutions are usually fully reimbursed. When the contracting officer determines that there is a potential for significant benefit to the institution cost-sharing will be considered.

        (2) The contracting officer will normally limit the institution's share to no more than 10 percent of the project's cost.

        (c)  Cost-sharing shall be stated as a minimum percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. The contractor's contributed costs may not be charged to the Government under any other contract or grant, including allocation to other contracts and grants as part of an independent research and development program.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause substantially as stated at 1852.216-74, Estimated Cost and Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.

        (c) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-75, Payment of Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.

        (d) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-81, Estimated Cost, in cost-no-fee contracts that are not cost sharing or facilities contracts.

        (e) [Reserved]

        (f) When FAR clause 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, is included in the contract, as prescribed at FAR 16.307(a), the contracting officer should include the clause at 1852.216-89, Assignment and Release Forms.

        (g) As required by section 827 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239), use the clause at 1852.216-90, Allowability of Costs Incurred in Connection With a Whistleblower Proceeding—

      Subpart 1816.4—Incentive Contracts

        1816.402   Application of predetermined, formula-type incentives. (NASA paragraphs 1, 2 and 3).

#### § 1816.402

        When considering the use of a quality, performance, or schedule incentive, the following guidance applies:

        (1) A positive incentive is generally not appropriate unless—

        (i) Performance above the target (or minimum, if there are no negative incentives) level is of significant value to the Government;

        (ii) The value of the higher level of performance is worth the additional cost/fee;

        (iii) The attainment of the higher level of performance is clearly within the control of the contractor; and

        (iv) An upper limit is identified, beyond which no further incentive is earned.

        (2) A negative incentive is generally not appropriate unless—

        (i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach with a diligent effort, but a lower level of performance is also minimally acceptable;

        (ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; and

        (iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor.

        (3) When a negative incentive is used, the contract must indicate a level below which performance is not acceptable.

        1816.402-2   Performance incentives.

#### § 1816.402-2

        1816.402-270   NASA technical performance incentives.

#### § 1816.402-270

        (a) Pursuant to the guidelines in 1816.402, NASA has determined that a performance incentive shall be included in all contracts that are based on performance-oriented documents (see FAR 11.101(a)), except those awarded under the commercial item procedures of FAR Part 12, where the primary deliverable(s) is (are) hardware with a total value (including options) greater than $25 million. Any exception to this requirement shall be approved in writing by the head of the contracting activity. Performance incentives may be included in supply and service contracts valued under $25 million, acquired under procedures other than Part 12, at the discretion of the contracting officer upon consideration of the guidelines in 1816.402. Performance incentives, which are objective and measure performance after delivery and acceptance, are separate from other incentives, such as cost or delivery incentives.

        (b) When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to be both positive and negative based on performance after acceptance, unless the contract type requires complete contractor liability for product performance ( fixed price). In this latter case, a negative incentive is not required. In structuring the incentives, the contract shall establish a standard level of performance based on the salient performance requirement. This standard performance level is normally the contract's target level of performance. No performance incentive amount is earned at this standard performance level. Discrete units of measurement based on the same performance parameter shall be identified for performance above and, when a negative incentive is used, below the standard. Specific incentive amounts shall be associated with each performance level from maximum beneficial performance (maximum positive incentive) to, when a negative incentive is included, minimal beneficial performance or total failure (maximum negative incentive). The relationship between any given incentive, either positive or negative, and its associated unit of measurement should reflect the value to the Government of that level of performance. The contractor should not be rewarded for above-standard performance levels that are of no benefit to the Government.

        (c) The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done when performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is reached. When performance ceases below the standard established in the contract and a negative incentive is included, the Government shall calculate the amount due and the contractor shall pay the Government that amount. Once performance exceeds the standard, the contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly. When performance ceases above the standard level of performance, or when the maximum positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the contractor.

        (d) When the deliverable supply or service lends itself to multiple, meaningful measures of performance, multiple performance incentives may be established. When the contract requires the sequential delivery of several items ( multiple spacecraft), separate performance incentive structures may be established to parallel the sequential delivery and use of the deliverables.

        (e) In determining the value of the maximum performance incentives available, the contracting officer shall follow the following rules:

        (1) For a CPFF contract, the sum of the maximum positive performance incentive and fixed fee shall not exceed the limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).

        (2) For an award fee contract.

        (i) The individual values of the maximum positive performance incentive and the total potential award fee (including any base fee) shall each be at least one-third of the total potential contract fee. The remaining one-third of the total potential contract fee may be divided between award fee and the maximum performance incentive at the discretion of the contracting officer.

        (ii) The maximum negative performance incentive for research and development hardware (e.g., the first and second units) shall be equal in amount to the total  award fee (including any base fee). The maximum negative performance incentives for production hardware (e.g., the third and all subsequent units of any hardware items) shall be equal in amount to the total  award fee (including any base fee). Where one contract contains both cases described above, any base fee shall be allocated reasonably among the items.

        (3) For cost reimbursement contracts other than award fee contracts, the maximum negative performance incentives shall not exceed the total earned fee under the contract.

#### § 1816.405-270

        (a) In addition to the items identified in FAR 16.401(e)(1), D&Fs will include a discussion of the other types of contracts considered and shall indicate why an award fee incentive is the appropriate choice. Award fee incentives should not be used on contracts with a total estimated cost and fee less than $2 million per year. Use of award fee incentive for lower-valued acquisitions may be authorized in exceptional situations such as contract requirements having direct health or safety impacts, where the judgmental assessment of the quality of contractor performance is critical.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an award fee incentive may be used in conjunction with other contract types for aspects of performance that cannot be objectively assessed. In such cases, the cost incentive is based on objective formulas inherent in the other contract types ( FPI, CPIF), and the award fee provision should not separately incentivize cost performance.

        (c) Award fee incentives shall not be used with a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.

        1816.405-271   Base fee.

#### § 1816.405-271

        (a) A base fee shall not be used on CPAF contracts for which the periodic award fee evaluations are final (1816.405-273(a)). In these circumstances, contractor performance during any award fee period is independent of and has no effect on subsequent performance periods or the final results at contract completion. For other contracts, such as those for hardware or software development, the procurement officer may authorize the use of a base fee not to exceed 3 percent. Base fee shall not be used when an award fee incentive is used in conjunction with another contract type ( CPIF/AF).

        (b) When a base fee is authorized for use in a CPAF contract, it shall be paid only if the final award fee evaluation is “satisfactory” or better. ( 1816.405-273 and 1816.405-275) Pending final evaluation, base fee may be paid during the life of the contract at defined intervals on a provisional basis. If the final award fee evaluation is “unsatisfactory”, all provisional base fee payments shall be refunded to the Government.

> [76 FR 6697, Feb. 8, 2011]

        1816.405-272   Award fee evaluation periods.

#### § 1816.405-272

        (a) Award fee evaluation periods, including those for interim evaluations, should be at least 6 months in length. When appropriate, the procurement officer may authorize shorter evaluation periods after ensuring that the additional administrative costs associated with the shorter periods are offset by benefits accruing to the Government. Where practicable, such as developmental contracts with defined performance milestones (e.g., Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, initial system test), establishing evaluation periods at conclusion of the milestones rather than calendar dates, or in combination with calendar dates should be considered. In no case shall an evaluation period be longer than 12 months.

        (b) A portion of the total available award fee contract shall be allocated to each of the evaluation periods. This allocation may result in an equal or unequal distribution of fee among the periods. The contracting officer shall consider the nature of each contract and the incentive effects of fee distribution in determining the appropriate allocation structure.

> [62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated at 62 FR 36706, July 9, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 13133, Mar. 18, 1998; 80 FR 12937, Mar. 12, 2015]

        1816.405-273   Award fee evaluations.

#### § 1816.405-273

        (a)  On contracts where the contract deliverable is the performance of a service over any given time period, contractor performance is definitively measurable within each evaluation period. In these cases, all evaluations are final, and the contractor keeps the fee earned in any period regardless of the evaluations of subsequent periods. Unearned award fee in any given period in a service contract is lost and shall not be carried forward, or “rolled-over,” into subsequent periods.

        (b)  On contracts, such as those for end item deliverables, where the true quality of contractor performance cannot be measured until the end of the contract, only the last evaluation is final. At that point, the total contract award fee pool is available, and the contractor's total performance is evaluated against the award fee plan to determine total earned award fee. In addition to the final evaluation, interim evaluations are done to monitor performance prior to contract completion, provide feedback to the contractor on the Government's assessment of the quality of its performance, and establish the basis for making interim award fee payments (see 1816.405-276(a)). These interim evaluations and associated interim award fee payments are superseded by the fee determination made in the final evaluation at contract completion. However, if the final award fee adjectival rating is higher or lower than the average adjectival rating of all the interim award fee periods, or if the final award fee score is eight base percentage points higher or lower than the average award fee score of all interim award fee periods ( 80% to 88%), then the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) or the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer (if the HCA is the Fee Determination Official) shall review and concur in the final award fee determination. The Government will then pay the contractor, or the contractor will refund to the Government, the difference between the final award fee determination and the cumulative interim fee payments.

        (c)  Interim and final evaluations may be used to provide past performance information during the source selection process in future acquisitions and should be marked and controlled as “Source Selection Information—see FAR 3.104”. See FAR 42.1503(h) regarding the requirements for releasing Source Selection Information included in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

> [63 FR 13133, Mar. 18, 1998, as amended at 80 FR 12937, Mar. 12, 2015; 81 FR 50366, Aug. 1, 2016]

        1816.405-274   Award fee evaluation factors.

#### § 1816.405-274

        (a) Explicit evaluation factors shall be established for each award fee period. Factors shall be linked to acquisition objectives which shall be defined in terms of contract cost, schedule, and technical performance. If used, subfactors should be limited to the minimum necessary to ensure a thorough evaluation and an effective incentive.

        (b) Evaluation factors will be developed by the contracting officer based upon the characteristics of an individual procurement. Cost control, schedule, and technical performance considerations shall be included as evaluation factors in all CPAF contracts, as applicable. When explicit evaluation factor weightings are used, cost control shall be no less than 25 percent of the total weighted evaluation factors. The predominant consideration of the cost control evaluation should be a measurement of the contractor's performance against the negotiated estimated cost of the contract. This estimated cost may include the value of undefinitized change orders when appropriate.

        (c)(1) The technical factor must include consideration of risk management (including mission success, safety, security, health, export control, and damage to the environment, as appropriate) unless waived at a level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of the project manager. The rationale for any waiver shall be documented in the contract file. When safety, export control, or security are considered under the technical factor, the award fee plan shall allow the following fee determinations, regardless of contractor performance in other evaluation factors, when there is a major breach of safety or security.

        (i) For evaluation of service contracts under 1816.405-273(a), an overall fee rating of unsatisfactory for any evaluation period in which there is a major breach of safety or security.

        (ii) For evaluation of end item contracts under 1816.405-273(b), an overall fee rating of unsatisfactory for any interim evaluation period in which there is a major breach of safety or security. To ensure that the final award fee evaluation at contract completion reflects any major breach of safety or security, in an interim period, the overall award fee pool shall be reduced by the amount of the fee available for the period in which the major breach occurred if an unsatisfactory fee rating was assigned because of a major breach of safety or security.

        (2) A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any “willful” or “repeat” violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.

        (3) A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be directly related to the work on the contract. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the contractor that results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.

        (4) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement shall be notified prior to the determination of an unsatisfactory award fee rating because of a major breach of safety or security.

        (d) In rare circumstances, contract costs may increase for reasons outside the contractor's control and for which the contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment. One example is a weather-related launch delay on a launch support contract. The Government shall take such situations into consideration when evaluating contractor cost control.

        (e) Emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other performance requirement objectives. The contractor should not be incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall performance is significantly degraded. For example, incentivizing an underrun that results in direct negative impacts on technical performance, safety, or other critical contract objectives is both undesirable and counterproductive. Therefore, evaluation of cost control shall conform to the following guidelines:

        (1) Normally, the contractor should be given an unsatisfactory rating for cost control when there is a significant overrun within its control. However, the contractor may receive a satisfactory or higher rating for cost control if the overrun is insignificant. Award fee ratings should decrease sharply as the size of the overrun increases. In any evaluation of contractor overrun performance, the Government shall consider the reasons for the overrun and assess the extent and effectiveness of the contractor's efforts to control or mitigate the overrun.

        (2) The contractor should normally be rewarded for an underrun within its control, up to the maximum award fee rating allocated for cost control, provided the adjectival rating for all other award fee evaluation factors is very good or higher ( FAR 16.401(e)(iv)).

        (3) The contractor should be rewarded for meeting the estimated cost of the contract, but not to the maximum rating allocated for cost control, to the degree that the contractor has prudently managed costs while meeting contract requirements. No award fee shall be given in this circumstance unless the average adjectival rating for all other award fee evaluation factors is satisfactory or higher.

        (f) When an AF arrangement is used in conjunction with another contract type, the award fee's cost control factor will only apply to a subjective assessment of the contractor's efforts to control costs and not the actual cost outcome incentivized under the basic contract type ( CPIF, FPIF).

        (g)(1) The contractor's performance against the subcontracting plan incorporated in the contract shall be evaluated. Emphasis may be placed on the contractor's accomplishment of its goals for subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities—Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs). The evaluation should consider both goals as a percentage of subcontracting dollars as well as a percentage of the total contract value.

        (2) The contractor's achievements in subcontracting high technology efforts as well as the contractor's performance under the Mentor-Protégé Program, if applicable, may also be evaluated.

        (3) The evaluation weight given to the contractor's performance against the considerations in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section shall be 10 percent of available award fee and shall be separate from all other factors.

        (h) When contract changes are anticipated, the contractor's responsiveness to requests for change proposals should be evaluated. This evaluation should include the contractor's submission of timely, complete proposals and cooperation in negotiating the change.

        (i) Only the award fee performance evaluation factors set forth in the performance evaluation plan shall be used to determine award fee scores.

        (j) The Government may unilaterally modify the applicable award fee performance evaluation factors and performance evaluation areas prior to the start of an evaluation period. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor in writing of any such changes 30 days prior to the start of the relevant evaluation period.

#### § 1816.405-275

        (a) All award fee contracts shall utilize the adjectival rating categories and associated descriptions as well as the award fee pool available to be earned percentages for each adjectival rating category contained in FAR 16.401(e)(3)(iv). Contracting officers may supplement these descriptions with more specifics relative to their procurement but they cannot alter or delete the FAR adjectival rating descriptions.

        (b) The following numerical scoring system shall be used in conjunction with the FAR adjectival rating categories and associated descriptions (see FAR 16401(e)(3)(iv)).

        (1)  (100-91)

        (2)  (90-76)

        (3)  (75-51)

        (4)  (50)

        (5)  (less than 50) No award fee shall be paid for an unsatisfactory rating.

        (c) As a benchmark for evaluation, in order to be rated “Excellent” overall, the contractor would typically be under cost, on or ahead of schedule, and providing outstanding technical performance.

        (d) A weighted scoring system appropriate for the circumstances of the individual contract requirement should be developed. In this system, each evaluation factor ( technical, schedule, cost control) is assigned a specific percentage weighting with the cumulative weightings of all factors totaling 100. During the award fee evaluation, each factor is scored from 0-100 according to the ratings defined in 1816.405-275(b). The numerical score for each factor is then multiplied by the weighting for that factor to determine the weighted score. For example, if the technical factor has a weighting of 60 percent and the numerical score for that factor is 80, the weighted technical score is 48 (80 × 60 percent). The weighted scores for each evaluation factor are then added to determine the total award fee score.

        1816.405-276   Award fee payments and limitations.

#### § 1816.405-276

        (a)  The amount of an interim award fee payment (see 1816.405-273(b)) is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent of the fee allocated to that interim period less any provisional payments (see paragraph (b) of this subsection) made during the period.

        (b)  Provisional award fee payments are payments made within evaluation periods prior to an interim or final evaluation for that period. Provisional payments may be included in the contract and should be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. For a service contract, the total amount of award fee available in an evaluation period that may be provisionally paid is the lesser of a percentage stipulated in the contract (but not exceeding 80 percent) or the prior period's evaluation score. For an end item contract, the total amount of provisional payments in a period is limited to a percentage not to exceed 80 percent of the prior interim period's evaluation score, except for the first evaluation period which is limited to 80 percent of the available award fee for that evaluation period.

        (c)  The Fee Determination Official's rating for both interim and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. Any fee, interim or final, due the contractor will be paid no later than 60 calendar days after the end of the period being evaluated.

        1816.405-277   Award term.

#### § 1816.405-277

        (a) An award term enables a contractor to become eligible for additional periods of performance or ordering periods under a service contract (as defined in FAR 37.101) by achieving and sustaining the prescribed performance levels under the contract. It incentivizes the contractor for maintaining superior performance by providing an opportunity for extensions of the contract term.

        (b) Award terms are best suited for acquisitions where a longer term relationship (generally more than five years) between the Government and a contractor would provide significant benefits to both. Motivating excellent performance, fostering contractor capital investment, and increasing the desirability of the award, thus potentially increasing competition, are benefits that may justify the use of award terms.

        (c) While the administrative burden and cost of more frequent procurements to both the Government and potential offerors should be considered when determining whether to use award terms, this decision must be weighed against market stability, the potential changes and advancements in technology, and flexibility to change direction with mission changes and associated frequent procurements.

        (d) Award terms may be used in conjunction with contract options under FAR 17.2. Award terms are similar to contract options in that they are conditioned on the Government's continuing need for the contract and the availability of funds. However, FAR 17.207(c)(7) states the contracting officer must determine that the contractor's performance has been acceptable,  received satisfactory ratings. In contrast, to become eligible for an award term, the contractor must maintain a level of performance above acceptable as specified in the Award Term Plan (see 1816.405-277(i)). In contracts with both option periods and award terms, the award term period of performance or ordering period shall begin after completion of any option period of performance or ordering period.

        (e) Contracts with award terms shall include a base period of performance or ordering period and may include a designated number of option periods during which the Government will observe and evaluate the contractor's performance allowing the contractor to earn an award term. Additionally, as specified in the Award Term Plan, the contractor may also be evaluated for additional award terms during performance of an earned award term. If the contractor meets or exceeds the performance requirements, there is an on-going need for and desire to continue the contract, funds are available, and the contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions, then the contractor may be eligible for contract extension for the period of the award term.

        (f) Contracts with award terms shall comply with FAR and NFS restrictions on the overall contract length, such as the 5-year period of performance limitation found at NFS 1817.204.

        (g) Award terms may only be used in acquisitions for services exceeding $20 million dollars. Use of award terms for lower-valued acquisitions may be authorized in exceptional situations such as contract requirements having direct health or safety impacts, where the judgmental assessment of the quality of contractor performance is critical.

        (h) Consistent with the Competition in Contracting Act and general procurement principles, the potential award term periods in a procurement must be priced, evaluated, and considered in the initial contract selection process in order to be valid.

        (i) All contracts including award terms shall be supported by an Award Term Plan that establishes criteria for earning an award term and the methodology and schedule for evaluating contractor performance. A copy of the Award Term Plan shall be included in the contract. The contracting officer may unilaterally revise the Award Term Plan. Award Term Plans shall—

        (1) Identify the officials to include Term-Determining Official involved in the award term evaluation and their function;

        (2) Identify and describe each evaluation factor, any subfactors, related performance standards, adjectival ratings, and numerical ranges or weights to be used. The contracting officer should follow the guidance at 1816.405-274 in establishing award term evaluation factors and 1816.405-275 in establishing adjectival rating categories, associated descriptions, numerical scoring system, and weighted scoring system;

        (3) Specify the annual overall rating required for the contractor to be eligible for an award term that reflects a level of performance above acceptable and the number of award terms the contractor may qualify for based on the rating score;

        (4) Identify the evaluation period(s) and the evaluation schedule to be conducted at stated intervals during the contract period of performance or ordering period so that the contractor will periodically be informed of the quality of its performance and the areas in which improvement is expected ( six months, nine months, twelve months, or at other specific milestones), and when the decision points are for the determination that the contractor is eligible for an award term; and

        (5) Identify the contract's base period of performance or ordering period, any option period(s), and total award-term periods(s). Award term periods shall not exceed one year.

        (j)(1) The Government has the unilateral right not to grant or to cancel award term periods and the associated Award Term Plans if—

        (i) The contractor has failed to achieve the required performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period;

        (ii) After earning an award term, the contractor fails to earn an award term in any succeeding year of contract performance, the contracting officer may cancel any award terms that the contractor has earned, but that have not begun;

        (iii) The contracting officer notifies the contractor that the Government no longer has a need for the award term period before the time an award term period is to begin;

        (iv) The contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of the contract, the contract was set-aside for small businesses, and the contractor rerepresents in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, that it is no longer a small business; or

        (v) The contracting officer notifies the contractor that funds are not available for the award term.

        (2) When an award term period is not granted or cancelled, any—

        (i) Prior award term periods for which the contractor remains otherwise eligible are unaffected.

        (ii) Subsequent award term periods are also cancelled.

        (k) Cancellation of an award term period that has not yet commenced for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (j) of this section shall not be considered either a termination for convenience or termination for default, and shall not entitle the contractor to any termination settlement or any other compensation. If the award term is cancelled, a unilateral modification will cite the clause as the authority.

        (a) This subpart implements the NASA Mentor-Protégé Program (hereafter referred to as the Program) as authorized by the Small Business Administration in accordance with 13 CFR 125.10. The purpose of the program is to:

        (1) Provide incentives to NASA contractors, performing under at least one active, approved subcontracting plan negotiated with NASA, to assist protégés in enhancing their capabilities to perform as viable NASA contractors, other Government contractors, and commercial suppliers on contract and subcontract requirements.

        (2) Increase the overall participation of protégés as subcontractors and suppliers under NASA contracts, other Federal agency contracts, and commercial contracts; and

        (3) Foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between protégés and mentors.

        (b) Under the Program, eligible entities approved as mentors will enter into mentor-protégé agreements (MPA) with eligible protégés to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protégés to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. NASA may provide the mentor award fee incentives. Additionally, this subpart explains the calculated subcontracting credit for a mentor-protégé program pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

        (1) A large business prime contractor or research institution performing with at least one approved subcontracting plan (other than a commercial plan) negotiated with NASA, pursuant to FAR subpart 19.7. A contractor may apply to become a mentor if they currently are not performing under a NASA contract, as long as they are currently performing another Federal agency contract with an approved subcontracting plan. However, the NASA MPA will not be approved until the mentor company is performing under a NASA contract with an approved subcontracting plan.

        (2) Eligible for receipt of Government contracts. An entity will not be approved for participation in the program if, at the time of submission of the application to the NASA Mentor Protégé Program Office (MPPO), the entity is debarred or suspended from contracting with the Federal Government pursuant to FAR subpart 9.4.

        (b) To be eligible to participate as a protégé, an entity must be eligible for award of Federal contracts in accordance with FAR subpart 9.4,  entities cannot be suspended or debarred at the time of application for the program and must be classified as one of more of the following entities or socio-economic categories as defined by FAR part 2:

        (1) Small disadvantaged business;

        (2) Women-owned small or economically disadvantaged women-owned concern;

        (3) Veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern;

        (4) Historically underutilized business zone concern;

        (5) Historically Black College and University or Minority-Serving Institution;

        (6) Current NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Company; or

        (7) An entity participating in the AbilityOne Program.

        (c) A protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements.

      Subpart 1819.73—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs

        1819.7301   Scope of subpart.

#### § 1819.7301

        The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs were established and issued under the authority of the Small Business Act codified at 15 U.S.C. 631, as amended, and the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-219), codified with amendments at 15 U.S.C. 638, as amended. The Small Business Act requires that the Small Business Administration (SBA) issue SBIR and STTR Program Policy Directives for the general conduct of the SBIR/STTR Programs within the Federal Government. The statutory purpose of the SBIR Program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development (R/R&D). Specific program purposes are to: Stimulate technological innovation; use small business to meet Federal R/R&D needs; foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged SBCs, and by SBCs that are 51-percent owned and controlled by women, in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R/R&D, thereby increasing competition, productivity and economic growth. Federal agencies participating in the SBIR/STTR Programs (SBIR/STTR agencies) are obligated to follow the guidance provided by the SBA Policy Directive. NASA is required to ensure its policies, regulations, and guidance on the SBIR/STTR Programs are consistent with SBA's Policy Directive. Contracting officers are required to insert the applicable clauses identified in 1819.7302 in all SBIR and STTR contracts.

#### § 1825.1103

        1825.1103-70   Export control.

#### § 1825.1103-70

        (a)  (1) NASA contractors and subcontractors are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR parts 730 through 799. The contractor is responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals from the Department of State or the Department of Commerce when it exports hardware, technical data, or software, or provides technical assistance to a foreign destination or “foreign person”, as defined in 22 CFR 120.16, and there are no applicable or available exemptions/exceptions to the ITAR/EAR, respectively. A person who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States is not a “foreign person”. (See 22 CFR 120.16 and 15 CFR 734.2(b)(2)(ii))

        (2) The exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) of the ITAR provides that a contractor may export technical data without a license if the contract between the agency and the exporter provides for the export of the data. The clause at 1852.225-70, Alternate I, provides contractual authority for the exemption, but the exemption is available only after the contracting officer, or designated representative, provides written authorization or direction enabling its use. It is NASA policy that the exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) may only be used when technical data (including software) is exchanged with a NASA foreign partner pursuant to the terms of an international agreement in furtherance of an international collaborative effort. The contracting officer must obtain the approval of the Center Export Administrator before granting the contractor the authority to use this exemption.

        (b)  Insert the clause at 1852.225-70, Export Licenses, in all solicitations and contracts, except in contracts with foreign entities. Insert the clause with its Alternate I when the NASA project office indicates that technical data (including software) is to be exchanged by the contractor with a NASA foreign partner pursuant to an international agreement.

#### § 1825.003-70

      “Canadian end product”, for an item with an estimated value of $25,000 or less, means an unmanufactured end product mined or produced in Canada or an end product manufactured in Canada, if the cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in Canada or the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. The cost of components includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product. For an end product with an estimated value in excess of $25,000, the definition at FAR 25.003 applies.

        1827.302   Policy.

#### § 1827.302

        (a)  NASA policy with respect to any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation made in the performance of work under any NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and the allocation of related property rights is based upon Section 20135 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135) (the Act); and, to the extent consistent with this statute, the Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, and Section 1(b)(4) of Executive Order 12591. NASA contractors subject to Section 20135 of the Act shall ensure the prompt reporting of reportable items in order to protect the Government's interest and to provide the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and commercial communities and the general public.

        (b)  (1) For NASA contracts, the contractor right to elect title under the FAR only applies to contracts with small businesses and nonprofit organizations. For other business entities, see paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section;

        (2)(v) Under any NASA contract with other than a small business or nonprofit organization ( contracts subject to section 20135(b) of the Act), title to subject inventions vests in NASA when the determinations of section 20135(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) have been made. The Administrator may grant the contractor a waiver of title in accordance with 14 CFR part 1245.

        (3)  The Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made in the performance of NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served. The procedures and instructions for contractors to submit petitions for waiver of rights in subject inventions are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1,  Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for any subject invention or class of subject inventions or during contract performance for individually identified subject inventions reported under the contract. For individual identified subject inventions, the petition shall identify each invention with particularity ( by NASA's assigned number to the Disclosure of Invention and New Technology report or by title and inventorship). For advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention or class of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver is being requested. To meet the statutory standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” the petition must be directed to a single invention or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly-drawn, focused area of technology. When a waiver of title is granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by the Government, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver, such as requirements for reporting and filing patent applications on waived inventions, are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.

        (c)  For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the Administrator shall reserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign Government in accordance with any treaty or agreement of the United States.

        (e)  For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the requirements for utilization reports shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.

        (f)  For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, march-in rights shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.

        (g)  For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, waiver of the requirement for substantial manufacture in the United States shall be in accordance with Title 35 of the United States Code, section 204.

        (i)  (1) For NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, where title to any subject inventions vests in NASA, the contractor is normally granted, in accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR 1245.108, a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The license extends to any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure, and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right are transferable only with the approval of the Administrator, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

        (2) The procedures for revoking or modifying the license to a contractor that is other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization are described in 14 CFR 1245.108.

        (k)  It is the policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, when referred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board in accordance with 14 CFR part 1240, subpart 1, any subject invention reported to NASA in accordance with this subpart, and for which an application for patent has been filed.

        1827.303   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

        (3) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.227-72, Designation of New Technology Representative and Patent Representative, in all solicitations and contracts containing either of the clauses at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor, or 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). It may also be inserted, upon consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, in solicitations and contracts using another patent rights clause. The center New Technology and Patent Representatives are identified at

        (e)(1) When work is to be performed outside the United States by contractors that are not domestic firms, the clause at 1852.227-85, Invention Reporting and Rights—Foreign, shall be used unless the contracting officer determines, with concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, that the objectives of the contract would be better served by use of the clause at FAR 52.227-13, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Government. For this purpose, the contracting officer may presume that a contractor is not a domestic firm unless it is known that the firm is not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced. (See FAR 27.304-3 regarding subcontracts with U.S. firms.)

        (2) When one of the conditions in FAR 27.303(e)(1)(i) through (iv) is met, the contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel to determine the appropriate clause.

      Subpart 1827.4—Rights in Data and Copyrights

        1827.404   Basic rights in data clause.

#### § 1827.404

        1827.404-4   Contractor's release, publication, and use of data.

#### § 1827.404-4

        (b)(1) NASA's intent is to ensure the most expeditious dissemination of computer software developed by it or its contractor. Accordingly, when the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, is modified by 1852.227-14 (see 1827.409(b)(1)), the contractor shall not assert claim to copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first produced in the performance of a contract without the contracting officer's prior written permission. The prohibition on “release to others” does not prohibit release to another Federal Agency for its use or its contractors' use, as long as any such release is consistent with any restrictive markings on the software. Any restrictive markings on the software shall take precedence over the aforementioned release. Any such release to a Federal Agency in accordance with this paragraph shall limit use to the Federal Agency or its contractors for Government purposes only.

        (2) The contracting officer may, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, grant the contractor permission to assert claim to copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first produced in the performance of a contract if:

        (i) The contractor has identified an existing commercial computer software product line or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that line, either directly itself or through a licensee;

        (ii) The contractor has identified an existing open source software project or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that project, or has been instructed by the Agency to incorporate software first produced under the contract into an open source software project or otherwise release the software as open source software;

        (iii) The contractor has made, or will be required to make, substantial contributions to the development of the computer software by co-funding or by cost-sharing, or by contributing resources (including but not limited to agreement to provide continuing maintenance and update of the software at no cost for Governmental use); or

        (iv) The concurrence of the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property, or designee, is obtained.

        (c)(1) The contractor's request for permission in accordance with 1827.404-4(b) may be made either before contract award or during contract performance.

        (2)(i) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is subsection (i), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances that the computer software will be incorporated into an existing or proposed new commercial computer software product line within a specified reasonable time, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain the right to distribute the software for commercial use, including the right to obtain assignment of copyright where applicable, in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

        (ii) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(ii), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances that the computer software will be incorporated into an existing or proposed new open source project within a specified reasonable time, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain the right to distribute the software for open source development, including the right to obtain assignment of copyright where applicable, in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

        (iii) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(iii), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification that contains appropriate assurances that the agreed contributions to the Government are fulfilled, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain assignment of copyright if such contributions do not occur in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

        (iv) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(iv), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances as required by the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property, or designee, including at the very least the right to obtain assignment of copyright in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

        (3) When any permission to copyright is granted, any copyright license retained by the Government shall be of the same scope as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 and without any obligation of confidentiality on the part of the Government unless, in accordance with 1827.404-4(b)(2)(iii), the contributions of the Contractor are considered “substantial” for the purposes of FAR 27.408 ( approximately 50 percent), in which case rights consistent with FAR 27.408 may be negotiated for the computer software in question.

        (d) If the contractor has not been granted permission to assert claim to copyright, paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General (as modified by 1852.227-14) enables NASA to direct the contractor to assert claim to copyright in computer software first produced under the contract and to assign, or obtain the assignment of, such copyright to the Government or its designated assignee. The contracting officer may, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, so direct the contractor in situations where copyright protection is considered necessary in furtherance of Agency mission objectives, needed to support specific Agency programs, or necessary to meet statutory requirements.

        1827.409   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 1827.409

        (b)(1) When the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, is included in a solicitation or contract, it shall be modified as set forth at 1852.227-14. In contracts for basic or applied research to be performed solely by universities and colleges, the contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the addition of subparagraph (4) as set forth at 1852.227-14 to paragraph (d) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 and they will consider the guidance provided at FAR 27.404-4.

        (2) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority for use of Alternate I of the clause at FAR 52.227-14. An example of its use is where the principal purpose of the contract (such as a contract for basic or applied research) does not involve the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes that are intended to be acquired for use by or for the Government (either under the contract in question or under any anticipated follow-on contracts relating to the same subject matter).

        (3) The contracting officer shall review the disclosure purposes listed in FAR 27.404-2(c)(1)(i) through (v) and, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, determine which disclosure purposes apply based on the nature of the acquisition, and add them to paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General. If none apply, the CO shall insert “none”. Additions to those specific purposes listed may be made only with the approval of the procurement officer and concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel.

        (4) The contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the acquisition of restricted computer software with greater or lesser rights than those set forth in Alternate III of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General. Where it is impractical to actually modify the notice of Alternate III, such greater or lesser rights may be indicated by express reference in a separate clause in the contract or by a collateral agreement that addresses the change in the restricted rights.

        (5) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority for the use of Alternate IV in any contract other than a contract for basic or applied research to be performed solely by a college or university (but not for the management or operation of Government facilities). See the guidance at FAR 27.404-3(a)(3).

        (d) The clause at 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be used in all solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed under a contract solely by a university or college when the contract amount will be $500,000 or less), unless after consultation between the Contracting Officer and the center patent or intellectual property counsel a determination is made otherwise.

        (g) The contracting officer shall use the clause at 1852.227-86, Commercial Computer Software License, in lieu of FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when it is considered appropriate for the acquisition of existing computer software.

        (h) Normally the clause at 52.227-20, Rights in Data—SBIR Program, is the only data rights clause used in SBIR contracts. However, if during the performance of an SBIR contract (Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III) the need arises for NASA to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software as defined in the clause at FAR 52.227-20, and the contractor agrees to such delivery, the limited rights data or restricted computer software may be acquired by modification of the contract (for example, by adding the clause at FAR 52.227-14 with any appropriate Alternates and making it applicable only to the limited rights data or restricted computer software to be delivered), using the rights and related restrictions as set forth in FAR 27.404-2 as a guide.

        (i) [Reserved]

        (k)(i) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (e) as set forth in 1852.227-19(a) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when it is contemplated that updates, correction notices, consultation information, and other similar items of information relating to commercial computer software delivered under a purchase order or contract are available and their receipt can be facilitated by signing a vendor supplied agreement, registration forms, or cards and returning them directly to the vendor.

        (ii) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (f) as set forth at 1852.227-19(b) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when portions of a contractor's standard commercial license or lease agreement consistent with the clause, Federal laws, standard industry practices, and the FAR are to be incorporated into the purchase order or contract.

        (m)(1) The contracting officer, shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel and the installation software release authority to determine when to use the clause at 1852.227-88, Government-furnished computer software and related technical data.

        (2) The clause may be included in, or added to, the contract when it is contemplated that computer software and related technical data will be provided to the contractor as Government-furnished information for use in performing the contract.

        (a) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 1852.228-71, Aircraft Flight Risks, in all cost-reimbursement contracts for the development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul of aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the contractor, except when the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment.

        (b) The contracting officer must insert the provision at 1852.228-80, Insurance—Immunity from Tort Liability, in solicitations for research and development when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated.

        (c) The contracting officer must insert FAR clause 52.228-7 and the associated clause at 1852.228-81, Insurance—Partial Immunity From Tort Liability, when the successful offeror represents in its offer that the offeror is partially immune from tort liability as a State agency or as a charitable institution.

        (d) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 1852.228-82, Insurance—Total Immunity From Tort Liability, when the successful offeror represents in its offer that the offeror is totally immune from tort liability as a State agency or as a charitable institution.

        1828.370   Fixed-price contract clauses.

#### § 1828.370

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-70, Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk, in all negotiated fixed-price contracts for the development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul of aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the contractor, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment. See the clause preface for directions for modifying the clause to accommodate various circumstances.

        (b) The Government need not assume the risk of aircraft damage, loss, or destruction as provided by the clause at 1852.228-70 if the best estimate of premium costs that would be included in the contract price for insurance coverage for such damage, loss, or destruction at any plant or facility is less than $500. If it is determined not to assume this risk, the clause at 1852.228-70 shall not be made a part of the contract, and the cost of necessary insurance to be obtained by the contractor to cover this risk shall be considered in establishing the contract price. In such cases, however, if performance of the contract is expected to involve the flight of Government-furnished aircraft, the substance of the clause at 1852.228-71, Aircraft Flight Risks, suitably adapted for use in a fixed-price contract, shall be used.

        (c) When the clause at 1852.228-70 is used, the term “Contractor's premises” shall be expressly defined in the contract Schedule and shall be limited to places where aircraft may be located during the performance of the contract. Contractor's premises may include, but are not limited to, those owned or leased by the contractor or those for which the contractor has a permit, license, or other right of use either exclusively or jointly with others, including Government airfields.

        1828.371   Clauses incorporating cross-waivers of liability for International Space Station activities and Science or Space Exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station.

#### § 1828.371

        (a) In contracts covering International Space Station activities, or Science or Space Exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station that involve a launch, NASA shall require the contractor to agree to waive all claims against any entity or person defined in the clause based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waivers will require the contractor to extend the cross-waiver provisions to their subcontractors at any tier and related entities ensuring those subcontractors and related entities also waive all claims against any entity or person defined in the clause for damages arising out of Protected Space Operations. The purpose of the clauses prescribed in this section is to extend the cross-waivers under other agreements to NASA contractors that perform work in support of NASA's obligations under these agreements.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-78, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Science or Space Exploration Activities unrelated to the International Space Station, in solicitations and contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold for the acquisition of launches for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station or for acquisitions for science or space exploration activities that are not related to the International Space Station but involve a launch. If a science or space exploration activity is in support of the International Space Station, the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section and designate its application to that particular launch.

        (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-76, Cross-Waiver of Liability for International Space Station Activities, in solicitations and contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold when the work to be performed involves Protected Space Operations, as that term is defined in the clause, relating to the International Space Station.

        (d) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be used in solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions to existing contracts under the simplified acquisition threshold involving science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station, or International Space Station activities, respectively, in appropriate circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the value of contractor property on a Government installation used in performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that the contractor or subcontractor will have its valuable property exposed to risk or damage caused by other participants in the science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station, or International Space Station activities.

        1828.372   Clause for minimum insurance coverage.

#### § 1828.372

        In accordance with FAR 28.306(b) and 28.307, the contracting officer may insert a clause substantially as stated at 1852.228-75, Minimum Insurance Coverage, in fixed-price solicitations and in cost-reimbursement contracts. The contracting officer may modify the clause to require additional coverage, such as vessel liability, and higher limits if appropriate for a particular acquisition.

#### § 1830.7001-4

        (a)  (1) The contractor may include FCCOM in cost reimbursement and progress payment invoices. To determine the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the incurred portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest available cost of money factors. These FCCOM calculations are interim estimates subject to adjustment.

        (2) As actual cost of money factors are finalized, use the new factors to calculate FCCOM for the next accounting period.

        (b)  (1) Contract FCCOM for final cost determination or repricing is based on each year's final cost of money factors determined under CAS 414 and supported by separate Forms CASB-CMF.

        (2) Separately compute contract FCCOM in a manner similar to yearly final overhead rates. As in overhead rates, include in the final settlement an adjustment from interim to final contract FCCOM. Do not adjust the contract estimated or target cost.

#### § 1830.7002-1

        (a)  is either—

        (1) The interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or

        (2) The time-weighted average of such rates for each cost accounting period during which the capital asset is being constructed, fabricated, or developed.

        (b)  is the calculated amount considered invested by the contractor during the cost accounting period to construct, fabricate, or develop the capital asset.

        1830.7002-2   Cost of money calculations.

#### § 1830.7002-2

        (a) The interest rate referenced in 1830.7002-1(a)(1) is established semi-annually and published in the  during the fourth week of December and June.

        (b) To calculate the time-weighted average interest rate referenced in 1830.7002-1(a)(2), multiply the rates in effect during the months of construction by the number of months each rate was in effect, and then divide the sum of the products by the total number of months.

        1830.7002-3   Representative investment calculations.

#### § 1830.7002-3

        (a) The calculation of the representative investment requires consideration of the rate or expenditure pattern of the costs to construct, fabricate, or develop a capital asset.

        (b) If the majority of the costs were incurred toward the beginning, middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor shall either:

        (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting period by calculating the average of the month-end balances for that cost accounting period; or

        (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investments.

        (c) If the costs were incurred in a fairly uniform expenditure pattern throughout the construction, fabrication, or development period, the contractor may either:

        (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting period by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the construction, fabrication, or development cost account for the cost accounting period; or

        (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investments.

        (d) The method chosen by the contractor to determine the representative investment amount may be different for each capital asset being constructed, fabricated, or developed, provided the method fits the expenditure pattern of the costs incurred.

        1830.7002-4   Determining imputed cost of money.

#### § 1830.7002-4

        (a) Determine the imputed cost of money for an asset under construction, fabrication, or development by applying a cost of money rate (see 1830.7002-2) to the representative investment (see 1830.7002-3).

        (1) When a representative investment is determined for a cost accounting period in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(1) or 1830.7002-3(c)(1), the cost of money rate shall be the time-weighted average rate.

        (2) When a monthly representative investment is used in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(2) or 1830.7002-3(c)(2), the cost of money rate shall be that in effect each month. Under this method, the FCCOM is determined monthly, and the total for the cost accounting period is the sum of the monthly calculations.

        (b) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any cost accounting period, either at the end of the accounting period or the end of the construction, fabrication, or development period, whichever comes first.

        (c) When the construction, fabrication, or development of an asset takes more than one accounting period, the cost of money capitalized for the first accounting period will be included in determining the representative investment for any future cost accounting periods.

      Subpart 1834.2—Earned Value Management System

        1834.201   Policy.

#### § 1834.201

        (a) NASA requires use of an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) on contracts for development or production work, including development or production work for flight and ground support systems and components, prototypes, and institutional investments (facilities, IT infrastructure, etc.) as specified below:

        (1) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $50 Million or more the contractor shall have an EVMS that has been determined by the cognizant Federal agency to be in compliance with the guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748).

        (2) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $20 Million or more but less than $50 Million, the contractor shall have an EVMS that complies with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748, as determined by the cognizant Contracting Officer.

        (3) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20 Million the application of Earned Value Management (EVM) is optional and is a risk-based decision at the discretion of the program/project manager.

        (b) Requiring EVM for firm-fixed-price (FFP) contracts and subcontracts of any dollar value is discouraged; however, an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and adequate reporting shall be required to plan and track schedule performance for development or production contracts valued at $20 Million or more. In addition, for FFP contracts that are part of a program/project of $50 Million or more, the contracting officer shall collaborate with the government's program/project manager to ensure the appropriate data can be obtained or generated to fulfill program management needs and comply with NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7120.5.

        (c) An EVMS is not required on non-developmental contracts for engineering support services, steady state operations, basic and applied research, and routine services such as janitorial services or grounds maintenance services.

        (d) Contracting officers shall request the assistance of the cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) office and the applicable NASA Center EVM Focal Point () in determining the adequacy of proposed EVMS plans and procedures and system compliance.

        (e) Notwithstanding the EVMS requirements above, if an offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the ANSI/EIA Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards, as specified in 1852.234-1, Notice of Earned Value Management System. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards.

        (f) As a minimum, and in accordance with NPD 7120.5, requirements initiators shall ensure that EVMS monthly reports are included as a deliverable in the acquisition package provided to the procurement office for implementation into contracts where EVMS applies. Additionally, the acquisition package shall include a Contract Performance Report (CPR), IMS and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the appropriate data requirements descriptions (DRDs) for implementation into the contract.

      1835.016-70   Foreign participation under broad agency announcements (BAAs).

#### § 1835.016-70

      (a)  (1) NASA seeks the broadest participation in response to broad agency announcements, including foreign proposals or proposals including foreign participation. NASA's policy is to conduct research with foreign entities on a cooperative, no-exchange-of-funds basis (see NPD 1360.2, Initiation and Development of International Cooperation in Space and Aeronautics Programs). NASA does not normally fund foreign research proposals or foreign research efforts that are part of U.S. research proposals. Rather, cooperative research efforts are implemented via international agreements between NASA and the sponsoring foreign agency or funding/sponsoring institution under which the parties agree to each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.

      (2) In accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy, use of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is permitted only on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.

      (3) NASA funding may not be used for subcontracted foreign research efforts. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do not constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S. award recipients is permitted.

      1835.016-71   NASA Research Announcements.

#### § 1835.016-71

      (a) Scope. An NRA is used to announce research interests in support of NASA's programs, and, after peer or scientific review using factors in the NRA, select proposals for funding. Unlike an RFP containing a statement of work or specification to which offerors are to respond, an NRA provides for the submission of competitive project ideas, conceived by the offerors, in one or more program areas of interest. An NRA shall not be used when the requirement is sufficiently defined to specify an end product or service.

      (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-73, Final Scientific and Technical Reports, in all research and development contracts, and in interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving research and development work.

      (1) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence of the program or project manager and the center Export Control Administrator, shall insert the clause with its Alternate I when the contract includes “fundamental research” as defined at 22 CFR 120.11(8) and no prior review of data, including the final report, produced during the performance of the contract is required for export control or national security purposes before the contractor may publish, release, or otherwise disseminate the data.

      (2) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence by the program or project manager and where necessary the center Export Control Administrator, shall insert the clause with its Alternate II, when prior review of all data produced during the performance of the contract is required before the contractor may publish, release, or otherwise disseminate the data. For example, when data produced during performance of the contract may be subject to export control, national security restrictions, or other restrictions designated by NASA; or, to the extent the contractor receives or is given access to data that includes restrictive markings, may include proprietary information of others.

      (3) Except when Alternate II applies in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its Alternate III in all SBIR and STTR contracts.

      (e) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 1852.235-74, Additional Reports of Work—Research and Development, in all research and development contracts, and in interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving research and development work, when periodic reports, such as monthly or quarterly reports, or reports on the completion of significant units or phases of work are required for monitoring contract performance. The clause should be modified to reflect the reporting requirements of the contract and to indicate the timeframe for submission of the final report.

#### § 1837.170

        (a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in service contracts. However, pension portability requirements may be included in solicitations, contracts, or contract modifications for additional work under the following conditions:

        (1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options), and, if the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected to remain with the program; or

        (ii) The employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract or a contract consolidating existing services is awarded, and the total contract period covered by the plan covers a minimum of five years (including both the predecessor and successor contracts); and

        (2) The procurement officer determines in writing, with full supporting rationale, that such a requirement is in the Government's best interest. The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all such determinations.

        (b) When pension portability is required, the plan shall comply with the requirements of the clause at 1852.237-71, Pension Portability, (see 1837.110-70(b)), and the contract shall also include a clear description of the plan, including service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination, and benefits from prior contracts.

        1837.203-70   Providing contractors access to sensitive information.

#### § 1837.203-70

        (a)(1) As used in this subpart, “sensitive information” refers to information that the contractor has developed at private expense or that the Government has generated that qualifies for an exception to the Freedom of Information Act, which is not currently in the public domain, may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and may be sensitive or privileged, the disclosure of which is likely to have either of the following effects: To impair the Government's ability to obtain this type of information in the future; or to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained. The term is not intended to resemble the markings of national security documents as in sensitive-secret-top secret.

        (2) As used in this subpart, “requiring organization” refers to the NASA organizational element or activity that requires specified services to be provided.

        (3) As used in this subpart, “service provider” refers to the service contractor that receives sensitive information from NASA to provide services to the requiring organization.

        (b)(1) To support management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies on numerous service providers. These contractors may require access to sensitive information in the Government's possession, which may be entitled to protection from unauthorized use or disclosure.

        (2) As an initial step, the requiring organization shall identify when needed services may entail access to sensitive information and shall determine whether providing access is necessary for accomplishing the Agency's mission. The requiring organization shall review any service provider requests for access to information to determine whether the access is necessary and whether the information requested is considered “sensitive” as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (c) When the requiring organization determines that providing specified services will entail access to sensitive information, the solicitation shall require each potential service provider to submit with its proposal a preliminary analysis of possible organizational conflicts of interest that might flow from the award of a contract. After selection, or whenever it becomes clear that performance will necessitate access to sensitive information, the service provider must submit a comprehensive organizational conflicts of interest avoidance plan.

        (d) This comprehensive plan shall incorporate any previous studies performed, shall thoroughly analyze all organizational conflicts of interest that might arise because the service provider has access to other companies' sensitive information, and shall establish specific methods to control, mitigate, or eliminate all problems identified. The contracting officer, with advice from Center counsel, shall review the plan for completeness and identify to the service provider substantive weaknesses and omissions for necessary correction. Once the service provider has corrected the substantive weaknesses and omissions, the contracting officer shall incorporate the revised plan into the contract, as a compliance document.

        (e) If the service provider will be operating an information technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the operating contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, which requires the implementation of an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use.

        (f) NASA will monitor performance to assure any service provider that requires access to sensitive information follows the steps outlined in the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information, to protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

        1837.203-71   Release of contractors' sensitive information.

#### § 1837.203-71

        Pursuant to the clause at 1852.237-73, Release of Sensitive Information, offerors and contractors agree that NASA may release their sensitive information when requested by service providers in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 1837.203-70 and subject to the safeguards and protections delineated in the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. As required by the clause at 1852.237-73, or other contract clause or solicitation provision, contractors must identify information they claim to be “sensitive” submitted as part of a proposal or in the course of performing a contract. The contracting officer shall evaluate all contractor claims of sensitivity in deciding how NASA should respond to requests from service providers for access to information.

        1837.203-72   NASA contract clauses.

#### § 1837.203-72

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information, in all solicitations and contracts for services that may require access to sensitive information belonging to other companies or generated by the Government.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.237-73, Release of Sensitive Information, in all solicitations, contracts, and basic ordering agreements.

      Subpart 1845.71—Forms Preparation

        1845.7101   Instructions for preparing NASA Form 1018.

#### § 1845.7101

        NASA must account for and report assets in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3512 and 31 U.S.C. 3515, Federal Accounting Standards, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructions. Since contractors maintain NASA's official records for its assets in their possession, NASA must obtain periodic data from those records to meet these requirements. Changes in Federal Accounting Standards and OMB reporting requirements may occur from year to year, requiring contractor submission of supplemental information with the NASA Form (NF) 1018. The specific Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) to be used for property records are SFFAS No. 3 “Accounting for Inventory and Related Property”, SFFAS No. 6 “Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment”, SFFAS No. 10 “Accounting for Internal Use Software”, and SFFAS No. 11 “Amendments to PP&E: Definitions” issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. Classifications of property, related costs to be reported, and other reporting requirements are discussed in this subpart. NF 1018 (see 1853.3) provides critical information for NASA financial statements and property management. Accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the report are critical to many aspects of NASA's operations.

> [68 FR 62024, Oct. 31, 2003]

        1845.7101-1   Property classification.

#### § 1845.7101-1

        (a)  (1) Contractors shall report costs in the classifications on NF 1018, as described in this section. The cost of heritage assets and obsolete property will be reported on the NF 1018 under the appropriate classification. Supplemental reporting may also be required.

        (2)(i) Heritage assets are property, plant and equipment that possess one or more of the following characteristics:

        (A) Historical or natural significance;

        (B) Cultural, educational or artistic importance; or

        (C) Significant architectural characteristics.

        (ii) Examples of NASA heritage assets include buildings and structures designated as National Historic Landmarks as well as aircraft, spacecraft and related components on display to enhance public understanding of NASA programs. Heritage assets which serve both a heritage and government operation function are considered multi-use when the predominant use is in general government operations. Multi-use heritage assets will not be considered heritage assets for NF 1018 supplemental reporting purposes.

        (3) Obsolete property is property for which there are no current plans for use in its intended purpose (i.e., it no longer provides service to NASA operations). Examples of obsolete property are items in configurations which are no longer required or used by NASA or items held for engineering evaluation purposes only. NASA may have approved the retention of these items for programmatic reasons even though they have no current plans for use.

        (b)  Includes costs of land and improvements to land. Contractors shall report land with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more.

        (c)  Includes costs of buildings, improvements to buildings, and fixed equipment required for the operation of a building which is permanently attached to and a part of the building and cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, of floors. Contractors shall report buildings with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more. Examples of fixed equipment required for functioning of a building include plumbing, heating and lighting equipment, elevators, central air conditioning systems, and built-in safes and vaults.

        (d)  Includes costs of acquisitions and improvements of real property (i.e. structures and facilities other than buildings); for example, airfield pavements, harbor and port facilities, power production facilities and distribution systems, reclamation and irrigation facilities, flood control and navigation aids, utility systems (heating, sewage, water and electrical) when they serve several buildings or structures, communication systems, traffic aids, roads and bridges, railroads, monuments and memorials, and nonstructural improvements such as sidewalks, parking areas, and fences. Contractors shall report other structures and facilities with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more.

        (e)  Includes NASA-funded costs of improvements to leased buildings, structures, and facilities, as well as easements and right-of-way, where NASA is the lessee or the cost is charged to a NASA contract. Contractors shall report leasehold improvements with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more.

        (f)  Includes costs of work in process for the construction of Buildings, Other Structures and Facilities, and Leasehold Improvements to which NASA has title, regardless of value.

        (g)  Includes costs of commercially available personal property capable of stand-alone use in manufacturing supplies, performing services, or any general or administrative purpose (for example, machine tools, furniture, vehicles, computers, software, test equipment, including their accessory or auxiliary items). Software integrated into and necessary to operate another item of Government property is considered to be an auxiliary item (see FAR 45.501) and should be considered part of the item of which it is an integral part. Other software to which NASA has title shall be classified as an individual item of equipment for reporting purposes if it has a useful life of 2 years or more and acquisition cost of $1,000,000 or more (also see 1845.7101-3(g)). Enhancement costs for existing software should be added to the software acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally developed (i.e., a capability that was not included in the original software specifications, the total cost of the enhancement is $1,000,000 or more, or the expected useful life of the enhanced software is 2 years or more). Software licenses are excluded. Contractors shall separately report:

        (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and

        (2) All other items.

        (h)  Includes costs of equipment and manufacturing aids (and their components and replacements) of such a specialized nature that, without substantial modification or alteration, their use is limited to development or production of particular supplies or parts, or performance of particular services (see FAR 45.101). Examples include jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps and gauges. Contractors shall separately report:

        (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and

        (2) All other items.

        (i)  Includes costs of equipment used to accomplish special purpose testing in performing a contract, and items or assemblies of equipment (see FAR 45.101). Contractors shall separately report:

        (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and

        (2) All other items.

        (j)  Includes costs of NASA-owned property held in inventory regardless of whether or not it is unique to NASA programs, that may become a part of an end item or be expended in performing a contract. Examples include raw and processed material, spares, parts, assemblies, small tools and supplies. Material that is part of work-in-process is not included. Contractors shall report the amount for all Materials in inventory, regardless of unit acquisition cost.

        (k)  Includes costs of completed items, unique to NASA aeronautical and space programs, which are capable of stand-alone operation. Examples include research aircraft, reusable space vehicles, ground support equipment, prototypes, and mock-ups. The amount of property, title to which vests in NASA as a result of progress payments to fixed price subcontractors, shall be included to reflect the pro rata cost of undelivered agency-peculiar property. Completed end items not related to the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle program which otherwise meet the definition of Agency-Peculiar Property, and are destined for permanent operation in space, such as satellites and space probes, shall not be reported. Contractors shall separately report:

        (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and

        (2) All other items.

        (l)  Work-in-process (WIP) consists of property items under construction (i.e., not complete). It includes costs of all work-in-process regardless of value, and excludes costs of completed items reported in other categories. While the costs of WIP for International Space Station and Space Shuttle components should be included as WIP, satellites and space probes and their components should be excluded from WIP as those items will be accounted for by NASA.

        1845.7101-2   Transfers of property.

#### § 1845.7101-2

        A transfer is a change in accountability between and among prime contracts, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies (e.g., between contracts of the same NASA Center, contracts of different NASA Centers, a contract of one NASA Center to another, a NASA Center to a contract of another NASA Center, and a contract to another Government agency or its contract). To enable NASA to properly control and account for all transfers, they shall be adequately documented. Adequate documentation includes the appropriate dollar amount of the asset(s) transferred (as prescribed in 1845.7101-3) and the formal, signed NASA or contractor authorization approving the transfer. In addition, procurement, property, and financial organizations at NASA Centers must effect all transfers of accountability, although physical shipment and receipt of property may be made directly by contractors. The procedures described in this section shall be followed to provide an administrative and audit trail, even if property is physically shipped directly from one contractor to another. Property shipped between September 1 and September 30, inclusively, shall be accounted for and reported by the shipping contractor, regardless of the method of shipment, unless written evidence of receipt at destination has been received. Repairables provided under fixed price repair contracts that include the clause at 1852.245-72, Liability for Government Property Furnished for Repair or Other Services, remain accountable to the cognizant NASA Center and are not reportable on NF 1018; repairables provided under a cost-reimbursement contract, however, are accountable to the contractor and reportable on NF 1018. All materials provided to conduct repairs are reportable, regardless of contract type.

        (a)  The contractor must obtain approval of the contracting officer or designee for transfers of property off the prime contract before shipment. Each shipping document must be signed by the contracting officer or designee demonstrating such approval. Each shipping document must contain contract numbers, shipping references, property classifications in which the items are recorded (including Federal Supply Classification group (FSC) codes for equipment), unit acquisition costs (as defined in 1845.7101-3, Unit Acquisition Cost), original Government acquisition dates for items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more, and any other appropriate identifying or descriptive data. Where the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is used, the FSC code will be part of the national stock number (NSN) entered in Block 16 or, if the NSN is not provided, the FSC alone shall be shown in Block 16. The original Government acquisition date shall be shown in Block 23, by item. Other formats, such as the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, should be clearly annotated with the required information. Unit acquisition costs shall be obtained from records maintained pursuant to FAR part 45 and this part 1845, or, for uncompleted items where property records have not yet been established, from such other record systems as are appropriate such as manufacturing or engineering records used for work control and billing purposes. Shipping contractors shall furnish a copy of the formally approved shipping document to the cognizant property administrator. Shipping and receiving contractors shall promptly submit copies of shipping and receiving documents to the Center Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Finance, responsible for their respective contracts when accountability for NASA property is transferred to, or received from, other contracts, contractors, NASA Centers, or Government agencies.

        (b)  If property is transferred to another contract or contractor, the receiving contractor shall record the property in the same property classification and amount appearing on the shipping document. For example, when a contractor receives an item from another contractor that is identified on the shipping document as equipment, but that the recipient intends to incorporate into special test equipment, the recipient shall first record the item in the equipment account and subsequently reclassify it as special test equipment. Reclassification of equipment, special tooling, special test equipment, or agency-peculiar property requires prior approval of the contracting officer or a designee.

        (c)  If contractors receive transfer documents having insufficient detail to properly record the transfer ( omission of property classification, FSC, unit acquisition cost, Government acquisition date, required signatures, ) they shall request the omitted data directly from the shipping contractor or through the property administrator. The contracting officer shall assist the Government Property Administrator and the receiving contractor to obtain all required information for the receiving contractor to establish adequate property records.

        1845.7101-3   Unit acquisition cost.

#### § 1845.7101-3

        (a) The unit acquisition cost shall include all costs incurred to bring the property to a form and location suitable for its intended use. The following is representative of the types of costs that shall be included, when applicable:

        (1) Amounts paid to vendors or other contractors.

        (2) Transportation charges to the point of initial use.

        (3) Handling and storage charges.

        (4) Labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for assets produced or constructed).

        (5) Engineering, architectural, and other outside services for designs, plans, specifications, and surveys.

        (6) Acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other facilities.

        (7) An appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and facilities used in construction work.

        (8) Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for activities in a building or facility.

        (9) Direct costs of inspection, supervision, and administration of construction contracts and construction work.

        (10) Legal and recording fees and damage claims.

        (11) Fair values of facilities and equipment donated to the Government.

        (b) Acquisition cost shall include, where appropriate, for contractor acquired property, related fees, or a  portion of fees, paid by NASA to the contractor. Situations where inclusion of fees in the acquisition cost would be appropriate are those in which the contractor designs, develops, fabricates or purchases property for NASA and part of the fees paid to the contractor by NASA are related to that effort.

        (c) Acquisition cost shall be developed using actual costs to the greatest extent possible, especially costs directly related to fabrication such as labor and materials. Where estimates are used, there must be a documented methodology based on a historical basis. All acquisition costs shall be properly documented, supported and retained. Supporting documentation shall be made available upon request.

        (d) The use of weighted average methodologies is acceptable for valuation of Material.

        (e) Contractors shall report unit acquisition costs using records that are part of the prescribed property or financial control system as provided in this section. Fabrication costs shall be based on approved systems or procedures and include all direct and indirect costs of fabrication.

        (f) Only modifications that improve an item's capacity or extend its useful life two years or more and that cost $500,000 or more shall be reported on the NF 1018 on the $500,000 & Over line. The costs of any other modifications, excluding routine maintenance, will be reported on the Under $500,000 line. If an item's original unit acquisition cost is less than $500,000, but a single subsequent modification costs $500,000 or more, that modification only will be reported as an item $500,000 or more on subsequent NF 1018s. The original acquisition cost of the item will continue to be included in the under $500,000 total. The quantity for the modified item will remain “1” and be reported with the original acquisition cost of the item. If an item's acquisition cost is reduced by removal of components so that its remaining acquisition cost is under $500,000, it shall be reported as under $500,000.

        (g) Software acquisition costs include software costs incurred up through acceptance testing and material internal costs incurred to implement the software and otherwise make the software ready for use. Costs incurred after acceptance testing are excluded. License, maintenance, training, and data conversion costs are also excluded. If the software is purchased as part of a package, the costs will need to be segregated in such manner as to ensure that the excluded costs (maintenance, training, etc.) are not reported as part of the software's acquisition cost. Enhancement costs for existing software should be added to the acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally developed (i.e. a capability that was not included in the original software specifications), the total cost of the enhancement is $1,000,000 or more, and the expected useful life of the enhanced software is 2 years or more. Include the same types of cost as indicated above under new software. Costs incurred solely to repair a design flaw or perform minor upgrades should not be included.

        (h) The computation of work in process (WIP) shall include all direct and indirect costs of fabrication, including associated systems, subsystems, and spare parts and components furnished or acquired and charged to work in process pending incorporation into a finished item. These types of items make up what is sometimes called production inventory and include programmed extra units to cover replacement during the fabrication process (production spares). Also included are deliverable items on which the contractor or a subcontractor has begun work, and materials issued from inventory. The computation of WIP shall incorporate the other requirements for unit acquisition cost as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. In addition, acquisition cost of property furnished by the Government, which has been incorporated in the property item under construction or in process of fabrication, should be included. Do not include costs for operation or repairing existing completed property items. Once the property is complete, include all the costs outlined above in its acquisition value in the property record. The WIP values are inception to date until such time as the WIP is completed. It does not include future costs.

Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, the definition of “aircraft” should be modified to specify that the aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged aircraft. The definition of “in the open” may be modified to include “hush houses,” test hangars, comparable structures, and other designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified to provide for Government assumption of risk of transportation by conveyance on streets or highways if the contracting officer determines that this transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor's premises and is merely incident to work being performed under the contract.
