#### § § 6701.102

This prohibition applies, but is not limited to, solicitation for the sale of insurance, stock, mutual funds, real estate, computer equipment and any other commodities, goods or services except:

    (a) The one-time sale of the employee's personal property or privately owned dwelling; or

    (b) Sales made in the course of outside employment of GSA employees in retail stores and under other circumstances not involving solicitation.

    § 6701.103   Prohibited purchases of property sold by GSA.

#### § § 6701.103

    (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no GSA employee, or spouse or minor child of a GSA employee, shall purchase, directly or indirectly Government property, real or personal, being sold by GSA.

    (b)  The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the purchase of foreign gifts deposited with the agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7342, that an employee may purchase pursuant to 41 CFR part 101-49.

    (c)  An employee may make a purchase otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section where a written waiver of the prohibition has been given to the employee by the Administrator of GSA or his designee. Such a waiver may be granted only upon a determination that the waiver is not otherwise prohibited by law and that, in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular circumstances, the purchase of the property will not raise a question as to whether the employee has used his official position or nonpublic information to obtain an advantageous purchase or create an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of the employee's duties.

    § 6701.104   Prohibited purchases of real estate by certain GSA employees involved in the acquisition or disposal of real estate.

#### § § 6701.104

    (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, employees who personally and substantially participate in or have official responsibility for the acquisition or disposal of real estate or interests therein, shall not directly or indirectly purchase or participate as an agent or otherwise in the purchase of any real estate or interest therein.

    (b)  The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to an employee's purchase of real estate for use as his personal or other residential property, such as a vacation home.

    (c)  An employee may make a purchase otherwise prohibited by this section where a written waiver of the prohibition has been given to the employee by the employee's immediate supervisor, with the advice of a Deputy Standards of Conduct Counsellor or the Designated Agency Ethics Official. Such a waiver may be granted only if a determination is made that the waiver is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation, and that in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular circumstances, the purchase of such real estate or interest therein will not raise a question as to whether the employee will use his official position or nonpublic information to obtain an advantageous purchase or create an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of the employee's duties.

    § 6701.105   Taking or disposing of Government property.

#### § § 6701.105

    An employee shall not, directly or indirectly, take or dispose of, or allow the taking or disposal of, Government property, unless authorized to do so. For purposes of this section, property remains Government property until disposed of in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.

    (1) The employee's name, location and occupational title;

    (2) A brief description of the employee's official duties;

    (3) The nature of the outside employment, including a full description of the specific duties or services to be performed;

It includes but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless the participation involves the provision of professional services or advice for compensation other than reimbursement for actual expenses.

    (2)  has the meaning in 5 CFR 2635.203(d), and includes any person who:

    (i) Is seeking official action by GSA;
