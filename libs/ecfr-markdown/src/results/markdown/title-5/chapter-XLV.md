    § 5501.101   General.

#### § § 5501.101

    (a)  The regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. In addition to 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by HHS components in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). Employees are also subject to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, the Employee Responsibilities and Conduct regulations at 5 CFR part 735, and the HHS regulations regarding conduct at 45 CFR part 73.

    (b)  The regulations in this part apply to individuals who are “employees” within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.102(h). The regulations thus apply to special Government employees, except to the extent they are specifically excluded from certain provisions, and to uniformed service officers in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps on active duty.

    (c)  Unless a term is otherwise defined in this part, the definitions set forth in 5 CFR parts 2635 and 2640 apply to terms in this part. In addition, for purposes of this part:

    (1)  means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. 1601  which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

    (2)  means an organization for which the sales of products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) constitute ten percent or more of annual gross sales in the organization's previous fiscal year; where an organization does not have a record of sales of FDA-regulated products, it will be deemed to be significantly regulated if its operations are predominately in fields regulated by FDA, or if its research, development, or other business activities are reasonably expected to result in the development of products that are regulated by FDA.

    § 5501.102   Designation of HHS components as separate agencies.

#### § § 5501.102

    (a)  Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the twelve components of HHS listed below is designated as an agency separate from each of the other eleven listed components and, for employees of that component, as an agency distinct from the remainder of HHS. However, the components listed below are not deemed to be separate agencies for purposes of applying any provision of 5 CFR part 2635 or this part to employees of the remainder of HHS:

    (12) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

    (b) —(1)  includes, in addition to employees actually within a component, an employee of the Office of the General Counsel whose regularly assigned duties and responsibilities principally involve the provision of legal services to the relevant component with respect to substantive programmatic issues.

    (2)  means employees in the Office of the Secretary and Staff Divisions, employees of the Office of the General Counsel with Department-wide responsibility, and any HHS employee not in one of the 12 components designated as separate agencies in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c)  The designations in paragraph (a) of this section identify an employee's “agency” for purposes of:

    (1) Determining when a person is a prohibited source within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.203(d) for purposes of applying:

    (i) The regulations at subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources; and

    (ii) The regulations at § 5501.106 requiring prior approval of outside employment and other outside activities; and

    (iii) The regulations at § 5501.111 governing the receipt of awards by employees of the National Institutes of Health; and

    § 5501.103   Gifts from federally recognized Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations.

#### § § 5501.103

    (a)  In addition to the gifts which come within the exceptions set forth in 5 CFR 2635.204, and subject to all provisions of 5 CFR 2635.201 through 2635.205, an employee may accept unsolicited gifts of native artwork, crafts, or other items representative of traditional native culture from federally recognized Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations, provided that the aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one tribe or village under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed $200 in a calendar year.

    (b)  If the donor is a tribe or village that has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of an employee's official duties, the employee may accept the gifts authorized by paragraph (a) of this section only where there is a written finding by the agency designee that acceptance of the gift is in the agency's interest and will not violate any of the limitations on the use of exceptions contained in 5 CFR 2635.202(c).

> [61 FR 39763, July 30, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 5558, Feb. 3, 2005]

    § 5501.104   Prohibited financial interests applicable to employees of the Food and Drug Administration.

#### § § 5501.104

    (a)  Except as permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, no employee or spouse or minor child of an employee, other than a special Government employee or the spouse or minor child of a special Government employee, of the Food and Drug Administration shall have a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization.

    (b)  Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section:

    (1) An employee or spouse or minor child of an employee may have a financial interest, such as a pension or other employee benefit, arising from employment with a significantly regulated organization.

    (2) An employee who is not required to file a public or confidential financial disclosure report pursuant to 5 CFR part 2634, or the spouse or minor child of such employee, may hold a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization if:

    (i) The total cost or value, measured at the time of acquisition, of the combined interests of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children in the regulated organization is equal to or less than the  exemption limit for matters involving parties established by 5 CFR 2640.202(a) or $15,000, whichever is greater (the phrase “time of acquisition” shall mean the date on which the employee actually acquired the financial interest—or on which the financial interest became imputed to the employee under 18 U.S.C. 208—whether by purchase, gift, bequest, marriage, or otherwise, except that with respect to a financial interest that was acquired prior to the employee's entrance on duty as an employee of the Food and Drug Administration, the “time of acquisition” shall be deemed to be the date on which the employee entered on duty);

    (ii) The holding, if it represents an equity interest, constitutes less than 1 percent of the total outstanding equity of the organization; and

    (iii) The total holdings in significantly regulated organizations account for less than 50 percent of the total value of the combined investment portfolios of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children.

    (3) An employee or spouse or minor child of an employee may have an interest in a significantly regulated organization that constitutes any interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund (e.g., a mutual fund), or a widely held pension or similar fund, which, in the literature it distributes to prospective and current investors or participants, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in significantly regulated organizations, if the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.

    (4) In cases involving exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee may grant a written exception to permit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to hold a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization based upon a determination that the application of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality or objectivity with which HHS programs are administered or to avoid a violation of part 2635 of this title.

    (c)  For purposes of determining the divestiture period specified in 5 CFR 2635.403(d), as applied to financial interests prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section, the “date divestiture is first directed” means the date on which the new entrant public or confidential financial disclosure report required by part 2634 of this title or any report required by § 5502.106(c) of this chapter is due.

> [61 FR 39763, July 30, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 5558, Feb. 3, 2005]

#### § § 5501.105

    (a) Under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(4), an employee who otherwise would be disqualified may participate in a particular matter where the otherwise disqualifying financial interest that would be affected results solely from the interest of the employee, or the employee's spouse or minor child, in birthrights:

    (1) In an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians;

    (2) In an Indian allotment the title to which is held in trust by the United States or which is inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States; or

    (3) In an Indian claims fund held in trust or administered by the United States.

    (b) The exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section applies only if the particular matter does not involve the Indian allotment or claims fund or the Indian tribe, band, nation, organized group or community, or Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or parties.

    § 5501.106   Outside employment and other outside activities.

#### § § 5501.106

    (B) The exception to 18 U.S.C. 205 described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply unless the employee has obtained the approval of a supervisory official who has authority to determine whether the employee's proposed representation of another person in a personnel administration matter is consistent with the faithful performance of the employee's duties.

    (d) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an employee shall obtain written approval prior to engaging, with or without compensation, in outside employment, including self-employed business activities, or other outside activities in which the employee seeks to:

    (O) Such other relevant information that the designated agency ethics official or, with the concurrence of the designated agency ethics official, each of the separate agency components of HHS listed in § 5501.102(a) determines is necessary or appropriate in order to evaluate whether a proposed activity is likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.

    (5)  Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or other outside activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.

With respect to teaching, speaking, writing, or editing activities, the instructions or manual issuances may specify preclearance procedures and/or require disclaimers indicating that the views expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the agency or the United States.

    (iii) The officials within the respective HHS components who are responsible for the administrative aspects of these regulations and the maintenance of records shall make provisions for the filing and retention of requests for approval of outside employment and other outside activities and copies of the notification of approval or disapproval.

    (e)  The designated agency ethics official may grant a written waiver, for an individual or class of similarly situated individuals, from any prohibited outside activity provision in this section or in § 5501.109 based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered. An individual or class waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.

    (b)  A special Government employee may accept compensation for teaching, speaking or writing in circumstances described in paragraph (a) of this section only where the special Government employee recuses from the official assignment that may substantially affect the interests of the person who extended the invitation to engage in the activity or the offer of compensation.
