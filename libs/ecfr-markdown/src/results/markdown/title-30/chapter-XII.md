        § 1202.52   Royalties.

#### § § 1202.52

        (a) Royalties on oil, gas, and OCS sulfur shall be at the royalty rate specified in the lease, unless the Secretary, pursuant to the provisions of the applicable mineral leasing laws, reduces, or in the case of OCS leases, reduces or eliminates, the royalty rate or net profit share set forth in the lease.

        (b) For purposes of this subpart, the use of the term  includes the term

        § 1202.53   Minimum royalty.

#### § § 1202.53

        For leases that provide for minimum royalty payments, the lessee shall pay the minimum royalty as specified in the lease.

      Subpart C—Federal and Indian Oil

        § 1202.100   Royalty on oil.

#### § § 1202.100

        (a) Royalties due on oil production from leases subject to the requirements of this part, including condensate separated from gas without processing, shall be at the royalty rate established by the terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) requires payment in-kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to part 1206 of this title multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.

        (b)(1) All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this part applies is subject to royalty.

        (2) When oil is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with the approval of the BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty-free.

        (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this section, the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        (c) If BLM determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an onshore lease, or that oil was drained from an onshore lease for which compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an offshore lease, then the value of that oil shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.

        (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost oil, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.

        (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the value, for royalty purposes, of production attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value, for royalty purposes, of that portion as though the person actually selling or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian lease.

        (2) If a Federal or Indian lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee ONRR may authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purposes of these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which royalties are due.

        (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.

        (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior periods when the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.

        (f) For production from Federal and Indian leases which are committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon request of a lessee ONRR may establish the value of production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms, and agreement terms; (2) persons with an interest in the agreement, including, to the extent practical, royalty interests, are given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in a Federal or Indian lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

        § 1202.101   Standards for reporting and paying royalties.

#### § § 1202.101

        Oil volumes are to be reported in barrels of clean oil of 42 standard U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches each) at 60 °F. When reporting oil volumes for royalty purposes, corrections must have been made for Basic Sediment and Water (BS&W) and other impurities. Reported American Petroleum Institute (API) oil gravities are to be those determined in accordance with standard industry procedures after correction to 60 °F.

        § 1202.150   Royalty on gas.

#### § § 1202.150

        (a) Royalties due on gas production from leases subject to the requirements of this subpart, except helium produced from Federal leases, shall be at the rate established by the terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless ONRR requires payment in kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 1206 of this title multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.

        (b)(1) All gas (except gas unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that gas used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the BSEE or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal lease to which this subpart applies is subject to royalty.

        (2) When gas is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with the approval of BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty free.

        (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this subpart, the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        (c) If BLM determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an onshore lease, or that gas was drained from an onshore lease for which compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an OCS lease, then the value of that gas shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.

        (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.

        (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a Federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the production attributable to its Federal lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the value for royalty purposes of production attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value for royalty purposes of that portion, as if the person actually selling or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal lease.

        (2) If a Federal lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee ONRR may authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purpose of these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which royalties are due.

        (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.

        (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior periods at the time the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.

        (f) For production from Federal leases which are committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon request of a lessee ONRR may establish the value of production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms and agreement terms; (2) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in the agreement, including royalty interests, are given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in a Federal lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

        § 1202.151   Royalty on processed gas.

#### § § 1202.151

        (a)(1) A royalty, as provided in the lease, shall be paid on the value of:

        (i) Any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing; and

        (ii) Residue gas and all gas plant products resulting from processing the gas produced from a lease subject to this subpart.

        (2) ONRR shall authorize a processing allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing the gas produced from Federal leases. Processing allowances shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206 subpart D for gas production from Federal leases and 30 CFR part 1206 subpart E for gas production from Indian leases.

        (b) A reasonable amount of residue gas shall be allowed royalty free for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance shall be made for boosting residue gas or other expenses incidental to marketing, except as provided in 30 CFR part 1206. In those situations where a processing plant processes gas from more than one lease, only that proportionate share of each lease's residue gas necessary for the operation of the processing plant shall be allowed royalty free.

        (c) No royalty is due on residue gas, or any gas plant product resulting from processing gas, which is reinjected into a reservoir within the same lease, unit area, or communitized area, when the reinjection is included in a plan of development or operations and the plan has received BLM or Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approval for onshore or offshore operations, respectively, until such time as they are finally produced from the reservoir for sale or other disposition off-lease.

        § 1202.152   Standards for reporting and paying royalties on gas.

#### § § 1202.152

        (a)(1) If you are responsible for reporting production or royalties, you must:

        (i) Report gas volumes and British thermal unit (Btu) heating values, if applicable, under the same degree of water saturation;

        (ii) Report gas volumes in units of 1,000 cubic feet (mcf); and

        (iii) Report gas volumes and Btu heating value at a standard pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and a standard temperature base of 60 °F.

        (2) The frequency and method of Btu measurement as set forth in the lessee's contract shall be used to determine Btu heating values for reporting purposes. However, the lessee shall measure the Btu value at least semiannually by recognized standard industry testing methods even if the lessee's contract provides for less frequent measurement.

        (b)(1) Residue gas and gas plant product volumes shall be reported as specified in this paragraph.

        (**2**) Carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen (N), helium (He), residue gas, and any other gas marketed as a separate product shall be reported by using the same standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (3) Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes shall be reported in standard U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches) at 60 °F.

        (4) Sulfur (S) volumes shall be reported in long tons (2,240 pounds).

        § 1202.351   Royalties on geothermal resources.

#### § § 1202.351

        (a)(1) Royalties on geothermal resources, including byproducts, or on electricity produced using geothermal resources, will be at the royalty rate(s) specified in the lease, unless the Secretary of the Interior temporarily waives, suspends, or reduces that rate(s). Royalties are determined under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.

        (2) Fees in lieu of royalties on geothermal resources are prescribed in 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.

        (3) Except for the amount credited against royalties for in-kind deliveries of electricity to a State or county under § 1218.306, you must pay royalties and direct use fees in money.

        (b)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, royalties or fees are due on—

        (i) All geothermal resources produced from a lease and that are sold or used by the lessee or are reasonably susceptible to sale or use by the lessee, or

        (ii) All proceeds derived from the sale of electricity produced using geothermal resources produced from a lease.

        (2) For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “Class I lease,” “Class II lease,” and “Class III lease” have the same meanings prescribed in § 1206.351.

        (i) For Class I leases, ONRR will allow free of royalty—

        (A) Geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), or that are reasonably necessary to generate plant parasitic electricity or electricity for Federal lease operations; and

        (B) A reasonable amount of commercially demineralized water necessary for power plant operations or otherwise used on or for the benefit of the lease.

        (ii) For Class II and Class III leases where the lessee uses geothermal resources for commercial production or generation of electricity, or where geothermal resources are sold at arm's length for the commercial production or generation of electricity, ONRR will allow free of royalty or direct use fees geothermal resources that are:

        (A) Unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM;

        (B) Reasonably necessary for the lessee to generate plant parasitic electricity or electricity for Federal lease operations, as approved by BLM; or

        (C) Otherwise used for Federal lease operations related to commercial production or generation of electricity, as approved by BLM.

        (iii) For Class II and Class III leases where the lessee uses the geothermal resources for a direct use or in a direct use facility, as defined in § 1206.351, resources that are used to generate electricity for Federal lease operations or that are otherwise used for Federal lease operations are subject to direct use fees, except for geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM.

        (3) Royalties on byproducts are due at the time the recovered byproduct is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. Byproducts produced and added to stockpiles or inventory do not require payment of royalty until the byproducts are sold, utilized, or otherwise finally disposed of. The ONRR may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventories become excessive.

        (c) If BLM determines that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were avoidably lost or wasted from the lease, or that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were drained from the lease for which compensatory royalty (or compensatory fees in lieu of compensatory royalty) are due, the value of those geothermal resources, or the royalty or fees owed, will be determined under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.

        (d) If a lessee receives insurance or other compensation for unavoidably lost geothermal resources (including byproducts), royalties at the rates specified in the lease (or fees in lieu of royalties) are due on the amount of, or as a result of, that compensation. This paragraph will not apply to compensation through self-insurance.

#### § § 1202.353

        (a) For geothermal resources used to generate electricity, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 (Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance) as follows:

        (1) For geothermal resources for which royalty is calculated under § 1206.352(a), you must report quantities in:

        (i) Thousands of pounds to the nearest whole thousand pounds if the contract for the geothermal resources specifies delivery in terms of weight; or

        (ii) Millions of Btu to the nearest whole million Btu if the sales contract for the geothermal resources specifies delivery in terms of heat or thermal energy.

        (2) For geothermal resources for which royalty is calculated under § 1206.352(b), you must report the quantities in kilowatt-hours to the nearest whole kilowatt-hour.

        (b) For geothermal resources used in direct use processes, you must report the quantity on which a royalty or direct use fee is due on Form ONRR-2014 in:

        (1) Millions of Btu to the nearest whole million Btu if valuation is in terms of heat or thermal energy used or displaced;

        (2) Millions of gallons to the nearest million gallons of geothermal fluid produced if valuation or fee calculation is in terms of volume;

        (3) Millions of pounds to the nearest million pounds of geothermal fluid produced if valuation or fee calculation is in terms of mass; or

        (4) Any other measurement unit ONRR approves for valuation and reporting purposes.

        (c) For byproducts, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 consistent with ONRR-established reporting standards.

        (d) For commercially demineralized water, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 in hundreds of gallons to the nearest hundred gallons.

        (e) You need not report the quality of geothermal resources, including byproducts, to ONRR. However, you must maintain quality measurements for audit purposes. Quality measurements include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Temperatures and chemical analyses for fluid geothermal resources; and

        (2) Chemical analyses, weight percent, or other purity measurements for byproducts.

        § 1202.550   How do I determine the royalty due on gas production?

#### § § 1202.550

        If you produce gas from an Indian lease subject to this subpart, you must determine and pay royalties on gas production as specified in this section.

        (a)  You must calculate your royalty using the royalty rate in the lease.

        (b)  You must pay royalty in value unless:

        (1) The Tribal lessor requires payment in kind; or

        (2) You have a lease on allotted lands and ONRR requires payment in kind.

        (c)  You must use the following calculations to determine royalty due on the production from or attributable to your lease.

        (1) When paid in value, the royalty due is the unit value of production for royalty purposes, determined under 30 CFR part 1206, multiplied by the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.

        (2) When paid in kind, the royalty due is the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate.

        (d)  The Indian lessor and the Secretary may approve a request for a royalty rate reduction. In your request you must demonstrate economic hardship.

        (e)  You must report and pay royalties as provided in part 1218 of this title.

        § 1202.551   How do I determine the volume of production for which I must pay royalty if my lease is not in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?

#### § § 1202.551

        (a) You are liable for royalty on your entitled share of gas production from your Indian lease, except as provided in §§ 1202.555, 1202.556, and 1202.557.

        (b) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease must report and pay royalties based on your takes. If another person takes some of your entitled share but does not pay the royalties owed, you are liable for those royalties.

        (c) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease may ask ONRR for permission to report and pay royalties based on your entitlements. In that event, ONRR will provide valuation instructions consistent with this part and part 1206 of this title.

        § 1202.552   How do I determine how much royalty I must pay if my lease is in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?

#### § § 1202.552

        You must pay royalties each month on production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. To determine the volume and the value of your production, you must follow these three steps:

        (a) You must determine the volume of your entitled share of production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. This may include production from more than one AFA.

        (b) You must value the production you take using 30 CFR part 1206. If you take more than your entitled share of production, see § 1202.553 for information on how to value this production. If you take less than your entitled share of production, see § 1202.554 for information on how to value production you are entitled to but do not take.

        § 1202.553   How do I value my production if I take more than my entitled share?

#### § § 1202.553

        If you take more than your entitled share of production from a lease in an AFA for any month, you must determine the weighted-average value of all of the production that you take using the procedures in 30 CFR part 1206, and use that value for your entitled share of production.

        § 1202.554   How do I value my production that I do not take if I take less than my entitled share?

#### § § 1202.554

        If you take none or only part of your entitled production from a lease in an AFA for any month, use this section to value the production that you are entitled to but do not take.

        (a) If you take a significant volume of production from your lease during the month, you must determine the weighted average value of the production that you take using 30 CFR part 1206, and use that value for the production that you do not take.

        (b) If you do not take a significant volume of production from your lease during the month, you must use paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies.

        (c) In a month where you do not take production or take an insignificant volume, and if you would have used § 1206.172(b) to value the production if you had taken it, you must determine the value of production not taken for that month under § 1206.172(b) as if you had taken it.

        (d) If you take none of your entitled share of production from a lease in an AFA, and if that production cannot be valued under § 1206.172(b), then you must determine the value of the production that you do not take using the first of the following methods that applies:

        (1) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) in that month from other leases in the same AFA.

        (2) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) in that month from other leases in the same field or area.

        (3) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) during the previous month for production from leases in the same AFA.

        (4) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) during the previous month for production from other leases in the same field or area.

        (5) The latest major portion value that you received from ONRR calculated under § 1206.174 for the same ONRR-designated area.

        (e) You may take less than your entitled share of AFA production for any month, but pay royalties on the full volume of your entitled share under this section. If you do, you will owe no additional royalty for that lease for that month when you later take more than your entitled share to balance your account. The provisions of this paragraph (e) also apply when the other AFA participants pay you money to balance your account.

        § 1202.555   What portion of the gas that I produce is subject to royalty?

#### § § 1202.555

        (a) All gas produced from or allocated to your Indian lease is subject to royalty except the following:

        (1) Gas that is unavoidably lost.

        (2) Gas that is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease.

        (3) Gas that is used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approves such off-lease use.

        (4) Gas used as plant fuel as provided in § 1206.179(e).

        (b) You may use royalty-free only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility when you use gas for one of the following purposes:

        (1) On, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with BLM's approval.

        (2) At a production facility handling unitized or communitized production.

        (c) If the terms of your lease are inconsistent with this subpart, your lease terms will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        § 1202.556   How do I determine the value of avoidably lost, wasted, or drained gas?

#### § § 1202.556

        If BLM determines that a volume of gas was avoidably lost or wasted, or a volume of gas was drained from your Indian lease for which compensatory royalty is due, then you must determine the value of that volume of gas under 30 CFR part 1206.

        § 1202.557   Must I pay royalty on insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas?

#### § § 1202.557

        If you receive insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas, you must pay royalties on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph does not apply to compensation through self-insurance.

        § 1202.558   What standards do I use to report and pay royalties on gas?

#### § § 1202.558

        (a) You must report gas volumes as follows:

        (1) Report gas volumes and Btu heating values, if applicable, under the same degree of water saturation. Report gas volumes and Btu heating value at a standard pressure base of 14.73 psia and a standard temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Report gas volumes in units of 1,000 cubic feet (Mcf).

        (2) You must use the frequency and method of Btu measurement stated in your contract to determine Btu heating values for reporting purposes. However, you must measure the Btu value at least semi-annually by recognized standard industry testing methods even if your contract provides for less frequent measurement.

        (b) You must report residue gas and gas plant product volumes as follows:

        (1) Report carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen (N), helium (He), residue gas, and any gas marketed as a separate product by using the same standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) Report natural gas liquid (NGL) volumes in standard U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches) at 60 degrees F.

        (3) Report sulfur (S) volumes in long tons (2,240 pounds).

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1204.1   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 1204.1

        This part explains how you as a lessee or designee of a Federal onshore or Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas lease may obtain prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for production from certain marginal properties. This part does not apply to production from Indian leases, even if the Indian lease is within an agreement that qualifies as a marginal property.

        § 1204.2   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 1204.2

        means a federally approved communitization agreement or unit participating area.

        means the combined equivalent production of oil and gas stated in barrels of oil. Each barrel of oil production is equal to one BOE. Also, each 6,000 cubic feet of gas production is equal to one BOE.

        means the 12-month period from July 1 through June 30 immediately preceding the calendar year for which you take or request marginal property relief. For example, if you request relief for calendar year 2006, your base period is July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005.

        means the total of all oil and gas production for the marginal property, stated in BOE.

        means the person designated by a lessee under § 1218.52 to make all or part of the royalty or other payments due on a lease on the lessee's behalf.

        means only those producing oil or gas wells that contribute to the sum of BOE used in the calculation under § 1204.4(c). _Producing wells_ do not include injection or water wells. Wells with multiple zones commingled downhole are considered as a single well.

        means a lease, a portion of a lease, or an agreement that may be a marginal property if it meets the qualification requirements of § 1204.4.

        means the State that receives a statutorily prescribed portion of the royalties from a Federal onshore or OCS lease.

        § 1204.3   What alternatives are available for marginal properties?

#### § § 1204.3

        If you have production from a marginal property, ONRR and the State may allow you the following options:

        (a)  ONRR and the State may allow you to make a lump-sum advance payment of royalties instead of monthly royalty payments for the remainder of the lease term. See subpart B for prepayment of royalty requirements.

        (b)  ONRR and the State may allow various accounting and auditing relief options to encourage you to continue to produce and develop your marginal property. See subpart C for accounting and auditing relief requirements.

        § 1204.4   What is a marginal property under this part?

#### § § 1204.4

        (a) To qualify as a marginal property eligible for royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief under this part, the property must meet the following requirements:

        (b) To qualify as a marginal property for a calendar year, the combined equivalent production of the property during the base period must equal an average daily well production of less than 15 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per well per day calculated under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) To determine the average daily well production for a property, divide the sum of the BOE for all producing wells on the property during the base period by the sum of the number of days that each of those wells actually produced during the base period. If the property is an agreement, your calculation under this paragraph must include all wells included in the agreement, even if they are not on a Federal onshore or OCS lease.

        § 1204.5   What statutory requirements must I meet to obtain royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief?

#### § § 1204.5

        (a) ONRR and the State may allow royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for your marginal property production if ONRR and the State jointly determine that the prepayment or accounting and auditing relief is in the best interests of the Federal Government and the State to:

        (1) Promote production;

        (2) Reduce the administrative costs of ONRR and the State; and

        (3) Increase net receipts to the Federal Government and the State.

        (b) At any time, if ONRR and the State determine that either prepayment or accounting and auditing relief no longer meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, ONRR, with the State's concurrence, may discontinue any prepayment or accounting and auditing relief options granted for production from any marginal property.

        (1) ONRR will provide you written notice of the decision to discontinue relief.

        (i) If you took the cumulative reports and payments relief option under § 1204.202, your relief will terminate at the end of the calendar year in which you received the notice.

        (ii) If you were approved for prepayment relief under subpart B of this part or other relief under § 1204.203, ONRR's notice will tell you when your relief terminates.

        (2) ONRR's decision to discontinue relief is not subject to administrative appeal.

        § 1204.6   May I appeal if ONRR denies my request for prepayment or other relief?

#### § § 1204.6

        If ONRR denies your request for prepayment relief under subpart B of this part or other relief under § 1204.203, you may appeal under 30 CFR part 1290.

      Subpart B—Prepayment of Royalty [Reserved]

      Subpart C—Accounting and Auditing Relief

        § 1204.200   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1204.200

        This subpart explains how you as a lessee or designee may obtain accounting and auditing relief for your Federal onshore or OCS lease production from a marginal property. The two types of accounting and auditing relief that you can receive under this subpart are cumulative reports and payment relief (explained in § 1204.202) and other accounting and auditing relief appropriate for your property (explained in § 1204.203).

        § 1204.201   Who may obtain accounting and auditing relief?

#### § § 1204.201

        (a) You may obtain accounting and auditing relief under this subpart:

        (1) If you are a lessee or a designee for a Federal lease with production from a property that qualifies as a marginal property under § 1204.4;

        (2) If you meet any additional requirements for specific types of relief under this subpart; and

        (3) Only for the fractional interest in production from the marginal property for which you report and pay royalty. You may obtain relief even if the other lessees or designees for your lease or agreement do not request relief.

        (b) You may not obtain one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart on any portion of production from a marginal property if:

        (1) The marginal property covers multiple States; and

        (2) One of the States determines under § 1204.208 that it will not allow the relief option you seek.

        § 1204.202   What is the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option?

#### § § 1204.202

        (a) The cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option allows you to submit one royalty report and payment annually for production during a calendar year. You are eligible for this option only if the total volume produced from the marginal property (not just your share of the production) is 1,000 BOE or less during the base period.

        (b) To use the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option, you must do all of the following:

        (1) Notify ONRR in writing by January 31 of the calendar year for which you begin taking your relief. See § 1204.205(a) for what your notification must contain;

        (2) Submit your royalty report and payment in accordance with 30 CFR 1218.51(g) by the end of February of the year following the calendar year for which you reported annually, unless you have an estimated payment on file. If you have an estimated payment on file, you must submit your royalty report and payment by the end of March of the year following the calendar year for which you reported annually;

        (3) Use the sales month prior to the month that you submit your annual report and payment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section on your Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form ONRR-2014, for the entire previous calendar year's production for which you are paying annually. (For example, for a report in February use January as your sales month, and for a report in March use February as your sales month, to report production for the entire previous calendar year for which you are paying annually);

        (4) Report one line of cumulative royalty information on Form ONRR-2014 for the calendar year, the same as if it were a monthly report; and

        (5) Report allowances on Form ONRR-2014 on the same annual basis as the royalties for your marginal property production.

        (c) If you do not pay your royalty by the date due in paragraph (b) of this section, you will owe late payment interest determined under 30 CFR 1218.54 from the date your payment was due under this section until the date ONRR receives it.

        (d) If you take relief you are not qualified for, you may be liable for civil penalties. Also you must:

        (1) Pay ONRR late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your payment was due until the date ONRR receives it; and

        (2) Amend your Form ONRR-2014 to reflect the required monthly reporting.

        (e) If you dispose of your ownership interest in a marginal property for which you have taken relief under this section (or if you are a designee who reports and pays royalty for a lessee who has disposed of its ownership interest), you must:

        (1) Report and pay royalties for the portion of the calendar year for which you had an ownership interest; and

        (2) Make the report and payment by the end of the month after you dispose of the ownership interest in the marginal property. If you do not report and pay timely, you will owe interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date the payment was due under this section.

> [69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 30200, May 22, 2013]

        § 1204.203   What is the other relief option?

#### § § 1204.203

        (a) Under this relief option, you may request any type of accounting and auditing relief that is appropriate for production from your marginal property, provided it is not prohibited under § 1204.204 and meets the statutory requirements of § 1204.5. Examples of relief options you could request are:

        (1) To report and pay royalties using a valuation method other than that required under 30 CFR part 1206 that approximates royalties payable under that part 1206; and

        (2) To reduce your royalty audit burden. However, ONRR will not consider any request that eliminates ONRR's or the States' right to audit.

        (b) You must request approval from ONRR under § 1204.205(b), and receive approval under § 1204.206 before taking relief under this option.

        § 1204.204   What accounting and auditing relief will ONRR not allow?

#### § § 1204.204

        ONRR will not approve your request for accounting and auditing relief under this subpart if your request:

        (a) Prohibits ONRR or the State from conducting any form of audit;

        (b) Permanently relieves you from making future royalty reports or payments;

        (c) Provides for less frequent royalty reports and payments than annually;

        (d) Provides for you to submit royalty reports and payments at separate times;

        (e) Impairs ONRR's ability to properly or efficiently account for or distribute royalties;

        (f) Requests relief for a lease under which the Federal Government takes its royalties in kind;

        (g) Alters production reporting requirements;

        (h) Alters lease operation or safety requirements;

        (i) Conflicts with rent, minimum royalty, or lease requirements; or

        (j) Requests relief for production from a marginal property located in whole or in part in a State that has determined that it will not allow such relief under § 1204.208.

        § 1204.205   How do I obtain accounting and auditing relief?

#### § § 1204.205

        (a) To take cumulative reports and payments relief under § 1204.202, you must notify ONRR in writing by January 31 of the calendar year for which you begin taking your relief.

        (1) Your notification must contain:

        (i) Your company name, ONRR-assigned payor code, address, phone number, and contact name; and

        (ii) The specific ONRR lease number and agreement number, if applicable.

        (2) You may file a single notification for multiple marginal properties.

        (b) To obtain other relief under § 1204.203, you must file a written request for relief with ONRR.

        (1) Your request must contain:

        (i) Your company name, ONRR-assigned payor code, address, phone number, and contact name;

        (ii) The ONRR lease number and agreement number, if applicable; and

        (iii) A complete and detailed description of the specific accounting or auditing relief you seek.

        (2) You may file a single request for multiple marginal properties if you are requesting the same relief for all properties.

        § 1204.206   What will ONRR do when it receives my request for other relief?

#### § § 1204.206

        When ONRR receives your request for other relief under § 1204.205(b), it will notify you in writing as follows:

        (a) If your request for relief is complete, ONRR may either approve, deny, or modify your request in writing after consultation with any State required under § 1204.207(b).

        (1) If ONRR approves your request for relief, ONRR will notify you of the effective date of your accounting or auditing relief and other specifics of the relief approved.

        (2) If ONRR denies your relief request, ONRR will notify you of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.

        (3) If ONRR modifies your relief request, ONRR will notify you of the modifications.

        (i) You have 60 days from your receipt of ONRR's notice to either accept or reject any modification(s) in writing.

        (ii) If you reject the modification(s) or fail to respond to ONRR's notice, ONRR will deny your relief request. ONRR will notify you in writing of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.

        (b) If your request for relief is not complete, ONRR will notify you in writing that your request is incomplete and identify any missing information.

        (1) You must submit the missing information within 60 days of your receipt of ONRR's notice that your request is incomplete.

        (2) After you submit all required information, ONRR may approve, deny, or modify your request for relief under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (3) If you do not submit all required information within 60 days of your receipt of ONRR's notice that your request is incomplete, ONRR will deny your relief request. ONRR will notify you in writing of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.

        (4) You may submit a new request for relief under this subpart at any time after ONRR returns your incomplete request.

> [69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 30200, May 22, 2013]

        § 1204.207   Who will approve, deny, or modify my request for accounting and auditing relief?

#### § § 1204.207

        (a) If there is not a State concerned for your marginal property, only ONRR will decide whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief request.

        (b) If there is a State concerned for your marginal property that has determined in advance under § 1204.208 that it will allow either or both of the relief options under this subpart, ONRR will decide whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief request after consulting with the State concerned.

> [69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 76 FR 38561, July 1, 2011]

        § 1204.208   May a State decide that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options under this subpart?

#### § § 1204.208

        (a) A State may decide in advance that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart for a particular calendar year. If a State decides that it will not consent to one or both of the relief options, ONRR will not grant that type of marginal property relief.

        (b) To help States decide whether to allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart, for each calendar year ONRR will send States a Report of Marginal Properties by October 1 preceding the calendar year.

        (c) If a State decides under paragraph (a) of this section that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart during the next calendar year, within 30 days of the State's receipt of the Report of Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must:

        (1) Notify the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue, in writing, of its intent to allow or not allow one or both of the relief options under this subpart; and

        (2) Specify in its notice of intent to ONRR which relief option(s) it will allow or not allow.

        (d) If a State decides in advance under paragraph (a) of this section that it will not allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart, it may decide for subsequent calendar years that it will allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart. If it so decides, within 30 days of the State's receipt of the Report of Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must:

        (1) Notify the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue, in writing, of its intent to allow one or both of the relief options allowed under this subpart during the next calendar year; and

        (2) Specify in its notice of intent to ONRR which relief option(s) it will allow.

        (e) If a State does not notify ONRR under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the State will be deemed to have decided not to allow either of the relief options under this subpart for the next calendar year.

        (f) ONRR will publish a notice of the State's intent to allow or not allow certain relief options under this section in the  no later than 30 days before the beginning of the applicable calendar year.

        § 1204.209   What if a property ceases to qualify for relief obtained under this subpart?

#### § § 1204.209

        (a) A marginal property must qualify for relief under this subpart for each calendar year based on production during the base period for that calendar year. The notice or request you provided to ONRR under § 1204.205 for the first calendar year that the property qualified for relief remains effective for successive calendar years if the property continues to qualify.

        (b) If a property is no longer eligible for relief for any reason during a calendar year other than the reason under § 1204.210 or paragraph (c) of this section, the relief for the property terminates as of December 31 of that calendar year. You must notify ONRR in writing by December 31 that the relief for the property has terminated.

        (c) If you dispose of your interest in a marginal property during the calendar year, your relief terminates as of the end of the sales month in which you disposed of the property. Report and pay royalties for your production using the procedures in § 1204.202(e).

        § 1204.210   What if a property is approved as part of a nonqualifying agreement?

#### § § 1204.210

        If the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or BOEM retroactively approves a marginal property that qualified for relief for inclusion as part of an agreement that does not qualify for relief under this subpart, the property no longer qualifies for relief under this subpart then:

        (a) ONRR will not retroactively rescind the marginal property relief for production from your property under § 1204.211;

        (b) Your marginal property relief terminates as of December 31 of the calendar year that you receive the BLM or BOEM approval of your marginal property as part of a nonqualifying agreement; and

        (c) For the calendar year in which you receive the BLM or BOEMRE approval, and for any previous period affected by the approval, the volumes on which you report and pay royalty for your lease must be amended to reflect all volumes produced on or allocated to your lease under the nonqualifying agreement as modified by BLM or BOEM. Report and pay royalties for your production using the procedures in § 1204.202(b).

        (d) If you owe additional royalties based on the retroactive agreement approval and do not pay your royalty by the date due in § 1204.202(b), you will owe late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your payment was due under § 1204.202 (b)(2) until the date ONRR receives it.

        § 1204.211   When may ONRR rescind relief for a property?

#### § § 1204.211

        (a) ONRR may retroactively rescind the relief for your property if ONRR determines that your property was not eligible for the relief obtained under this subpart because:

        (1) You did not submit a notice or request for relief under § 1204.205;

        (2) You submitted erroneous information in the notice or request for relief you provided to ONRR under § 1204.205 or in your royalty or production reports; or

        (3) Your property is no longer eligible for relief because production increased, but you failed to provide the notice required under § 1204.209(b).

        (b) ONRR may rescind relief for your property if ONRR decides to take royalty in kind.

        § 1204.212   What if I took relief for which I was ineligible?

#### § § 1204.212

        If you took relief under this subpart for a period for which you were not eligible, you:

        (a) May owe additional royalties and late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your additional payments were due until the date ONRR receives them; and

        (b) May be subject to civil penalties.

        § 1204.213   May I obtain relief for a property that benefits from other Federal or State incentive programs?

#### § § 1204.213

        You may obtain accounting and auditing relief for production from a marginal property under this subpart even if the property benefits from other Federal or State production incentive programs.

        § 1204.214   Is minimum royalty due on a property for which I took relief?

#### § § 1204.214

        (a) If you took cumulative royalty reports and payment relief on a property under this subpart, minimum royalty is still due for that property by the date prescribed in your lease and in the amount prescribed therein.

        (b) If you pay minimum royalty on production from a marginal property during a calendar year for which you are taking cumulative royalty reports and payment relief, and:

        (1) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is greater than the minimum royalty you paid, you must pay the difference between the minimum royalty you paid and your annual payment due under this subpart; or

        (2) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is less than the minimum royalty you paid, you are not entitled to a credit because you must pay at least the minimum royalty amount on your lease each year.

        § 1204.215   Are the information collection requirements in this subpart approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)?

#### § § 1204.215

        (1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of non-control that ONRR may rebut.

        (2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person, ONRR will consider each of the following factors to determine if there is control under the circumstances of a particular case:

        (i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors.

        (ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership or other forms of ownership: The percentage of ownership or common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, if a person is the greatest single owner, or if there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership.

        (iii) Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility.

        (iv) The extent of others owners' participation in operations and day-to-day management of a lease, plant, or other facility.

        means the person whom the lessee designates to report and pay the lessee's royalties for a lease.

        means an agreement where one person agrees to deliver oil to another person at a specified location in exchange for oil deliveries at another location. _Exchange agreement_s may or may not specify prices for the oil involved. They frequently specify dollar amounts reflecting location, quality, or other differentials. Exchange agreements include buy/sell agreements, which specify prices to be paid at each exchange point and may appear to be two separate sales within the same agreement. Examples of other types of exchange agreements include, but are not limited to, exchanges of produced oil for specific types of crude oil (such as West Texas Intermediate); exchanges of produced oil for other crude oil at other locations (Location Trades); exchanges of produced oil for other grades of oil (Grade Trades); and multi-party exchanges.

        means Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

        mean a geographic region _s_ituated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs and encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known within those reservoirs, vertically projected to the land surface.

        means any fluid, either combustible or non-combustible, hydrocarbon or non-hydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.

        means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas, excluding residue gas.

        means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off of the lease, unit, or communitized area that BLM or BSEE approves for onshore and offshore leases, respectively, including any movement of bulk production from the wellhead to a platform offshore.

        means, for Federal gas, an area at least as large as the defined limits of an oil and or gas field in which oil and/or gas lease products have similar quality and economic characteristics.

        means the total monies and other consideration accruing for the disposition of any of the following:

        (1)  Gross proceeds also include, but are not limited to, the following examples:

        (i) Payments for services such as dehydration, marketing, measurement, or gathering which the lessee must perform at no cost to the Federal Government.

        means a processing agreement under which the processor delivers to the lessee a quantity of gas after processing equivalent to the quantity of gas that the processor received from the lessee prior to processing, normally based on heat content, less gas used as plant fuel and gas unaccounted for and/or lost. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements under which the processor retains all NGLs that it recovered from the lessee's gas.

        means any contract, profit-sharing arrangement, joint venture, or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under any mineral leasing law, including the Indian Mineral Development Act, 25 U.S.C. 2101-2108, that authorizes exploration for, extraction of, or removal of lease products.

        means similar chemical and physical characteristics.

        means an amount paid or received (whether in money or in barrels of oil) under an exchange agreement that results from differences in location between oil delivered in exchange and oil received in the exchange. A location differential may represent all or part of the difference between the price received for oil delivered and the price paid for oil received under a buy/sell exchange agreement.

        means a major point that ONRR recognizes for oil sales, refining, or transshipment. _Market center_s generally are locations where ONRR-approved publications publish oil spot prices.

        means lease products which are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or area for Federal oil and gas.

        (2) Second, divide the sum by the number of days on which those prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays).

        means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs, remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities, and is marketed or used as a liquid. Condensate recovered in lease separators or field facilities is oil.

        means the Office of Natural Resources Revenue of the Department of the Interior.

        means a publication that ONRR approves for determining NGLs prices.

        means:

        means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as follows: _Roll_ = .6667 × (P−P) + .3333 × (P−P), where: P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the month following the month of production, published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; and P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month following the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays).

        (**1**)  The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December. December was the prompt month (for year **2***0*11) from October 21 through November 18. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. P therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. In this example, assume that P = $95.08 per bbl, P = $95.03 per bbl, and P = $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 × ($95.08−$95.03) + .3333 × ($95.08−$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.

        (**2**)  The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November. November was the prompt month (for year 2*0***1**2) from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. P therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P = $91.28 per bbl, P = $91.65 per bbl, and P = $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 × ($91.28−$91.65) + .3333 × ($91.28−$92.10) = (−$0.25) + (−$0.27) = (−$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively, a subtraction from the NYMEX price).

        means a contract between two persons where:

        (1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil, gas, or gas plant product to the buyer and does not retain any related rights, such as the right to buy back similar quantities of oil, gas, or gas plant product from the buyer elsewhere;

        (2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil, gas, or gas plant product; and

        (3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil, gas, or gas plant product to occur.

        means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.

        means the price under a spot sales contract where:

        (1) A seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a specified period of short duration.

        (2) No cancellation notice is required to terminate the sales agreement.

        (3) There is no obligation or implied intent to continue to sell in subsequent periods.

        means the period extending from the second business day before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX publishes a different definition or different dates on its official website, , in which case, the NYMEX definition will apply.

        means a deduction in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs that the lessee incurs for moving:

        (1) Oil to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.

        (2) Unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.

        means the average of the daily mean differentials for location and quality between a grade of crude oil at a market center and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil at Cushing published for each day for which price publications perform surveys for deliveries during the production month, calculated over the number of days on which those differentials are published (excluding weekends and holidays). Calculate the daily mean differentials by averaging the daily high and low differentials for the month in the selected publication. Use only the days and corresponding differentials for which such differentials are published.

      Subpart B—Indian Oil

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 24805, May 1, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1206.50   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1206.50

        (a) This subpart applies to all oil produced from Indian (Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma). This subpart does not apply to Federal leases, including Federal leases for which revenues are shared with Alaska Native Corporations. This subpart:

        (1) Explains how you as a lessee must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with Indian mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.

        (2) Ensures the United States discharges its trust responsibilities for administering Indian oil and gas leases under the governing Indian mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.

        (b) If you dispose of or report production on behalf of a lessee, the terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to you and not to the lessee. In this circumstance, you must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to your disposition of the lessee's oil.

        (c) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with:

        (1) A Federal statute;

        (2) A settlement agreement between the United States, Indian lessor, and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation;

        (3) A written agreement between the Indian lessor, lessee, and the ONRR Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects at least would approximate the value established under this subpart; or

        (4) An express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

        (d) ONRR or Indian Tribes, which have a cooperative agreement with ONRR to audit under 30 U.S.C. 1732, may audit, or perform other compliance reviews, and require a lessee to adjust royalty payments and reports.

        § 1206.51   What definitions apply to this subpart?

#### § § 1206.51

        For purposes of this subpart:

        means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person.

        (1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of non-control that ONRR may rebut.

        (2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person, ONRR will consider the following factors in determining whether there is control in a particular case:

        (i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors;

        (ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership:

        (A) The percentage of ownership or common ownership;

        (B) The relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons;

        (C) Whether a person is the greatest single owner; and

        (D) Whether there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;

The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.

        means the nearest month of delivery for which NYMEX futures prices are published during the trading month.

        means an amount paid or received under an exchange agreement (whether in money or in barrels of oil) that results from differences in API gravity, sulfur content, viscosity, metals content, and other quality factors between oil delivered and oil received in the exchange.

        means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as follows: _Roll_ = .6667 × (P−P) + .3333 × (P−P), where: P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the month following the month of production, published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; and P = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month following the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays). ONRR reserves the option of terminating the use of the roll when ONRR believes that the roll is no longer a common industry practice. ONRR also retains the option to redefine how to calculate the roll to comport with changes in industry practice. To terminate or otherwise redefine how to calculate the roll, ONRR will explain its rationale for terminating or redefining how to calculate the roll by publishing a notice in the  to provide an opportunity for comment.

        (**1**)  The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December **2***0*12. December was the prompt month from October 23 through November 20. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. P therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. In this example, assume that P = $95.08 per bbl; P = $95.03 per bbl; and P = $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 × ($95.08−$95.03) + .3333 × ($95.08−$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.

        (**2**)  The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November 2*0***1**2. November was the prompt month from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. P therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P = $91.28 per bbl; P = $91.65 per bbl; and P = $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 × ($91.28−$91.65) + .3333 × ($91.28−$92.10) = (−$0.25) + (−$0.27) = (−$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively a subtraction from the NYMEX price).

        means a contract between two persons where:

        (1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil to the buyer and does not retain any related rights, such as the right to buy back similar quantities of oil from the buyer elsewhere.

        (2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil.

        (3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil to occur.

        means the contract type or general disposition ( arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation allowance.

        means the period extending from the second business day before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX publishes a different definition or different dates on its official Web site,  in which case, the NYMEX definition will apply.

        means a deduction in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs of moving oil to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.

        means West Texas Intermediate.

        means a lessee, operator, or other person who pays royalties under this subpart.

        § 1206.52   How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my affiliate sell(s) or exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.52

        (a) The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54. The value of oil under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the arm's-length contract, less applicable allowances determined under § 1206.56 or § 1206.57. You must use this paragraph (a) to value oil when:

        (1) You sell under an arm's-length sales contract.

        (2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract.

        (b) If you have multiple arm's-length contracts to sell oil produced from a lease that is valued under paragraph (a) of this section, the value of the oil is the higher of the volume-weighted average of the values established under this section for all contracts for the sale of oil produced from that lease or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54.

        (c) If ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate does not reflect the reasonable value of the production due to either:

        (1) Misconduct by or between the parties to the arm's-length contract; or

        (2) Breach of your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor, ONRR will establish a value based on other relevant matters.

        (i) ONRR will not use this provision to simply substitute its judgment of the market value of the oil for the proceeds received by the seller under an arm's-length sales contract.

        (ii) The fact that the price received by the seller under an arm's-length contract is less than other measures of market price is insufficient to establish breach of the duty to market unless ONRR finds additional evidence that the seller acted unreasonably or in bad faith in the sale of oil produced from the lease.

        (d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

        (e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.

        (f) You must base value on the highest price that you or your affiliate can receive through legally enforceable claims under the oil sales contract.

        (1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.

        (2) If you or your affiliate make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract—but the purchaser refuses—and you or your affiliate take reasonable documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph (f)(2) to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part, or in a timely manner, for a quantity of oil.

        (g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.

        (2) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 of the  to the contrary.

        (h) If you or your affiliate enter(s) into an arm's-length exchange agreement, or multiple sequential arm's-length exchange agreements, then you must value your oil under this paragraph (h).

        (1) If you or your affiliate exchange(s) oil at arm's length for WTI or equivalent oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, you must value the oil using the NYMEX price, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and any transportation costs under paragraph (h)(4) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58.

        (2) If you do not exchange oil for WTI or equivalent oil at Cushing, but exchange it at arm's length for oil at another location and following the arm's-length exchange(s) you or your affiliate sell(s) the oil received in the exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract, then you must use the gross proceeds under your or your affiliate's arm's-length sales contract after the exchange(s) occur(s), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and any transportation costs under paragraph (h)(4) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58.

        (3) You must adjust your gross proceeds for any location or quality differential, or other adjustments, that you received or paid under the arm's-length exchange agreement(s). If ONRR determines that any exchange agreement does not reflect reasonable location or quality differentials, ONRR may adjust the differentials that you used based on relevant information. You may not otherwise use the price or differential specified in an arm's-length exchange agreement to value your production.

        (4) If you value oil under this paragraph (h), ONRR will allow a deduction, under §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, for the reasonable, actual costs to transport the oil:

        (i) From the lease to a point where oil is given in exchange.

        (ii) If oil is not exchanged to Cushing, Oklahoma, from the point where oil is received in exchange to the point where the oil received in exchange is sold.

        (5) If you or your affiliate exchange(s) your oil at arm's length, and neither paragraph (h)(1) nor (2) of this section applies, ONRR will establish a value for the oil based on relevant matters. After ONRR establishes the value, you must report and pay royalties and any late payment interest owed based on that value.

        § 1206.53   How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my affiliate do(es) not sell under an arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.53

        (a) The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54. The unit value of your oil not sold under an arm's-length contract under this section for royalty purposes is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds paid or received by you or your affiliate, including your refining affiliate, for purchases or sales under arm's-length contracts.

        (1) When calculating that unit value, use only purchases or sales of other like-quality oil produced from the field (or the same area if you do not have sufficient arm's-length purchases or sales of oil produced from the field) during the production month.

        (2) You may adjust the gross proceeds determined under paragraph (a) of this section for transportation costs under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58 before including those proceeds in the volume-weighted average calculation.

        (3) If you have purchases away from the field(s) and cannot calculate a price in the field because you cannot determine the seller's cost of transportation that would be allowed under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, you must not include those purchases in your volume-weighted average calculation.

        (b) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliate's arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease. Use applicable gravity adjustment tables for the field (or the same general area for like-quality oil if you do not have gravity adjustment tables for the specific field) to normalize for gravity, as shown in the example below.

        (1)  Assume that a lessee, who owns a refinery and refines the oil produced from the lease at that refinery, purchases like-quality oil from other producers in the same field at arm's length for use as feedstock in its refinery. Further assume that the oil produced from the lease that is being valued under this section is Wyoming general sour with an API gravity of 23.5°. Assume that the refinery purchases at arm's-length oil (all of which must be Wyoming general sour) in the following volumes of the API gravities stated at the prices and locations indicated:

        (2)  Because the lessee does not know the costs that the seller of the 8,000 bbl incurred to transport that volume to the refinery, that volume will not be included in the volume-weighted average price calculation. Further assume that the gravity adjustment scale provides for a deduction of $0.02 per   degree API gravity below 34°. Normalized to 23.5° (the gravity of the oil being valued under this section), the prices of each of the volumes that the refiner purchased that are included in the volume-weighted average calculation are as follows:

        (3)  The volume-weighted average price is ((10,000 bbl × $34.50/bbl) + (9,000 bbl × $33.35/bbl) + (4,000 bbl × $33.30/bbl)) / 23,000 bbl = $33.84/bbl. That price will be the value of the oil produced from the lease and refined prior to an arm's-length sale under this section.

        (c) If you value oil under this section, ONRR will allow a deduction, under §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, for the reasonable, actual costs:

        (1) That you incur to transport oil that you or your affiliate sell(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average price calculation, from the lease to the point where the oil is sold.

        (2) That the seller incurs to transport oil that you or your affiliate purchase(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average cost calculation, from the property where it is produced to the point where you or your affiliate purchase(s) it. You may not deduct any costs of gathering as part of a transportation deduction or allowance.

        (d) If paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.

        § 1206.54   How do I fulfill the lease provision regarding valuing production on the basis of the major portion of like-quality oil?

#### § § 1206.54

        (a) This section applies to any Indian leases that contain a major portion provision for determining value for royalty purposes. This section also applies to any Indian leases that provide that the Secretary may establish value for royalty purposes. The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the gross proceeds you calculated under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53.

        (b) You must submit a monthly Form ONRR-2014 using the higher of the IBMP value determined under this section or your gross proceeds under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53. Your Form ONRR-2014 must meet the requirements of 30 CFR 1210.61.

        (c) ONRR will determine the monthly IBMP value for each designated area and crude oil type and post those values on our Web site at  The monthly IBMP value by designated area and crude oil type is calculated as follows:

        (1) For Indian leases located in Oklahoma:

        (2) For all other Indian leases:

        (d) ONRR will calculate the initial LCTD for each designated area (the same designated areas posted on its Web site at ) and crude oil type using the following formula:

        (1) For the first full production month after July 1, 2015, ONRR will calculate the monthly Major Portion Prices using data reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the previous 12 production months prior to July 1, 2015 (Previous Twelve Months). To the extent that ONRR does not have data on the Form ONRR-2014 regarding the crude oil type for the entire previous twelve months, ONRR will assume the crude oil type is the same for those months for which ONRR does not have data as the months for which the crude oil type was reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the same leases and/or agreements.

        (i) ONRR will array the calculated prices net of transportation by month from highest to lowest price for each designated area and crude oil type. For each month, ONRR will calculate the Major Portion Price as that price at which 25 percent plus 1 barrel (by volume) of the oil (starting from the highest) is sold.

        (ii) To calculate the average of the monthly Major Portion Prices for the previous 12 months, ONRR will add the monthly Major Portion Prices calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and divide by 12.

        (2) For every month following the first full production month after July 1, 2015, ONRR will monitor the LCTD using data reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the month ending two months before the current production month.

        (i) ONRR will use the oil sales volume that lessees report on Form ONRR-2014 to monitor and, if necessary, to modify the LCTD used in the IBMP value.

        (ii) ONRR will monitor oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX, as provided in 30 CFR 1210.61(a) and (b), on the Form ONRR-2014 on a monthly basis by designated area and crude oil type.

        (iii) If the monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX varies more than ± 3 percent from 25 percent of the total reported oil sales volume for the month, then ONRR will revise the LCTD prospectively starting with the following month.

        (A) If monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX on Form ONRR-2014 by the designated area and crude oil type fall below 22 percent, ONRR will increase the LCTD by 10 percent every month until the monthly oil sales volumes reported under the sales type code for gross proceeds on Form ONRR-2014 fall within the ± 3 percent range. In Example 1, assume that the IBMP value is $81.06 and the LCTD for the designated area is 14.28 percent. In the table below, the Percent of Volume not reported as OINX is less than 22 percent, which triggers a modification to the LCTD. ONRR will adjust the LCTD upward by 10 percent (14.28 percent × 1.10). Therefore, for the next month, the LCTD will be 15.71 percent. In the following month, the IBMP value will equal the next month's NYMEX CMA multiplied by (1 − 0.1571). ONRR will continue to make adjustments in subsequent months until monthly sales volumes not reported as OINX fall within 22-28 percent of the total monthly sales volume.

        (B) If monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX on Form ONRR-2014 by designated area and crude oil type exceed 28 percent, then ONRR will decrease the LCTD by 10 percent every month until the monthly oil sales volumes reported under the sales type code for gross proceeds on Form ONRR-2014 fall within the ± 3 percent range. In Example 2, assume that the IBMP value is $81.06 and the LCTD is 14.28 percent. As noted in the table below, however, the Percent of Volume not reported as OINX is 32.69 percent, exceeding the 28 percent threshold, which triggers a modification to the LCTD. ONRR will adjust the LCTD downward by 10 percent (14.28 percent × 0.90). Therefore, for the next month, the LCTD will be 12.85 percent. In the following month, the IBMP will equal the next month's NYMEX CMA multiplied by (1−0.1285). ONRR will continue to make adjustments in subsequent months until monthly sales volumes reported as ARMS fall within 22-28 percent of the total monthly sales volume.

        (e) In designated areas where there is insufficient data reported to ONRR on Form ONRR-2014 to determine a differential for a specific crude oil type, ONRR will use its discretion to determine an appropriate IBMP value.

        § 1206.55   What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?

#### § § 1206.55

        (a) You must place oil in marketable condition and market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Indian lessor unless the lease agreement provides otherwise.

        (b) If you must use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract or your affiliate's gross proceeds under an arm's-length exchange agreement to determine value under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform in order to place the oil in marketable condition or to market the oil.

        § 1206.56   What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?

#### § § 1206.56

        (a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport oil from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs to reduce royalties where you did not incur any costs to move a particular volume of oil. ONRR will not grant a transportation allowance for transporting oil taken as Royalty-In-Kind (RIK).

        (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, your transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a sales type code may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil at the point of sale, as determined under § 1206.52. Transportation costs cannot be transferred between sales type codes or to other products.

        (2) Upon your request, ONRR may approve a transportation allowance deduction in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. You must demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitation prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception (using Form ONRR-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) must contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for ONRR to make a determination. Under no circumstances may the value, for royalty purposes, under any sales type code, be reduced to zero.

        (c) You must express transportation allowances for oil in dollars per barrel. If you or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-barrel basis, you must convert whatever consideration you or your affiliate are paid to a dollar-per-barrel equivalent.

        (d) You must allocate transportation costs among all products produced and transported as provided in § 1206.57.

        (e) All transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment.

        (f) If, after a review or audit, ONRR determines you have improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this subpart, then you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter or report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.

        (g) You may not deduct any costs of gathering as part of a transportation deduction or allowance.

        § 1206.57   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.57

        (a)  (1) If you incur transportation costs under an arm's-length contract, your transportation allowance is the reasonable, actual costs that you incur to transport oil under that contract. You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length.

        (2) You must submit to ONRR a copy of your arm's-length transportation contract(s) and all subsequent amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date that ONRR receives your report, which claims the allowance on Form ONRR-2014.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.

        (4)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must allocate the total transportation costs in a consistent and equitable manner to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(4)(i), you may not take an allowance for the costs of transporting lease production, which is not royalty-bearing, without ONRR's approval.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR shall approve the method unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.

        (5) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR.

        (i) You may use the oil transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation.

        (ii) You must submit to ONRR all available data to support your proposal.

        (iii) You must submit your initial proposal within 3 months after the last day of the month for which you request a transportation allowance, whichever is later (unless ONRR approves a longer period).

        (iv) ONRR will determine the oil transportation allowance based on your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.

        (6) Where an arm's-length sales contract price includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a transportation factor, ONRR will not consider the transportation factor to be a transportation allowance. You may use the transportation factor to determine your gross proceeds for the sale of the product. The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without ONRR's approval.

        (b)  (1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. You must provide the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.

        (2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allotted leases and with lessor approval on Tribal leases.

        (3) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.

        § 1206.58   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or have no contract?

#### § § 1206.58

        (a)  (1) If you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no contract, including those situations where you or your affiliate perform(s) transportation services for you, the transportation allowance is based on your reasonable, actual costs as provided in this paragraph (a)(1).

        (2) You must submit the actual cost information to support the allowance to ONRR on Form ONRR-4110, Oil Transportation Allowance Report, within 3 months after the end of the calendar year to which the allowance applies. However, ONRR may approve a longer time period. ONRR will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may require you to modify your actual transportation allowance deduction.

        (3) You must base a transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations on your actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment), which are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that the lessee can document.

        (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee can document.

        (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (iv) You may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable capital investment. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval from ONRR.

        (A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method, based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves, which the transportation system services, or on a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule the original transporter/lessee established for the purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system can be depreciated only once. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.

        (B) ONRR will allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section. No allowance will be provided for depreciation.

        (v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return you must use is the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and is effective during the reporting period. You must redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determined under paragraph (b) of this section).

        (4)(i) You must determine the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is transported, you must allocate costs to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have no value) and you must make such allocation in a consistent and equitable manner. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(4)(i), you may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing without ONRR's approval.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method unless we determine that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.

        (5) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.

        (i) You may use the oil transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues our determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation.

        (ii) You must submit to ONRR all available data to support your proposal.

        (iii) You must submit your initial proposal within 3 months after the last day of the month for which you request a transportation allowance (unless ONRR approves a longer period).

        (iv) ONRR will determine the oil transportation allowance based on your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.

        (6) You may apply to ONRR for an exception from the requirement that you compute actual costs under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

        (i) ONRR will grant the exception only if you have a tariff for the transportation system the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has approved for Indian leases.

        (ii) ONRR will deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that area.

        (iii) If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, ONRR will deny the exception request if:

        (A) No FERC cost analysis exists and the FERC has declined to investigate under ONRR timely objections upon filing.

        (B) The tariff significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined under this section.

        (b)  (1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. You must provide the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.

        (2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allotted leases and with lessor approval on Tribal leases.

        (3) ONRR may require you to submit all of the data that you used to prepare your Form ONRR-4110. You must submit the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR determines.

        (4) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.

        (5) If you are authorized to use your FERC-approved tariff as your transportation cost under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, you must follow the reporting requirements of § 1206.57(b).

        (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no cost will be allowed for oil transportation that results from payments (either volumetric or for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This section does not apply when the transportation allowance is based upon a FERC or State regulatory agency approved tariff.

        (d) The provisions of this section will apply to determine transportation costs when establishing value using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of transportation costs.

        § 1206.59   What interest applies if I improperly report a transportation allowance?

#### § § 1206.59

        (a) If you deduct a transportation allowance on Form ONRR-2014 without complying with the requirements of §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, you must pay additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.

        (b) If you erroneously report a transportation allowance that results in an underpayment of royalties, you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.

        § 1206.60   What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?

#### § § 1206.60

        (a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month that you were authorized to deduct a transportation allowance to the date that you repay the difference.

        (b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.

        (c) If you make an adjustment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, then you must submit a corrected Form ONRR-2014 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, using instructions that ONRR provides.

        § 1206.61   How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?

#### § § 1206.61

        (a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report, and, if ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR may direct you to use a different measure of royalty value.

        (2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter, or you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.

        (b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the oil. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, you must value the oil sold as the total consideration accruing to you or your affiliate.

        § 1206.62   How do I request a value determination?

#### § § 1206.62

        (a) You may request a value determination from ONRR regarding any oil produced. Your request must:

        (1) Be in writing.

        (2) Identify specifically all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases.

        (3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request.

        (4) Include copies of all relevant documents.

        (5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents).

        (6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.

        (b) In response to your request, ONRR may:

        (1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs issue a valuation determination.

        (2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance.

        (3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations.

        (ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals.

        (c)(1) A value determination that the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.

        (2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a value determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination, and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.

        (3) A value determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

        (d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, the Indian lessor, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.

        (1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable valuation criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or make a determination.

        (f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR or the Assistant Secretary based any determination or guidance takes precedence over the determination or guidance, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the determination or guidance.

        (g) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary generally will not retroactively modify or rescind a value determination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, unless:

        (1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts.

        (2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from the facts on which the guidance was based.

        (h) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.65.

        § 1206.63   How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?

#### § § 1206.63

        (a) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves.

        (b) If you determine the value of oil under § 1206.52, § 1206.53, or § 1206.54 based on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves for the lease, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.

        (c) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses incurred before the royalty settlement point unless BLM determines that any actual loss was unavoidable.

        § 1206.64   What records must I keep to support my calculations of value under this subpart?

#### § § 1206.64

        If you determine the value of your oil under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.

        (a) You must show:

        (1) How you calculated the value that you reported, including all adjustments for location, quality, and transportation.

        (2) How you complied with these rules.

        (b) On request, you must make available sales, volume, and transportation data for production that you sold, purchased, or obtained from the field or area. You must make this data available to ONRR, Indian representatives, or other authorized persons.

        (c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in §§ 1207.5, 1212.50, and 1212.51 of this chapter.

        (d) ONRR, Indian representatives, or other authorized persons may review and audit your data, and ONRR will direct you to use a different value if they determine that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.

        § 1206.65   Does ONRR protect information that I provide?

#### § § 1206.65

        (a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding the valuation of oil, including transportation allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.

        (b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.

        (c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.

      Subpart C—Federal Oil

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 62023, Oct. 1, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1206.100   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1206.100

        (a) This subpart applies to all oil produced from Federal oil and gas leases onshore and on the OCS. It explains how you, as a lessee, must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.

        (b) If you are a designee and if you dispose of production on behalf of a lessee, the terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to you and not to the lessee. In this circumstance, you must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to your disposition of the lessee's oil.

        (c) If you are a designee and only report for a lessee and do not dispose of the lessee's production, references to “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to the lessee and not the designee. In this circumstance, you as a designee must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to the lessee's disposition of its oil.

        (d) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a(an): Federal statute; settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation; written agreement between the lessee and ONRR's Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects would at least approximate the value established under this subpart; express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

        (e) ONRR may audit, monitor, or review and adjust all royalty payments.

        § 1206.101   How do I calculate royalty value for oil I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.101

        (a) The value of oil under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the arm's-length contract less applicable allowances determined under § 1206.111 or § 1206.112. This value does not apply if you exercise an option to use a different value provided in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2)(i) of this section or if ONRR decides to value your oil under § 1206.105. You must use this paragraph (a) to value oil when:

        (1) You sell under an arm's-length sales contract; OR

        (2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

        (b) If you have multiple arm's-length contracts to sell oil produced from a lease that is valued under paragraph (a) of this section, the value of the oil is the volume-weighted average of the values established under this section for each contract for the sale of oil produced from that lease.

        (c)(1) If you enter into an arm's-length exchange agreement, or multiple sequential arm's-length exchange agreements, and following the exchange(s) that you or your affiliate sell(s) the oil received in the exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract, then you may use either paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102 to value your production for royalty purposes. If you fail to make the election required under this paragraph, you may not make a retroactive election, and ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105.

        (i) If you use paragraph (a) of this section, your gross proceeds are the gross proceeds under your or your affiliate's arm's-length sales contract after the exchange(s) occur(s). You must adjust your gross proceeds for any location or quality differential, or other adjustments, that you received or paid under the arm's-length exchange agreement(s). If ONRR determines that any arm's-length exchange agreement does not reflect reasonable location or quality differentials, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105. You may not otherwise use the price or differential specified in an arm's-length exchange agreement to value your production.

        (ii) When you elect under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to use paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102, you must make the same election for all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) sold under arm's-length contracts following arm's-length exchange agreements. You may not change your election more often than once every two years.

        (2)(i) If you sell or transfer your oil production to your affiliate, and that affiliate or another affiliate then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract, you may use either paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102 to value your production for royalty purposes.

        (ii) When you elect under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to use paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102, you must make the same election for all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that your affiliates resell at arm's-length. You may not change your election more often than once every two years.

        § 1206.102   How do I value oil not sold under an arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.102

        This section explains how to value oil that you may not value under § 1206.101 or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section, unless ONRR decides to value your oil under 1206.105. First, determine if paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section applies to production from your lease, or if you may apply paragraph (d) or (e) of this section with ONRR's approval.

        (a)  Value is the average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any ONRR-approved publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production month. For example, if the production month is June, calculate the average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices published in the ONRR-approved publication for all of the business days in June.

        (1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, you must average the daily high and low prices for the month in the selected publication.

        (2) You must use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such prices are published.

        (3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under § 1206.111.

        (4) After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.

        (b)  This paragraph provides methods and options for valuing your production under different factual situations. You must consistently apply paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section to value all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease or a portion of the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that you cannot value under § 1206.101 or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section.

        (1) You may elect to value your oil under either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section. After you select either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, you may not change to the other method more often than once every two years, unless the method you have been using is no longer applicable and you must apply the other paragraph. If you change methods, you must begin a new two-year period.

        (2) Value is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds accruing to the seller under your or your affiliate's arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale of production from the field or area during the production month.

        (i) The total volume purchased or sold under those contracts must exceed 50 percent of your and your affiliate's production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the same field or area during that month.

        (ii) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliate's arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease.

        (3) Value is the NYMEX price (without the roll), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.

        (4) If you demonstrate to ONRR's satisfaction that paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.

        (c)

        (1) Value is the NYMEX price, plus the roll, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.

        (2) If ONRR's Director determines that the use of the roll no longer reflects prevailing industry practice in crude oil sales contracts or that the most common formula that industry uses to calculate the roll changes, ONRR may terminate or modify the use of the roll under paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the end of each two-year period as of January 1, 2017, through a notice published in the  not later than 60 days before the end of the two-year period. ONRR will explain the rationale for terminating or modifying the use of the roll in this notice.

        (d)  If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.

        (e)  If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.

        § 1206.103   What publications does ONRR approve?

#### § § 1206.103

        (a) ONRR will periodically publish on  a list of ONRR-approved publications for the NYMEX price and ANS spot price based on certain criteria including, but not limited to:

        (1) Publications buyers and sellers frequently use.

        (2) Publications frequently mentioned in purchase or sales contracts.

        (3) Publications that use adequate survey techniques, including development of estimates based on daily surveys of buyers and sellers of crude oil, and, for ANS spot prices, buyers and sellers of ANS crude oil.

        (4) Publications independent from ONRR, other lessors, and lessees.

        (b) Any publication may petition ONRR to be added to the list of acceptable publications.

        (c) ONRR will specify the tables that you must use in the acceptable publications.

        (d) ONRR may revoke its approval of a particular publication if we determine that the prices or differentials published in the publication do not accurately represent NYMEX prices or differentials or ANS spot market prices or differentials.

        § 1206.104   How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?

#### § § 1206.104

        (a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report, and, if ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR may direct you to use a different measure of royalty value or decide your value under § 1206.105.

        (2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must either pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter), or report a credit for—or request a refund of—any overpaid royalties.

        (b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or to your affiliate for the oil. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105.

        (c) ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105 if ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under a contract do not reflect reasonable consideration because:

        (1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties; or

        (2) You have breached your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by selling your oil at a value that is unreasonably low. ONRR may consider a sales price to be unreasonably low if it is 10 percent less than the lowest reasonable measures of market price including—but not limited to—index prices and prices reported to ONRR for like quality oil; or

        (3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly valued your oil under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102 for any reason including—but not limited to—your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.

        (d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

        (e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.

        (f)(1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.

        (2) If you or your affiliate apply in a timely manner for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract, but the purchaser refuses and you or your affiliate take reasonable documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or in a timely manner, for a quantity of oil.

        (g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.

        (2) If you or your affiliate fail(s) to comply with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, ONRR may determine your value under § 1206.105.

        (3) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 to the contrary.

        § 1206.105   How will ONRR determine the value of my oil for royalty purposes?

#### § § 1206.105

        If ONRR decides that we will value your oil for royalty purposes under § 1206.104, or any other provision in this subpart, then we will determine value, for royalty purposes, by considering any information that we deem relevant, which may include, but is not limited to, the following:

        § 1206.106   What records must I keep to support my calculations of value under this subpart?

#### § § 1206.106

        If you determine the value of your oil under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.

        (a) You must show both of the following:

        (1) How you calculated the value that you reported, including all adjustments for location, quality, and transportation.

        (2) How you complied with these rules.

        (b) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        (c) ONRR may review and audit your data, and ONRR will direct you to use a different value if we determine that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.

        § 1206.107   What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?

#### § § 1206.107

        (a) You must place oil in marketable condition and market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal government.

        (b) If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract in determining value, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform to place the oil in marketable condition or to market the oil.

        § 1206.108   How do I request a valuation determination?

#### § § 1206.108

        (a) You may request a valuation determination from ONRR regarding any oil produced. Your request must:

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Identify, specifically, all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases;

        (3) Completely explain all relevant facts; you must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request;

        (4) Include copies of all relevant documents;

        (5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and

        (6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.

        (b) In response to your request, ONRR may:

        (1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget issue a valuation determination;

        (2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance; or

        (3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to, the following:

        (c)(1) A valuation determination that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.

        (2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a valuation determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (3) A valuation determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

        (d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, delegated States, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.

        (1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable valuation criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or to make a determination.

        (f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR or the Assistant Secretary based any determination or guidance takes precedence over the determination or guidance, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the determination or guidance.

        (g) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary generally will not retroactively modify or rescind a valuation determination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, unless:

        (1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts; or

        (2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from the facts on which the guidance was based.

        (h) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.109.

        § 1206.109   Does ONRR protect information that I provide?

#### § § 1206.109

        (a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding valuation of oil, including transportation allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.

        (b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.

        (c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.

        § 1206.110   What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?

#### § § 1206.110

        (a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport oil from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.110, § 1206.111, or § 1206.112, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs that you incur to move a particular volume of production to reduce royalties that you owe on production for which you did not incur those costs. This paragraph applies when:

        (1)(i) The movement to the sales point is not gathering;

        (ii) For oil produced on the OCS, the movement of oil from the wellhead to the first platform is not transportation; and

        (2) You value oil under § 1206.101 based on a sale at a point off of the lease, unit, or communitized area where the oil is produced; or

        (3) You do not value your oil under § 1206.102(a)(3) or (b)(3).

        (b) You must calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. If your or your affiliate's transportation contract includes more than one liquid product, you must allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the liquid products that are transported. Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding waste products with no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products with no value).

        (1) You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

        (2) You may propose to ONRR a prospective cost allocation method based on the values of the liquid products transported. ONRR will approve the method if it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.

        (3) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your proposed procedure until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest.

        (c)(1) Where you or your affiliate transport(s) both gaseous and liquid products through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.

        (2) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty and interest due.

        (3) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available data, within three months after you first claim the allocated deductions on form ONRR-2014.

        (d)(1) Your transportation allowance may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil, as determined under § 1206.101 of this subpart.

        (2) If ONRR approved your request to take a transportation allowance in excess of the 50-percent limitation under former § 1206.109(c), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.

        (e) You must express transportation allowances for oil as a dollar-value equivalent. If your or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration you or your affiliate are paid to a dollar-value equivalent.

        (f) ONRR may determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.105 because:

        (1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;

        (2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the transportation because you breached your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by transporting your oil at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a transportation allowance to be unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of transportation costs including, but not limited to, transportation allowances reported to ONRR and tariffs for gas, residue gas, or gas plant product transported through the same system; or

        (3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a transportation allowance under § 1206.111 or § 1206.112 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.

        (g) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance.

        § 1206.111   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.111

        (a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 1206.110(f) and subject to the limitation in § 1206.110(d).

        (2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is at arm's-length.

        (3) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance for costs incurred under an arm's-length transportation contract.

        (b) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, you may include, but are not limited to, the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section; you may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section including, but not limited to:

        (1) The amount that you pay under your arm's-length transportation contract or tariff.

        (2) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or theoretical line losses.

        (3) Fees paid for administration of a quality bank.

        (4) Fees paid to a terminal operator for loading and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance.

        (5) Fees paid for short-term storage (30 days or less) incidental to transportation as a transporter requires.

        (6) Fees paid to pump oil to another carrier's system or vehicles as required under a tariff.

        (7) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.

        (8) Payments for a volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower gravity crude oil for transportation.

        (9) Costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you, as a shipper, to maintain.

        (10) Hurricane surcharges that you or your affiliate actually pay(s).

        (11) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil that the pipeline operator requires you, as a shipper, to maintain and that you do maintain in the line as line fill. You must calculate this cost as follows:

        (i) First, multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the pipeline by the value of that volume for the current month calculated under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102, as applicable.

        (ii) Second, multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate of return specified in § 1206.112(i)(3) by 12.

        (c) You may not include the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days)

        (2) Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with terminalling

        (3) Title and terminal transfer fees

        (4) Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a market center or to avoid paying title transfer fees

        (5) Fees paid to brokers

        (6) Fees paid to a scheduling service provider

        (7) Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production

        (8) Gauging fees

        (d) If you have no written contract for the arm's-length transportation of oil, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.105. You may not use this paragraph (d) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.

        (1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.108(a).

        (2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues its determination.

        § 1206.112   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I do not have an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.112

        (a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do(es) not have an arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or your affiliate provide your own transportation services. You must calculate your transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the procedures prescribed in this section.

        (b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs may include the following:

        (1) Capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.

        (2) Overhead under paragraph (h) of this section.

        (3)(i) Depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or you may elect to use a cost equal to a return on the initial depreciable capital investment in the transportation system under paragraph (i)(2) of this section. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (ii) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section after you have depreciated the transportation system to its reasonable salvage value.

        (c) To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section.

        (1) If you or your affiliate incur(s) the following actual costs under your or your affiliate's non-arm's-length contract, you may include these costs in your calculations under this section:

        (i) Fees paid to a non-affiliated terminal operator for loading and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance

        (ii) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at the hub; these fees do not include title transfer fees

        (iii) A volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower gravity crude oil for transportation

        (iv) Fees paid to a non-affiliated quality bank administrator for administration of a quality bank

        (v) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil that the pipeline operator requires you, as a shipper, to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the line as line fill; you must calculate this cost as follows:

        (A) First, multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the pipeline by the value of that volume for the current month calculated under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102, as applicable.

        (B) Second, multiply the value calculated under paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate of return specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section by 12.

        (2) You may not include in your transportation allowance:

        (i) Any of the costs identified under § 1206.111(c); and/or

        (ii) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or theoretical line losses.

        (d) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.

        (e) Allowable capital investment costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including the costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (f) Allowable operating expenses include the following:

        (1) Operations supervision and engineering

        (2) Operations labor

        (3) Fuel

        (4) Utilities

        (5) Materials

        (6) Ad valorem property taxes

        (7) Rent

        (8) Supplies

        (9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that you can document

        (g) Allowable maintenance expenses include the following:

        (1) Maintenance of the transportation system

        (2) Maintenance of equipment

        (3) Maintenance labor

        (4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document

        (h) Overhead, directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system, is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (i)(1) To calculate depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method (based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the transportation system services), or you may elect to use a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (i) A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation.

        (ii) You may depreciate a transportation system, with or without a change in ownership, only once.

        (iii)(A) To calculate the return on undepreciated capital investment, you may use an amount equal to the undepreciated capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return that you determine under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (B) After you have depreciated a transportation system to the reasonable salvage value, you may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to the reasonable salvage value multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (2) As an alternative to using depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, you may use as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. You may not include depreciation in your allowance.

        (3) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating.

        (i) You must use the monthly average BBB rate that Standard & Poor's publishes for the first month for which the allowance is applicable.

        (ii) You must re-determine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        § 1206.113   What adjustments and transportation allowances apply when I value oil production from my lease using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices?

#### § § 1206.113

        This section applies when you use NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices to calculate the value of production under § 1206.102. As specified in this section, you must adjust the NYMEX price to reflect the difference in value between your lease and Cushing, Oklahoma, or adjust the ANS spot price to reflect the difference in value between your lease and the appropriate ONRR-recognized market center at which the ANS spot price is published (for example, Long Beach, California, or San Francisco, California). Paragraph (a) of this section explains how you adjust the value between the lease and the market center, and paragraph (b) of this section explains how you adjust the value between the market center and Cushing when you use NYMEX prices. Paragraph (c) of this section explains how adjustments may be made for quality differentials that are not accounted for through exchange agreements. Paragraph (d) of this section gives some examples. References in this section to “you” include your affiliates, as applicable.

        (a) To adjust the value between the lease and the market center:

        (1)(i) For oil that you exchange at arm's-length between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations), you must calculate a lease-to-market center differential by the applicable location and quality differentials derived from your arm's-length exchange agreement applicable to production during the production month.

        (ii) For oil that you exchange between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations) under an exchange agreement that is not at arm's-length, you must obtain approval from ONRR for a location and quality differential. Until you obtain such approval, you may use the location and quality differential derived from that exchange agreement applicable to production during the production month. If ONRR prescribes a different differential, you must apply ONRR's differential to all periods for which you used your proposed differential. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's differential, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties, plus interest, under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).

        (2) For oil that you transport between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations), you may take an allowance for the cost of transporting that oil between the relevant points, as determined under § 1206.111 or 1206.112, as applicable.

        (3) If you transport or exchange at arm's-length (or both transport and exchange) at least 20 percent—but not all—of your oil produced from the lease to a market center, you must determine the adjustment between the lease and the market center for the oil that is not transported or exchanged (or both transported and exchanged) to or through a market center as follows:

        (i) Determine the volume-weighted average of the lease-to-market center adjustment calculated under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for the oil that you do transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) from your lease to a market center.

        (ii) Use that volume-weighted average lease-to-market center adjustment as the adjustment for the oil that you do not transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) from your lease to a market center.

        (4) If you transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) less than 20 percent of the crude oil produced from your lease between the lease and a market center, you must propose to ONRR an adjustment between the lease and the market center for the portion of the oil that you do not transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) to a market center. Until you obtain such approval, you may use your proposed adjustment. If ONRR prescribes a different adjustment, you must apply ONRR's adjustment to all periods for which you used your proposed adjustment. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's adjustment, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).

        (5) You may not both take a transportation allowance and use a location and quality adjustment or exchange differential for the same oil between the same points.

        (b) For oil that you value using NYMEX prices, you must adjust the value between the market center and Cushing, Oklahoma, as follows:

        (1) If you have arm's-length exchange agreements between the market center and Cushing under which you exchange to Cushing at least 20 percent of all of the oil that you own at the market center during the production month, you must use the volume-weighted average of the location and quality differentials from those agreements as the adjustment between the market center and Cushing for all of the oil that you produce from the leases during that production month for which that market center is used.

        (2) If paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply, you must use the WTI differential published in an ONRR-approved publication for the market center nearest to your lease, for crude oil most similar in quality to your production, as the adjustment between the market center and Cushing. For example, for light sweet crude oil produced offshore of Louisiana, you must use the WTI differential for Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil at St. James, Louisiana. After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.

        (3) If neither paragraph (b)(1) nor (2) of this section applies, you may propose an alternative differential to ONRR. Until you obtain such approval, you may use your proposed differential. If ONRR prescribes a different differential, you must apply ONRR's differential to all periods for which you used your proposed differential. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's differential, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).

        (c)(1) If you adjust for location and quality differentials or for transportation costs under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you also must adjust the NYMEX price or ANS spot price for quality based on premiums or penalties determined by pipeline quality bank specifications at intermediate commingling points or at the market center if those points are downstream of the royalty measurement point that BSEE or BLM, as applicable, approve. You must make this adjustment only if, and to the extent that, such adjustments were not already included in the location and quality differentials determined from your arm's-length exchange agreements.

        (2) If the quality of your oil, as adjusted, is still different from the quality of the representative crude oil at the market center after making the quality adjustments described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(1) of this section, you may make further gravity adjustments using posted price gravity tables. If quality bank adjustments do not incorporate or provide for adjustments for sulfur content, you may make sulfur adjustments, based on the quality of the representative crude oil at the market center, of 5.0 cents per one-tenth percent difference in sulfur content.

        (i) You may request prior ONRR approval to use a different adjustment.

        (ii) If ONRR approves your request to use a different quality adjustment, you may begin using that adjustment for the production month following the month when ONRR received your request.

        (d) The examples in this paragraph illustrate how to apply the requirement of this section.

        (1)  Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Artesia, New Mexico. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Roswell, New Mexico, and then exchanges the oil to Midland, Texas. Assume that the lessee refines the oil received in exchange at Midland. Assume that the NYMEX price is $86.21/bbl, adjusted for the roll; that the WTI differential (Cushing to Midland) is−$2.27/bbl; that the lessee's exchange agreement between Roswell and Midland results in a location and quality differential of−$0.08/bbl; and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Artesia to Roswell is $0.40/bbl. In this example, the royalty value of the oil is $86.21−$2.27−$0.08−$0.40 = $83.46/bbl.

        (2)  Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that the lessee transports and exchanges to Midland 40 percent of the production from the lease near Artesia and transports the remaining 60 percent directly to its own refinery in Ohio. In this example, the 40 percent of the production would be valued at $83.46/bbl, as explained in the previous example. In this example, the other 60 percent also would be valued at $83.46/bbl.

        (3)  Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Bakersfield, California. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Hynes Station and then exchanges the oil to Cushing, which it further exchanges with oil that it refines. Assume that the ANS spot price is $105.65/bbl and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Bakersfield to Hynes Station is $0.28/bbl. The lessee must request approval from ONRR for a location and quality adjustment between Hynes Station and Long Beach. For example, the lessee likely would propose using the tariff on Line 63 from Hynes Station to Long Beach as the adjustment between those points. Assume that adjustment to be $0.72, including the sulfur and gravity bank adjustments, and that ONRR approves the lessee's request. In this example, the preliminary (because the location and quality adjustment is subject to ONRR's review) royalty value of the oil is $105.65 −$0.72 −$0.28 = $104.65/bbl. The fact that oil was exchanged to Cushing does not change the use of ANS spot prices for royalty valuation.

        § 1206.114   How will ONRR identify market centers?

#### § § 1206.114

        ONRR will monitor market activity and, if necessary, add to or modify the list of market centers that we publish to . ONRR will consider the following factors and conditions in specifying market centers:

        § 1206.115   What are my reporting requirements under an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.115

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents.

        (c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        § 1206.116   What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.116

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b)(1) For new non-arm's-length transportation facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable transportation costs for the applicable period.

        (2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the transportation system as your estimate, if available. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems.

        (3) Section 1206.118 applies when you amend your report based on the actual costs.

        (c) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. You may find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        (d) If you are authorized under § 1206.112(j) to use an exception to the requirement to calculate your actual transportation costs, you must follow the reporting requirements of § 1206.115.

        § 1206.117   What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a transportation allowance?

#### § § 1206.117

        (a) If you deduct a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil transported, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter, on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken to the date when you pay the additional royalties due.

        (b) If you improperly net a transportation allowance against the oil instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.

        § 1206.118   What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?

#### § § 1206.118

        (a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.

        (b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit plus interest.

        § 1206.119   How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?

#### § § 1206.119

        (a) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves for onshore leases and OCS leases, respectively.

        (b) If you base the value of oil determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.

        (c) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that you sustain before the royalty settlement metering or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or BSEE, whichever is appropriate, determines that such loss was unavoidable.

        (d) You must pay royalties on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of royalty settlement. You may not claim a reduction in that measured volume for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place either before or after the approved point of royalty settlement.

      Subpart D—Federal Gas

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 62030, Oct. 1, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1206.140   What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?

#### § § 1206.140

        (a) This subpart applies to all gas produced from Federal oil and gas leases onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It explains how you, as a lessee, must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.

        (b) The terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to the lessee.

        (c) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a(an): Federal statute; settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation; written agreement between the lessee and ONRR's Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects would at least approximate the value established under this subpart; express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

        (d) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty payments.

        § 1206.141   How do I calculate royalty value for unprocessed gas that I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length or non-arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.141

        (a) This section applies to unprocessed gas. Unprocessed gas is:

        (1) Gas that is not processed;

        (2) Any gas that you are not required to value under § 1206.142 or that ONRR does not value under § 1206.144; or

        (3) Any gas that you sell prior to processing based on a price per MMBtu or Mcf when the price is not based on the residue gas and gas plant products.

        (b) The value of gas under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the first arm's-length contract less a transportation allowance determined under § 1206.152. This value does not apply if you exercise the option in paragraph (c) of this section or if ONRR decides to value your gas under § 1206.144. You must use this paragraph (b) to value gas when:

        (1) You sell under an arm's-length contract;

        (2) You sell or transfer unprocessed gas to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or an affiliate of either of them, then sells the gas under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c) of this section;

        (3) You, your affiliate, or another person sell(s) unprocessed gas produced from a lease under multiple arm's-length contracts, and that gas is valued under this paragraph. Unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the value of the gas is the volume-weighted average of the values, established under this paragraph, for each contract for the sale of gas produced from that lease; or

        (4) You or your affiliate sell(s) under a pipeline cash-out program. In that case, for over-delivered volumes within the tolerance under a pipeline cash-out program, the value is the price that the pipeline must pay you or your affiliate under the transportation contract. You must use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances, even if those volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract.

        (c) If you do not sell under an arm's-length contract, you may elect to value your gas under this paragraph (c). You may not change your election more often than once every two years.

        (1)(i) If you can only transport gas to one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication, available at , your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for that index pricing point for the production month.

        (ii) If you can transport gas to more than one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at , your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for the index pricing points to which your gas could be transported for the production month, whether or not there are constraints for that production month.

        (iii) If there are sequential index pricing points on a pipeline, you must use the first index pricing point at or after your gas enters the pipeline.

        (iv) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section by 5 percent for sales from the OCS Gulf of Mexico and by 10 percent for sales from all other areas, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu.

        (v) After you select an ONRR-approved publication available at , you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years.

        (vi) ONRR may exclude an individual index pricing point found in an ONRR-approved publication if ONRR determines that the index pricing point does not accurately reflect the values of production. ONRR will publish a list of excluded index pricing points available at .

        (2) You may not take any other deductions from the value calculated under this paragraph (c).

        (d) If some of your gas is used, lost, unaccounted for, or retained as a fee under the terms of a sales or service agreement, that gas will be valued for royalty purposes using the same royalty valuation method for valuing the rest of the gas that you do sell.

        (e) If you have no written contract for the sale of gas or no sale of gas subject to this section and:

        (1) There is an index pricing point for the gas, then you must value your gas under paragraph (c) of this section; or

        (2) There is not an index pricing point for the gas, then ONRR will decide the value under § 1206.144.

        (i) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the value using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).

        (ii) You may use that method to determine value, for royalty purposes, until ONRR issues our decision.

        (iii) After ONRR issues our determination, you must make the adjustments under § 1206.143(a)(2).

        § 1206.142   How do I calculate royalty value for processed gas that I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length or non-arm's-length contract?

#### § § 1206.142

        (a) This section applies to the valuation of processed gas, including but not limited to:

        (1) Gas that you or your affiliate do not sell, or otherwise dispose of, under an arm's-length contract prior to processing.

        (2) Gas where your or your affiliate's arm's-length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for payment to be determined on the basis of the value of any products resulting from processing, including residue gas or natural gas liquids.

        (3) Gas that you or your affiliate process under an arm's-length keepwhole contract.

        (4) Gas where your or your affiliate's arm's-length contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas, and you or your affiliate exercise(s) that right.

        (b) The value of gas subject to this section, for royalty purposes, is the combined value of the residue gas and all gas plant products that you determine under this section plus the value of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing that you determine under subpart C of this part less applicable transportation and processing allowances that you determine under this subpart, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the first arm's-length contract. This value does not apply if you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or if ONRR decides to value your residue gas or any gas plant product under § 1206.144. You must use this paragraph (c) to value residue gas or any gas plant product when:

        (1) You sell under an arm's-length contract;

        (2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract, and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the residue gas or any gas plant product under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section;

        (3) You, your affiliate, or another person sell(s), under multiple arm's-length contracts, residue gas or any gas plant products recovered from gas produced from a lease that you value under this paragraph. In that case, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section, because you sold non-arm's-length to your affiliate or another person, the value of the residue gas or any gas plant product is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds established under this paragraph for each arm's-length contract for the sale of residue gas or any gas plant products recovered from gas produced from that lease; or

        (4) You or your affiliate sell(s) under a pipeline cash-out program. In that case, for over-delivered volumes within the tolerance under a pipeline cash-out program, the value is the price that the pipeline must pay to you or your affiliate under the transportation contract. You must use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances, even if those volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract.

        (d) If you do not sell under an arm's-length contract, you may elect to value your residue gas and NGLs under this paragraph (d). You may not change your election more often than once every two years.

        (1)(i) If you can only transport residue gas to one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at , your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for that index pricing point for the production month.

        (ii) If you can transport residue gas to more than one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at , your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for the index pricing points to which your gas could be transported for the production month, whether or not there are constraints, for the production month.

        (iii) If there are sequential index pricing points on a pipeline, you must use the first index pricing point at or after your residue gas enters the pipeline.

        (iv) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section by 5 percent for sales from the OCS Gulf of Mexico and by 10 percent for sales from all other areas, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu.

        (v) After you select an ONRR-approved publication available at , you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years.

        (vi) ONRR may exclude an individual index pricing point found in an ONRR-approved publication if ONRR determines that the index pricing point does not accurately reflect the values of production. ONRR will publish a list of excluded index pricing points on .

        (2)(i) If you sell NGLs in an area with one or more ONRR-approved commercial price bulletins available at , you must choose one bulletin, and your value, for royalty purposes, is the monthly average price for that bulletin for the production month.

        (ii) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the amounts that ONRR posts at  for the geographic location of your lease. The methodology that ONRR will use to calculate the amounts is set forth in the preamble to this regulation. This methodology is binding on you and ONRR. ONRR will update the amounts periodically using this methodology.

        (iii) After you select an ONRR-approved commercial price bulletin available at , you may not select a different commercial price bulletin more often than once every two years.

        (3) You may not take any other deductions from the value calculated under this paragraph (d).

        (4) ONRR will post changes to any of the rates in this paragraph (d) on its website.

        (e) If some of your gas or gas plant products are used, lost, unaccounted for, or retained as a fee under the terms of a sales or service agreement, that gas will be valued for royalty purposes using the same royalty valuation method for valuing the rest of the gas or gas plant products that you do sell.

        (f) If you have no written contract for the sale of gas or no sale of gas subject to this section and:

        (1) There is an index pricing point or commercial price bulletin for the gas, then you must value your gas under paragraph (d) of this section.

        (2) There is not an index pricing point or commercial price bulletin for the gas, then ONRR will determine the value under § 1206.144.

        (i) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the value using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).

        (ii) You may use that method to determine value, for royalty purposes, until ONRR issues our decision.

        (iii) After ONRR issues our determination, you must make the adjustments under § 1206.143(a)(2).

        § 1206.143   How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?

#### § § 1206.143

        (a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report. If ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR will direct you to use a different measure of royalty value or decide your value under § 1206.144.

        (2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must either pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter, or report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties.

        (b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144.

        (c) ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144 if ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under a contract do not reflect reasonable consideration because:

        (1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;

        (2) You have breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by selling your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a value that is unreasonably low. ONRR may consider a sales price unreasonably low if it is 10 percent less than the lowest reasonable measures of market price, including, but not limited to, index prices and prices reported to ONRR for like-quality gas, residue gas, or gas plant products; or

        (3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly valued your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products under § 1206.141 or § 1206.142 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.

        (d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

        (e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include(s) all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.

        (f)(1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.

        (2) If you or your affiliate make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract, but the purchaser refuses, and you or your affiliate take reasonable, documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part, or in a timely manner, for a quantity of gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.

        (g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.

        (2) If you or your affiliate fail(s) to comply with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144.

        (3) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 to the contrary.

        § 1206.144   How will ONRR determine the value of my gas for royalty purposes?

#### § § 1206.144

        If ONRR decides to value your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for royalty purposes under § 1206.143, or any other provision in this subpart, then ONRR will determine the value, for royalty purposes, by considering any information that we deem relevant, which may include, but is not limited to:

        (a) The value of like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields or areas.

        (b) The value of like-quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same plant or area.

        (c) Public sources of price or market information that ONRR deems to be reliable.

        (d) Information available or reported to ONRR, including, but not limited to, on form ONRR-2014 and form ONRR-4054.

        (e) Costs of transportation or processing if ONRR determines that they are applicable.

        (f) Any information that ONRR deems relevant regarding the particular lease operation or the salability of the gas.

        § 1206.145   What records must I keep in order to support my calculations of royalty under this subpart?

#### § § 1206.145

        If you value your gas under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of the royalty that you paid. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        (a) You must show:

        (1) How you calculated the royalty value, including all allowable deductions; and

        (2) How you complied with this subpart.

        (b) Upon request, you must submit all data to ONRR. You must comply with any such requirement within the time that ONRR specifies.

        § 1206.146   What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?

#### § § 1206.146

        (a) You must place gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition and market the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal government.

        (b) If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract to determine royalty, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that you normally are responsible to perform in order to place the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition or to market the gas.

        § 1206.147   When is an ONRR audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process considered final?

#### § § 1206.147

        Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, ONRR does not consider any audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in ONRR re-determining royalty due, under this subpart, final or binding as against the Federal government or its beneficiaries unless ONRR chooses to, in writing, formally close the audit period.

        § 1206.148   How do I request a valuation determination?

#### § § 1206.148

        (a) You may request a valuation determination from ONRR regarding any gas produced. Your request must:

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Identify specifically all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases;

        (3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request;

        (4) Include copies of all relevant documents;

        (5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and

        (6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.

        (b) In response to your request, ONRR may:

        (1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget issue a determination;

        (2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance; or

        (3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations; or

        (ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals.

        (c)(1) A determination that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.

        (2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination, and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (3) A determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

        (d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, delegated States, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.

        (1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or to request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under part 1290 of this title.

        (2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under part 1290 of this title.

        (e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or to make a determination.

        (f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR based any guidance, or the Assistant Secretary based any determination, takes precedence over the determination or guidance after the effective date of the statute or regulation, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the guidance or determination.

        (g) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.149.

        § 1206.149   Does ONRR protect information that I provide?

#### § § 1206.149

        (a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding royalties on gas, including deductions and allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.

        (b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.

        (c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.

        § 1206.150   How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?

#### § § 1206.150

        (a)(1) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of unprocessed gas as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves for onshore leases and OCS leases, respectively.

        (2) If you base the value of gas determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.

        (b)(1) For residue gas and gas plant products, the quantity basis for computing royalties due is the monthly net output of the plant, even though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary storage.

        (2) If you value residue gas and/or gas plant products determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality of residue gas and/or gas plant products that is different from that which is attributable to a lease determined under paragraph (c) of this section, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.

        (c) You must determine the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products attributable to a lease based on the following procedure:

        (1) When you derive the net output of the processing plant from gas obtained from only one lease, you must base the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products for royalty computation on the net output of the plant.

        (2) When you derive the net output of a processing plant from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, you must base the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease on the same proportions as the ratios obtained by dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the total amount of gas delivered from all leases.

        (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of non-uniform content:

        (i) You must determine the quantity of the residue gas allocable to each lease by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the residue gas content of the gas, and dividing that arithmetical product by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of the residue gas by the arithmetic quotient obtained.

        (ii) You must determine the net output of gas plant products allocable to each lease by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant product content of the gas, dividing that arithmetical product by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the arithmetic quotient obtained.

        (4) You may request prior ONRR approval of other methods for determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease. If approved, you must apply that method to all gas production from Federal leases that is processed in the same plant. You must do so beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your request to use another method.

        (d)(1) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas that you sustain before the royalty settlement meter or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or BSEE, whichever is appropriate, determines that such loss was unavoidable.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and § 1202.151(c), you must pay royalties due on 100 percent of the volume determined under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. You may not reduce that determined volume for actual losses after you have determined the quantity basis, or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products, as provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. You may not take any deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products to compensate for actual losses after you have determined the quantity basis or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place.

        § 1206.151   [Reserved]

#### § § 1206.151

        § 1206.152   What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?

#### § § 1206.152

        (a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.153 or § 1206.154, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs that you incur when moving a particular volume of production to reduce royalties that you owe on production for which you did not incur those costs. This paragraph applies when:

        (1) You value unprocessed gas under § 1206.141(b) or residue gas and gas plant products under § 1206.142(b) based on a sale at a point off of the lease, unit, or communitized area where the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas is produced; and

        (2)(i) The movement to the sales point is not gathering.

        (ii) For gas produced on the OCS, the movement of gas from the wellhead to the first platform is not transportation.

        (b) You must calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. If your or your affiliate's transportation contract includes more than one product in a gaseous phase, you must allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the products transported. Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products with no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products with no value).

        (1) You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

        (2) You may propose to ONRR a prospective cost allocation method based on the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method if it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.

        (3) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your proposed procedure until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (c)(1) Where you or your affiliate transport(s) both gaseous and liquid products through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.

        (2) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (3) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available data, within three months after you first claim the allocated deductions on form ONRR-2014.

        (d) If you value unprocessed gas under § 1206.141(c) or residue gas and gas plant products under § 1206.142 (d), you may not take a transportation allowance.

        (e)(1) Your transportation allowance may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas as determined under § 1206.141 or § 1206.142 of this subpart.

        (2) If ONRR approved your request to take a transportation allowance in excess of the 50-percent limitation under former § 1206.156(c)(3), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.

        (f) You must express transportation allowances for residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas as a dollar-value equivalent. If your or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration that you or your affiliate are/is paid to a dollar-value equivalent.

        (g) ONRR may determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.144 because:

        (1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;

        (2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the transportation because you breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by transporting your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a transportation allowance unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of transportation costs, including, but not limited to, transportation allowances reported to ONRR and tariffs for gas, residue gas, or gas plant products transported through the same system; or

        (3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a transportation allowance under § 1206.153 or § 1206.154 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.

        (h) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance.

        § 1206.153   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.153

        (a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 1206.152(g) and subject to the limitation in § 1206.152(e).

        (2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

        (b) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, you may include, but are not limited to, the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section; you may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section:

        (1)  You may deduct firm demand charges or capacity reservation fees that you or your affiliate paid to a pipeline, including charges or fees for unused firm capacity that you or your affiliate have not sold before you report your allowance. If you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment from any party for release or sale of firm capacity after reporting a transportation allowance that included the cost of that unused firm capacity, or if you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on form ONRR-2014 by the amount of that payment. You must modify form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period and pay any resulting royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (2)  The GSR costs result from a pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers in order to implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 284.

        (3)  The commodity charge allows the pipeline to recover the costs of providing service.

        (4)  Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines.

        (5)  The GRI conducts research, development, and commercialization programs on natural gas-related topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI fees are allowable, provided that such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved tariffs.

        (6)  FERC charges these fees to pipelines to pay for its operating expenses.

        (7)  Theoretical losses are not deductible in transportation arrangements unless the transportation allowance is based on arm's-length transportation rates charged under a FERC or State regulatory-approved tariff. If you or your affiliate receive(s) volumes or credit for line gain, you must reduce your transportation allowance accordingly and pay any resulting royalties plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter;

        (8)  This includes short-duration storage services that market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as “parking” or “banking”) offer or other temporary storage services that pipeline transporters provide, whether actual or provided as a matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or fewer.

        (9)  ONRR allows these costs only if such services are required for transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production into marketable condition required under § 1206.146 of this part.

        (10)  You may deduct the costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you or your affiliate, as a shipper, to maintain under a transportation contract.

        (11)  You may deduct hurricane surcharges that you or your affiliate actually pay(s).

        (c) You may not include the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1)  This includes storing production in a storage facility, whether on or off of the lease, for more than 30 days.

        (2)  This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to another person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including purchasing and reselling the gas or finding or maintaining a market for the gas production.

        (3)  These penalties include, but are not limited to:

        (i)  This includes the difference between the price that the pipeline pays to you or your affiliate for over-delivered volumes outside of the tolerances and the price that you or your affiliate receive(s) for over-delivered volumes within the tolerances.

        (ii)  This includes penalties that you or your affiliate incur(s) for differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.

        (iii)  This includes penalties that you or your affiliate incur(s) (generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.

        (iv)  This includes fees that you or your affiliate incur(s) for violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to protect the operational integrity of the pipeline.

        (4)  These are fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to hub operators for administrative services (such as title transfer tracking) necessary to account for the sale of gas within a hub.

        (5)  This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to parties who arrange marketing or transportation, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees.

        (6)  This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to parties who provide scheduling services, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees.

        (7)  This includes salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for the sale or movement of production.

        (8)  Any cost you or your affiliate incur(s) for services that you are required to provide at no cost to the lessor, including, but not limited to, costs to place your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products into marketable condition disallowed under § 1206.146 and costs of boosting residue gas disallowed under § 1202.151(b).

        (d) If you have no written contract for the transportation of gas, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.144. You may not use this paragraph (d) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.

        (1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).

        (2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues its determination.

        § 1206.154   How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have a non-arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.154

        (a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do(es) not have an arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or your affiliate provide your own transportation services. You must calculate your transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the procedures prescribed in this section.

        (b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs may include:

        (1) Capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.

        (2) Overhead under paragraph (h) of this section.

        (3) Depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or you may elect to use a cost equal to a return on the initial depreciable capital investment in the transportation system under paragraph (i)(2) of this section. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (4) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section, after you have depreciated the transportation system to its reasonable salvage value.

        (c)(1) To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, if you or your affiliate incur(s) the actual transportation costs listed under § 1206.153(b)(2), (5), and (6) of this subpart under your or your affiliate's non-arm's-length contract, you may include those costs in your calculations under this section. You may not include any of the other costs identified under § 1206.153(b).

        (2) You may not include in your calculations under this section any of the non-allowable costs listed under § 1206.153(c).

        (d) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.

        (e) Allowable capital investment costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (f) Allowable operating expenses include the following:

        (g) Allowable maintenance expenses include the following:

        (h) Overhead, directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system, is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (i)(1) To calculate depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the transportation system services, or you may elect to use a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (i) A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/lessee established for the purposes of the allowance calculation.

        (ii) You may depreciate a transportation system only once with or without a change in ownership.

        (iii)(A) To calculate the return on undepreciated capital investment, you may use an amount equal to the undepreciated capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return that you determine under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (B) After you have depreciated a transportation system to the reasonable salvage value, you may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to the reasonable salvage value multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

        (2) As an alternative to using depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, you may use as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. You may not include depreciation in your allowance.

        (3) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating.

        (i) You must use the monthly average BBB rate that Standard & Poor's publishes for the first month for which the allowance is applicable.

        (ii) You must re-determine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        § 1206.155   What are my reporting requirements under an arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.155

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents.

        (c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        § 1206.156   What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length transportation contract?

#### § § 1206.156

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on non-arm's-length transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b)(1) For new non-arm's-length transportation facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable transportation costs for the applicable period.

        (2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the transportation system as your estimate. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems.

        (3) Section 1206.158 applies when you amend your report based on your actual costs.

        (c) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        § 1206.157   What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a transportation allowance?

#### § § 1206.157

        (a)(1) If ONRR determines that you took an unauthorized transportation allowance, then you must pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (2) If you understated your transportation allowance, you may be entitled to a credit, with interest.

        (b) If you deduct a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products transported, you must pay late payment interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken until the date when you pay the additional royalties due.

        (c) If you improperly net a transportation allowance against the sales value of the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.

        § 1206.158   What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?

#### § § 1206.158

        (a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.

        (b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit, plus interest.

        § 1206.159   What general processing allowances requirements apply to me?

#### § § 1206.159

        (a)(1) When you value any gas plant product under § 1206.142(c) of this subpart, you may deduct from the value the reasonable, actual costs of processing.

        (2) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a processing allowance.

        (b) You must allocate processing costs among the gas plant products. You must determine a separate processing allowance for each gas plant product and processing plant relationship. ONRR considers NGLs to be one product.

        (c)(1) You may not apply the processing allowance against the value of the residue gas.

        (2) The processing allowance deduction on the basis of an individual product may not exceed 66  percent of the value of each gas plant product determined under § 1206.142(c). Before you calculate the 66 -percent limit, you must first reduce the value for any transportation allowances related to post-processing transportation authorized under § 1206.152.

        (3) If ONRR approved your request to take a processing allowance in excess of the limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section under former § 1206.158(c)(3), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.

        (4) If ONRR approved your request to take an extraordinary cost processing allowance under former § 1206.158(d), ONRR terminates that approval as of January 1, 2017.

        (d)(1) ONRR will not allow a processing cost deduction for the costs of placing lease products in marketable condition, including dehydration, separation, compression, or storage, even if those functions are performed off the lease or at a processing plant.

        (2) Where gas is processed for the removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as “sweetening,” ONRR will not allow processing cost deductions for such costs unless the acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product.

        (A) In such event, you are eligible for a processing allowance determined under this subpart.

        (B) ONRR will not grant any processing allowance for processing lease production that is not royalty bearing.

        (e) ONRR may determine your processing allowance under § 1206.144 because:

        (1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;

        (2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length processing contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the processing because you breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by processing your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a processing allowance unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of processing costs, including, but not limited to, processing allowances reported to ONRR; or

        (3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a processing allowance under § 1206.160 or § 1206.161 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.

        § 1206.160   How do I determine a processing allowance if I have an arm's-length processing contract?

#### § § 1206.160

        (a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur processing costs under an arm's-length processing contract, you may claim a processing allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section and subject to the limitation in § 1206.159(c)(2).

        (2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

        (b)(1) If your or your affiliate's arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product, and you can determine the processing costs for each product based on the contract, then you must determine the processing costs for each gas plant product under the contract.

        (2) If your or your affiliate's arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product, and you cannot determine the processing costs attributable to each product from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR.

        (i) You may use your proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination.

        (ii) You must submit all relevant data to support your proposal.

        (iii) ONRR will determine the processing allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.

        (iv) You must submit the allocation proposal within three months of claiming the allocated deduction on form ONRR-2014.

        (3) You may not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

        (4) If your or your affiliate's payments for processing under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration that you or your affiliate paid to a dollar-value equivalent.

        (c) If you have no written contract for the arm's-length processing of gas, then ONRR will determine your processing allowance under § 1206.144. You may not use this paragraph (c) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own processing.

        (1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).

        (2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues a determination.

        § 1206.161   How do I determine a processing allowance if I have a non-arm's-length processing contract?

#### § § 1206.161

        (a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do(es) not have an arm's-length processing contract, including situations where you or your affiliate provide your own processing services. You must calculate your processing allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, actual costs for processing during the reporting period using the procedures prescribed in this section.

        (b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs may include:

        (1) Capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.

        (2) Overhead under paragraph (g) of this section.

        (3) Depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section, or you may elect to use a cost equal to the initial depreciable capital investment in the processing plant under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. After you have elected to use either method for a processing plant, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (4) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, after you have depreciated the processing plant to its reasonable salvage value.

        (c) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.

        (d) Allowable capital investment costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment), which are an integral part of the processing plant.

        (e) Allowable operating expenses include the following:

        (1) Operations supervision and engineering

        (2) Operations labor

        (3) Fuel

        (4) Utilities

        (5) Materials

        (6) Ad valorem property taxes

        (7) Rent

        (8) Supplies

        (9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that you can document

        (f) Allowable maintenance expenses may include the following:

        (1) Maintenance of the processing plant

        (2) Maintenance of equipment

        (3) Maintenance labor

        (4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document

        (g) Overhead, directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the processing plant, is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (h)(1) To calculate depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the processing plant services, or you may elect to use a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.

        (i) A change in ownership of a processing plant will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original processor/lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation.

        (ii) You may depreciate a processing plant only once with or without a change in ownership.

        (iii)(A) To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may use an amount equal to the undepreciated capital investment in the processing plant multiplied by the rate of return that you determine under paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

        (B) After you have depreciated a processing plant to its reasonable salvage value, you may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to the reasonable salvage value multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

        (2) You may use as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the processing plant multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (h)(3) of this section. You may not include depreciation in your allowance.

        (3) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating.

        (i) You must use the monthly average BBB rate that Standard & Poor's publishes for the first month for which the allowance is applicable.

        (ii) You must re-determine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        (i)(1) You must determine the processing allowance for each gas plant product based on your or your affiliate's reasonable and actual cost of processing the gas. You must base your allocation of costs to each gas plant product upon generally accepted accounting principles.

        (2) You may not take an allowance for processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

        (j) You may apply for an exception from the requirement to calculate actual costs under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

        (1) ONRR will grant the exception if:

        (i) You have or your affiliate has arm's-length contracts for processing other gas production at the same processing plant; and

        (ii) At least 50 percent of the gas processed annually at the plant is processed under arm's-length processing contracts.

        (2) If ONRR grants the exception, you must use as your processing allowance the volume-weighted average prices charged to other persons under arm's-length contracts for processing at the same plant.

        § 1206.162   What are my reporting requirements under an arm's-length processing contract?

#### § § 1206.162

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on arm's-length processing costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit arm's-length processing contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents.

        (c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        § 1206.163   What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length processing contract?

#### § § 1206.163

        (a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on non-arm's-length processing costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

        (b)(1) For new non-arm's-length processing facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable gas processing costs for the applicable period.

        (2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the processing plant as your estimate, if available. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar processing plants.

        (3) Section 1206.165 applies when you amend your report based on your actual costs.

        (c) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

        (d) If you are authorized under § 1206.161(j) to use an exception to the requirement to calculate your actual processing costs, you must follow the reporting requirements of § 1206.162.

        § 1206.164   What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a processing allowance?

#### § § 1206.164

        (a)(1) If ONRR determines that you took an unauthorized processing allowance, then you must pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.

        (2) If you understated your processing allowance, you may be entitled to a credit, with interest.

        (b) If you deduct a processing allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 66  percent of the value of a gas plant product, you must pay late payment interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken until the date when you pay the additional royalties due.

        (c) If you improperly net a processing allowance against the sales value of a gas plant product instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.

        § 1206.165   What reporting adjustments must I make for processing allowances?

#### § § 1206.165

        (a) If your actual processing allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.

        (b) If the actual processing allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit, plus interest.

        Transportation Allowances

          § 1206.177   What general requirements regarding transportation allowances apply to me?

#### § § 1206.177

          (a) When you value gas under § 1206.174 at a point off the lease, unit, or communitized area (for example, sales point or point of value determination), you may deduct from value a transportation allowance to reflect the value, for royalty purposes, at the lease, unit, or communitized area. The allowance is based on the reasonable actual costs you incurred to transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products from a lease to a point off the lease, unit, or communitized area. This would include, if appropriate, transportation from the lease to a gas processing plant off the lease, unit, or communitized area and from the plant to a point away from the plant. You may not deduct any allowance for gathering costs.

          (b) You must allocate transportation costs among all products you produce and transport as provided in § 1206.178.

          (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, your transportation allowance deduction for each sales type code may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant product. For purposes of this section, natural gas liquids are considered one product.

          (2) If you ask ONRR, ONRR may approve a transportation allowance deduction in excess of the limitations in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. To receive this approval, you must demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitations in paragraph (c)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. Under no circumstances may an allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes under any sales type code to zero.

          (3) Your application for exception (using Form ONRR-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) must contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for ONRR to make a determination.

          (d) If ONRR conducts a review or audit and determines that you have improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this subpart, then you will be required to pay any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance with § 1218.54 of this chapter. Alternatively, you may be entitled to a credit, but you will not receive any interest on your overpayment.

> [64 FR 43515, Aug. 10, 1999, as amended at 73 FR 15891, Mar. 26, 2008]

          § 1206.178   How do I determine a transportation allowance?

#### § § 1206.178

          (a)  (1) This paragraph explains how to determine your allowance if you have an arm's-length transportation contract.

          (i) If you have an arm's-length contract for transportation of your production, the transportation allowance is the reasonable, actual costs you incur for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or gas plant products under that contract. Paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section provide a limited exception. You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length. Your allowances also are subject to paragraph (e) of this section. You are required to submit to ONRR a copy of your arm's-length transportation contract(s) and all subsequent amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date ONRR receives your report which claims the allowance on the Form ONRR-2014.

          (ii) When either ONRR or a tribe conducts reviews and audits, they will examine whether or not the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from you to the transporter of the transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, then ONRR may require that the transportation allowance be determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

          (iii) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, then ONRR will require that the transportation allowance be determined under paragraph (b) of this section. In these circumstances, ONRR will notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your transportation costs.

          (2) This paragraph explains how to allocate the costs to each product if your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract.

          (i) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total transportation costs must be allocated in a consistent and equitable manner to each of the products transported. To make this allocation, use the same proportion as the ratio that the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) bears to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, you cannot take an allowance for the costs of transporting lease production that is not royalty bearing without ONRR approval, or without lessor approval on tribal leases.

          (ii) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method based on the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method if we determine that it meets one of the two following requirements:

          (A) The methodology in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section cannot be applied; and

          (B) Your proposal is more reasonable than the methodology in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

          (3) This paragraph explains how to allocate costs to each product if your arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each cannot be determined from the contract.

          (i) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR. You may use the transportation allowance determined in accordance with your proposed allocation procedure until ONRR decides whether to accept your cost allocation.

          (ii) You are required to submit all relevant data to support your allocation proposal. ONRR will then determine the gas transportation allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary.

          (4) If your payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar per unit price, you must convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

          (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price includes a reduction for a transportation factor, ONRR will not consider the transportation factor to be a transportation allowance. You may use the transportation factor to determine your gross proceeds for the sale of the product. However, the transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without ONRR approval.

          (b)  (1) This paragraph explains how to determine your allowance if you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no contract.

          (i) When you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no contract, including those situations where you perform transportation services for yourself, the transportation allowance is based upon your reasonable, allowable, actual costs for transportation as provided in this paragraph.

          (ii) All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. You must submit the actual cost information to support the allowance to ONRR on Form ONRR-4295, Gas Transportation Allowance Report, within 3 months after the end of the 12-month period to which the allowance applies. However, ONRR may approve a longer time period. ONRR will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may require you to modify your actual transportation allowance deduction.

          (2) This paragraph explains what actual transportation costs are allowable under a non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation. The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations is based upon your actual costs for transportation during the reporting period. Allowable costs include operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment (in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section), or a cost equal to the initial depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.

          (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that you can document.

          (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the transportation system, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.

          (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

          (iv) You may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment or a return on depreciable capital investment. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.

          (A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the transportation system services, or a unit of production method. Once you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system may be depreciated only once. Equipment may not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value. To compute a return on undepreciated capital investment, you will multiply the undepreciated capital investment in the transportation system by the rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

          (B) To compute a return on depreciable capital investment, you will multiply the initial capital investment in the transportation system by the rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance will be provided for depreciation. This alternative will apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service after March 1, 1988.

          (v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return is the monthly average rate as published in  for the first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and is effective during the reporting period. The rate must be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period that is determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

          (3) This paragraph explains how to allocate transportation costs to each product and transportation system.

          (i) The deduction for transportation costs must be determined based on your cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. If you transport more than one product in a gaseous phase, the allocation of costs to each of the products transported must be made in a consistent and equitable manner. The allocation should be in the same proportion that the volume of each product (excluding waste products that have no value) bears to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products that have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, you may not take an allowance for transporting a product that is not royalty bearing without ONRR approval.

          (ii) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method based on the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method upon determining that it meets one of the two following requirements:

          (A) The methodology in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section cannot be applied; and

          (B) Your proposal is more reasonable than the method in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

          (4) Your transportation allowance under this paragraph (b) must be determined based upon a calendar year or other period if you and ONRR agree to an alternative.

          (5) If you transport both gaseous and liquid products through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR. You may use the transportation allowance determined in accordance with your proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. You are required to submit all relevant data to support your proposal. ONRR will then determine the transportation allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary.

          (c)  (1) As an alternative to computing your transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section, you may use as the transportation allowance 10 percent of your gross proceeds but not to exceed 30 cents per MMBtu.

          (2) Your election to use the alternative transportation allowance calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be made at the beginning of a month and must remain in effect for an entire calendar year. Your first election will remain in effect until the end of the succeeding calendar year, except for elections effective January 1 that will be effective only for that calendar year.

          (d)  (1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. The data must be provided within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.

          (2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allottee leases, and with lessor approval on tribal leases.

          (e)  If for any month the transportation allowance you are entitled to is less than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014, you are required to report and pay additional royalties due, plus interest computed under § 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month you deducted the improper transportation allowance until the date you pay the royalties due. If the transportation allowance you are entitled to is greater than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014 for any royalties during the reporting period, you are entitled to a credit. No interest will be paid on the overpayment.

          (f)  Lessees may include, but are not limited to, the following costs in determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section:

          (1)  You must limit the allowable costs for the firm demand charges to the applicable rate per MMBtu multiplied by the actual volumes transported. You may not include any losses incurred for previously purchased but unused firm capacity. You also may not include any gains associated with releasing firm capacity. If you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on the Form ONRR-2014. You must modify the Form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period.

          (2)  The GSR costs result from a pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to implement the restructuring requirements of FERC orders in 18 CFR part 284.

          (3)  The commodity charge allows the pipeline to recover the costs of providing service.

          (4)  Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines.

          (5)  The GRI conducts research, development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved tariffs.

          (6)  FERC charges these fees to pipelines to pay for its operating expenses.

          (7)  This paragraph does not apply to non-arm's-length transportation arrangements.

          (8)  This includes short duration storage services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as “parking” or “banking”), or other temporary storage services provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less.

          (9)  ONRR allows these costs only if such services are required for transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production into marketable condition required under § 1206.174(h).

          (g)  Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section:

          (1)  This includes storing production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more than 30 days.

          (2)  This includes fees you pay to another person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for the gas production.

          (3)  These penalties include, but are not limited to the following:

          (i)  This includes the difference between the price the pipeline pays you for over-delivered volumes outside the tolerances and the price you receive for over-delivered volumes within tolerances.

          (ii)  This includes penalties you incur for differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.

          (iii)  This includes penalties you incur (generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.

          (iv)  This includes fees you incur for violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to protect the operational integrity of the pipeline.

          (4)  These are fees you pay to hub operators for administrative services (e.g., title transfer tracking) necessary to account for the sale of gas within a hub.

          (5)  Any cost you incur for services you are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.

          (h)  You must follow the provisions of this section to determine transportation costs when establishing value using either a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that allows deduction of actual transportation costs.

        Processing Allowances

          § 1206.179   What general requirements regarding processing allowances apply to me?

#### § § 1206.179

          (a) When you value any gas plant product under § 1206.174, you may deduct from value the reasonable actual costs of processing.

          (b) You must allocate processing costs among the gas plant products. You must determine a separate processing allowance for each gas plant product and processing plant relationship. Natural gas liquids are considered as one product.

          (c) The processing allowance deduction based on an individual product may not exceed 66  percent of the value of each gas plant product determined under § 1206.174. Before you calculate the 66  percent limit, you must first reduce the value for any transportation allowances related to post-processing transportation authorized under § 1206.177.

          (d) Processing cost deductions will not be allowed for placing lease products in marketable condition. These costs include among others, dehydration, separation, compression upstream of the facility measurement point, or storage, even if those functions are performed off the lease or at a processing plant. Costs for the removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as sweetening, are not allowed unless the acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product. In such event, you will be eligible for a processing allowance determined under this subpart. However, ONRR will not grant any processing allowance for processing lease production that is not royalty bearing.

          (e) You will be allowed a reasonable amount of residue gas royalty free for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance will be made for expenses incidental to marketing, except as provided in 30 CFR part 1206. In those situations where a processing plant processes gas from more than one lease, only that proportionate share of your residue gas necessary for the operation of the processing plant will be allowed royalty free.

          (f) You do not owe royalty on residue gas, or any gas plant product resulting from processing gas, that is reinjected into a reservoir within the same lease, unit, or approved Federal agreement, until such time as those products are finally produced from the reservoir for sale or other disposition. This paragraph applies only when the reinjection is included in a BLM-approved plan of development or operations.

          (g) If ONRR determines that you have determined an improper processing allowance authorized by this subpart, then you will be required to pay any additional royalties plus late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 of this chapter. Alternatively, you may be entitled to a credit, but you will not receive any interest on your overpayment.

          § 1206.180   How do I determine an actual processing allowance?

#### § § 1206.180

          (a)  (1) This paragraph explains how you determine an allowance under an arm's-length processing contract.

          (i) The processing allowance is the reasonable actual costs you incur to process the gas under that contract. Paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section provide a limited exception. You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length. You are required to submit to ONRR a copy of your arm's-length contract(s) and all subsequent amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date ONRR receives your first report that deducts the allowance on the Form ONRR-2014.

          (ii) When ONRR conducts reviews and audits, we will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from you to the processor for the processing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, then ONRR may require that the processing allowance be determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

          (iii) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-length processing contract does not reflect the value of the processing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, then ONRR will require that the processing allowance be determined under paragraph (b) of this section. In these circumstances, ONRR will notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your processing costs.

          (2) If your arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product can be determined from the contract, then the processing costs for each gas plant product must be determined in accordance with the contract. You may not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

          (3) If your arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR. You may use your proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination. You are required to submit all relevant data to support your proposal. ONRR will then determine the processing allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. You may not take a processing allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

          (4) If your payments for processing under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar per unit price, you must convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

          (b)  (1) This paragraph applies if you have a non-arm's-length processing contract or no contract, including those situations where you perform processing for yourself.

          (i) If you have a non-arm's-length contract or no contract, the processing allowance is based upon your reasonable actual costs of processing as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

          (ii) All processing allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. You must submit the actual cost information to support the allowance to ONRR on Form ONRR-4109, Gas Processing Allowance Summary Report, within 3 months after the end of the 12-month period for which the allowance applies. ONRR may approve a longer time period. ONRR will monitor the allowance deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may require you to modify your processing allowance.

          (2) The processing allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations is based upon your actual costs for processing during the reporting period. Allowable costs include operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment (in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section), or a cost equal to the initial depreciable investment in the processing plant multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the processing plant.

          (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that the lessee can document.

          (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the processing plant, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.

          (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the processing plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

          (iv) You may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciable capital investment or a return on depreciable capital investment. After you elect to use either method for a processing plant, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.

          (A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the processing plant services, or a unit-of-production method. Once you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a processing plant will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original processor/lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation. However, for processing plants you or your affiliate purchase that do not have a previously claimed ONRR depreciation schedule, you may treat the processing plant as a newly installed facility for depreciation purposes. A processing plant may be depreciated only once, regardless of whether there is a change in ownership. Equipment may not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value. To compute a return on undepreciated capital investment, you must multiply the undepreciable capital investment in the processing plant by the rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

          (B) To compute a return on depreciable capital investment, you must multiply the initial capital investment in the processing plant by the rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance will be provided for depreciation. This alternative will apply only to plants first placed in service after March 1, 1988.

          (v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return is the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

          (3) Your processing allowance under this paragraph (b) must be determined based upon a calendar year or other period if you and ONRR agree to an alternative.

          (4) The processing allowance for each gas plant product must be determined based on your reasonable and actual cost of processing the gas. You must base your allocation of costs to each gas plant product upon generally accepted accounting principles. You may not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

          (c)  (1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your processing allowance. The data must be provided within a reasonable period of time, as ONRR determines.

          (2) You must report gas processing allowances as a separate entry on the Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure for allottee leases, and with lessor approval on tribal leases.

          (d)  If for any month the gas processing allowance you are entitled to is less than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014, you are required to pay additional royalties, plus interest computed under § 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month you deducted a processing allowance until the date you pay the royalties due. If the processing allowance you are entitled is greater than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014, you are entitled to a credit. However, no interest will be paid on the overpayment.

          (e)  You must follow the provisions of this section to determine processing costs when establishing value using either a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of actual processing costs.

          § 1206.181   How do I establish processing costs for dual accounting purposes when I do not process the gas?

#### § § 1206.181

          Where accounting for comparison (dual accounting) is required for gas production from a lease but neither you nor someone acting on your behalf processes the gas, and you have elected to perform actual dual accounting under § 1206.176, you must use the first applicable of the following methods to establish processing costs for dual accounting purposes:

          (a) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that some gas has previously been processed under these agreements.

          (b) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that the agreements are in effect for plants to which the lease is physically connected and under which gas from other leases in the field or area is being or has been processed.

          (c) A proposed comparable processing fee submitted to either the tribe and ONRR (for tribal leases) or ONRR (for allotted leases) with your supporting documentation submitted to ONRR. If ONRR does not take action on your proposal within 120 days, the proposal will be deemed to be denied and subject to appeal to the ONRR Director under 30 CFR part 1290.

          (d) Processing costs based on the regulations in §§ 1206.179 and 1206.180.

        § 1206.170   What does this subpart contain?

#### § § 1206.170

        This subpart contains royalty valuation provisions applicable to Indian lessees.

        (a) This subpart applies to all gas production from Indian (tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation). The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms. This subpart does not apply to Federal leases.

        (b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, treaty, negotiated agreement, settlement agreement resulting from any administrative or judicial proceeding, or Indian oil and gas lease are inconsistent with any regulation in this subpart, then the Federal statute, treaty, negotiated agreement, settlement agreement, or lease will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        (c) You may calculate the value of production for royalty purposes under methods other than those the regulations in this title require, but only if you, the tribal lessor, and ONRR jointly agree to the valuation methodology. For leases on Indian allotted lands, you and ONRR must agree to the valuation methodology.

        (d) All royalty payments you make to ONRR are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment.

        (e) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.

        § 1206.171   What definitions apply to this subpart?

#### § § 1206.171

        The following definitions apply to this subpart and to subpart J of part 1202 of this title:

        means the same as dual accounting.

        means a market where one or more ONRR-acceptable publications publish bidweek prices (or if bidweek prices are not available, first of the month prices) for at least one index-pricing point in the index zone.

        means a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual cost of transportation determined under this subpart.

        means a geographic region at least as large as the defined limits of an oil or gas field, in which oil or gas lease products have similar quality, economic, or legal characteristics. An area may be all lands within the boundaries of an Indian reservation.

        means a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. The following percentages (based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership) determine if persons are affiliated:

        (1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control.

        (2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control.

        (3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which ONRR may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. ONRR may require the lessee to certify the percentage of ownership or control of the entity. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as well as when the contract was executed.

        means a review, conducted under generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other persons who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.

        means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.

        means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.

        means raising the pressure of gas.

        means any condensate recovered downstream of the facility measurement point without resorting to processing. _Drip condensate_ includes condensate recovered as a result of its becoming a liquid during the transportation of the gas removed from the lease or recovered at the inlet of a gas processing plant by mechanical means, often referred to as scrubber condensate.

        (or ) refers to the requirement to pay royalty based on a value which is the higher of the value of gas prior to processing less any applicable allowances as compared to the combined value of drip condensate, residue gas, and gas plant products after processing, less applicable allowances.

        (or ) means the gas production from a lease, or allocable to lease acreage under the terms of an AFA, multiplied by the operating rights owner's percentage of interest ownership in the lease or the acreage.

        (or ) means the point where the BLM-approved measurement device is located for determining the volume of gas removed from the lease. The facility measurement point may be on the lease or off-lease with BLM approval.

        means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located.

        means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.

        means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas. However, it does not include residue gas.

        means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized area; or a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel.

        (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the disposition of unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products produced. _Gross proceeds_ includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as compression, dehydration, measurement, or field gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor, and payments for gas processing rights. Gross proceeds, as applied to gas, also includes but is not limited to reimbursements for severance taxes and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest is exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.

        means the calculated composite price ($/MMBtu) of spot-market sales published by a publication that meets ONRR-established criteria for acceptability at the index-pricing point.

        (IPP) means any point on a pipeline for which there is an index.

For purposes of this subpart, this definition excludes Federal leases.

        means any leased minerals attributable to, originating from, or allocated to a lease.

        means any person to whom the United States, a tribe, and/or individual Indian landowner issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease (including operating rights owners) as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment responsibility.

        means lease products which have similar chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.

        means a condition in which lease products are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise so conditioned that a purchaser will accept them under a sales contract typical for the field or area.

        means the same as facility measurement point.

        means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, desulphurization (or “sweetening”), and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.

        gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of methane resulting from processing gas.

        means the contract type or general disposition (e.g., arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation or processing allowance.

        means a contract wherein a seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of short duration. It also does not normally require a cancellation notice to terminate, and does not contain an obligation, or imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.

        means when the operating rights owner sells or removes production from, or allocated to, the lease, or when such sale or removal occurs for the benefit of an operating rights owner.

        means the same as net-back method.

        § 1206.172   How do I value gas produced from leases in an index zone?

#### § § 1206.172

        (a)  This section explains how lessees must value, for royalty purposes, gas produced from Indian leases located in an index zone. For other leases, value must be determined under § 1206.174.

        (1) You must use the valuation provision of this section if your lease is in an index zone and meets one of the following two requirements:

        (i) Has a major portion provision;

        (ii) Does not have a major portion provision, but provides for the Secretary to determine the value of production.

        (2) This section does not apply to carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other non-hydrocarbon components of the gas stream. However, if they are recovered and sold separately from the gas stream, you must determine the value of these products under § 1206.174.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (b) explains how you must value the following four types of gas:

        (i) Gas production before processing;

        (ii) Gas production that you certify on Form ONRR-4410, Certification for Not Performing Accounting for Comparison (Dual Accounting), is not processed before it flows into a pipeline with an index but which may be processed later;

        (iii) Residue gas after processing; and

        (iv) Gas that is never processed.

        (2) The value of gas production that is not sold under an arm's-length dedicated contract is the index-based value determined under paragraph (d) of this section unless the gas was subject to a previous contract which was part of a gas contract settlement. If the previous contract was subject to a gas contract settlement and if the royalty-bearing contract settlement proceeds per MMBtu added to the 80 percent of the safety net prices calculated at § 1206.172(e)(4)(i) exceeds the index-based value that applies to the gas under this section (including any adjustments required under § 1206.176), then the value of the gas is the higher of the value determined under this section (including any adjustments required under § 1206.176) or § 1206.174.

        (3) The value of gas production that is sold under an arm's-length dedicated contract is the higher of the index-based value under paragraph (d) of this section or the value of that production determined under § 1206.174(b).

        (c)  Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (c) explains how you must value gas that is processed before it flows into a pipeline with an index. You must value this gas production based on the higher of the following two values:

        (1) The value of the gas before processing determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) The value of the gas after processing, which is either the alternative dual accounting value under § 1206.173 or the sum of the following three values:

        (i) The value of the residue gas determined under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, as applicable;

        (ii) The value of the gas plant products determined under § 1206.174, less any applicable processing and/or transportation allowances determined under this subpart; and

        (iii) The value of any drip condensate associated with the processed gas determined under subpart B of this part.

        (d)  (1) To determine the index-based value per MMBtu for production from a lease in an index zone, you must use the following procedures:

        (i) For each ONRR-approved publication, calculate the average of the highest reported prices for all index-pricing points in the index zone, except for any prices excluded under paragraph (d)(6) of this section;

        (ii) Sum the averages calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and divide by the number of publications; and

        (iii) Reduce the number calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section by 10 percent, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu. The result is the index-based value per MMBtu for production from all leases in that index zone.

        (2) ONRR will publish in the  the index zones that are eligible for the index-based valuation method under this paragraph. ONRR will monitor the market activity in the index zones and, if necessary, hold a technical conference to add or modify a particular index zone. Any change to the index zones will be published in the  ONRR will consider the following five factors and conditions in determining eligible index zones:

        (i) Areas for which ONRR-approved publications establish index prices that accurately reflect the value of production in the field or area where the production occurs;

        (ii) Common markets served;

        (iii) Common pipeline systems;

        (iv) Simplification; and

        (v) Easy identification in ONRR's systems, such as counties or Indian reservations.

        (3) If market conditions change so that an index-based method for determining value is no longer appropriate for an index zone, ONRR will hold a technical conference to consider disqualification of an index zone. ONRR will publish notice in the  if an index zone is disqualified. If an index zone is disqualified, then production from leases in that index zone cannot be valued under this paragraph.

        (4) ONRR periodically will publish in the  a list of acceptable publications based on certain criteria, including, but not limited to the following five criteria:

        (i) Publications buyers and sellers frequently use;

        (ii) Publications frequently referenced in purchase or sales contracts;

        (iii) Publications that use adequate survey techniques, including the gathering of information from a substantial number of sales;

        (iv) Publications that publish the range of reported prices they use to calculate their index; and

        (v) Publications independent from DOI, lessors, and lessees.

        (5) Any publication may petition ONRR to be added to the list of acceptable publications.

        (6) ONRR may exclude an individual index price for an index zone in an ONRR-approved publication if ONRR determines that the index price does not accurately reflect the value of production in that index zone. ONRR will publish a list of excluded indices in the

        (7) ONRR will reference which tables in the publications you must use for determining the associated index prices.

        (8) The index-based values determined under this paragraph are not subject to deductions for transportation or processing allowances determined under §§ 1206.177, 1206.178, 1206.179, and 1206.180.

        (e)  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the value for royalty purposes of gas production from an Indian lease that is sold beyond the first index pricing point through which it flows cannot be less than the value determined under this paragraph (e).

        (2) By June 30 following any calendar year, you must calculate for each month of that calendar year your safety net price per MMBtu using the procedures in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. You must calculate a safety net price for each month and for each index zone where you have an Indian lease for which you report and pay royalties.

        (3) Your safety net price (S) for an index zone is the volume-weighted average contract price per delivered MMBtu under your or your affiliate's arm's-length contracts for the disposition of residue gas or unprocessed gas produced from your Indian leases in that index zone as computed under this paragraph (e)(3).

        (i) Include in your calculation only sales under those contracts that establish a delivery point beyond the first index pricing point through which the gas flows, and that include any gas produced from or allocable to one or more of your Indian leases in that index zone, even if the contract also includes gas produced from Federal, State, or fee properties. Include in your volume-weighted average calculation those volumes that are allocable to your Indian leases in that index zone.

        (ii) Do not reduce the contract price for any transportation costs incurred to deliver the gas to the purchaser.

        (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (e), the contract price will not include the following amounts:

        (A) Any amounts you receive in compromise or settlement of a predecessor contract for that gas;

        (B) Deductions for you or any other person to put gas production into marketable condition or to market the gas; and

        (C) Any amounts related to marketable securities associated with the sales contract.

        (4) Next, you must determine for each month the safety net differential (SND). You must perform this calculation separately for each index zone.

        (i) For each index zone, the safety net differential is equal to: SND = [(0.80 × S) − (1.25 × I)] where (I) is the index-based value determined under 30 CFR 206.172(d).

        (ii) If the safety net differential is positive you owe additional royalties.

        (5)(i) To calculate the additional royalties you owe, make the following calculation for each of your Indian leases in that index zone that produced gas that was sold beyond the first index-pricing point through which the gas flowed and that was used in the calculation in paragraph (e)(3) of this section:

        (ii) If gas produced from any of your Indian leases is commingled or pooled with gas produced from non-Indian properties, and if any of the combined gas is sold at a delivery point beyond the first index pricing point through which the gas flows, then the volume allocable to each Indian lease for which gas was sold beyond the first index pricing point in the calculation under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section is the volume produced from the lease multiplied by the proportion that the total volume of gas sold beyond the first index pricing point bears to the total volume of gas commingled or pooled from all properties.

        (iii) Add the numbers calculated for each lease under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section. The total is the additional royalty you owe.

        (6) You have the following responsibilities to comply with the minimum value for royalty purposes:

        (i) You must report the safety net price for each index zone to ONRR on Form ONRR-4411, Safety Net Report, no later than June 30 following each calendar year;

        (ii) You must pay and report on Form ONRR-2014 additional royalties due no later than June 30 following each calendar year; and

        (iii) ONRR may order you to amend your safety net price within one year from the date your Form ONRR-4411 is due or is filed, whichever is later. If ONRR does not order any amendments within that one-year period, your safety net price calculation is final.

        (f)  (1) An Indian tribe may ask ONRR to exclude some or all of its leases from valuation under this section. ONRR will consult with BIA regarding the request.

        (i) If ONRR approves the request for your lease, you must value your production under § 1206.174 beginning with production on the first day of the second month following the date ONRR publishes notice of its decision in the

        (ii) If an Indian tribe requests exclusion from an index zone for less than all of its leases, ONRR will approve the request only if the excluded leases may be segregated into one or more groups based on separate fields within the reservation.

        (2) An Indian tribe may ask ONRR to terminate exclusion of its leases from valuation under this section. ONRR will consult with BIA regarding the request.

        (i) If ONRR approves the request, you must value your production under § 1206.172 beginning with production on the first day of the second month following the date ONRR publishes notice of its decision in the

        (ii) Termination of an exclusion under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section cannot take effect earlier than 1 year after the first day of the production month that the exclusion was effective.

        (3) The Indian tribe's request to ONRR under either paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section must be in the form of a tribal resolution.

        (g)  (1)(i) ONRR may exclude any Indian allotted leases from valuation under this section. ONRR will consult with BIA regarding the exclusion.

        (ii) If ONRR excludes your lease, you must value your production under § 1206.174 beginning with production on the first day of the second month following the date ONRR publishes notice of its decision in the

        (iii) If ONRR excludes any Indian allotted leases under this paragraph (g)(1), it will exclude all Indian allotted leases in the same field.

        (2)(i) ONRR may terminate the exclusion of any Indian allotted leases from valuation under this section. ONRR will consult with BIA regarding the termination.

        (ii) If ONRR terminates the exclusion, you must value your production under § 1206.172 beginning with production on the first day of the second month following the date ONRR publishes notice of its decision in the

        § 1206.173   How do I calculate the alternative methodology for dual accounting?

#### § § 1206.173

        (a)  (1) If you are required to perform the accounting for comparison (dual accounting) under § 1206.176, you have two choices. You may elect to perform the dual accounting calculation according to either § 1206.176(a) (called actual dual accounting), or paragraph (b) of this section (called the alternative methodology for dual accounting).

        (2) You must make a separate election to use the alternative methodology for dual accounting for your Indian leases in each ONRR-designated area. Your election for a designated area must apply to all of your Indian leases in that area.

        (i) ONRR will publish in the  a list of the lease prefixes that will be associated with each designated area for purposes of this section. The ONRR-designated areas are as follows:

        (A) Alabama-Coushatta;

        (B) Blackfeet Reservation;

        (C) Crow Reservation;

        (D) Fort Belknap Reservation;

        (E) Fort Berthold Reservation;

        (F) Fort Peck Reservation;

        (G) Jicarilla Apache Reservation;

        (H) ONRR-designated groups of counties in the State of Oklahoma;

        (I) Navajo Reservation;

        (J) Northern Cheyenne Reservation;

        (K) Rocky Boys Reservation;

        (L) Southern Ute Reservation;

        (M) Turtle Mountain Reservation;

        (N) Ute Mountain Ute Reservation;

        (O) Uintah and Ouray Reservation;

        (P) Wind River Reservation; and

        (Q) Any other area that ONRR designates. ONRR will publish a new area designation in the

        (ii) You may elect to begin using the alternative methodology for dual accounting at the beginning of any month. The first election to use the alternative methodology will be effective from the time of election through the end of the following calendar year. Thereafter, each election to use the alternative methodology must remain in effect for 2 calendar years. You may return to the actual dual accounting method only at the beginning of the next election period or with the written approval of ONRR and the tribal lessor for tribal leases, and ONRR for Indian allottee leases in the designated area.

        (iii) When you elect to use the alternative methodology for a designated area, you must also use the alternative methodology for any new wells commenced and any new leases acquired in the designated area during the term of the election.

        (b)  (1) The alternative methodology adjusts the value of gas before processing determined under either § 1206.172 or § 1206.174 to provide the value of the gas after processing. You must use the value of the gas after processing for royalty payment purposes. The amount of the increase depends on your relationship with the owner(s) of the plant where the gas is processed. If you have no direct or indirect ownership interest in the processing plant, then the increase is lower, as provided in the table in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. If you have a direct or indirect ownership interest in the plant where the gas is processed, the increase is higher, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (2) To calculate the value of the gas after processing using the alternative methodology for dual accounting, you must apply the increase to the value before processing, determined in either § 1206.172 or § 1206.174, as follows:

        (i) Value of gas after processing = (value determined under either § 1206.172 or § 1206.174, as applicable) × (1 + increment for dual accounting); and

        (ii) In this equation, the increment for dual accounting is the number you take from the applicable Btu range, determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in the following table:

        (3) The applicable Btu for purposes of this section is the volume weighted-average Btu for the lease computed from measurements at the facility measurement point(s) for gas production from the lease.

        (4) If any of your gas from the lease is processed during a month, use the following two paragraphs to determine which amounts are subject to dual accounting and which dual accounting method you must use.

        (i) Weighted-average Btu content determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is greater than 1,000 Btu's per cubic foot (Btu/cf). All gas production from the lease is subject to dual accounting and you must use the alternative method for all that gas production if you elected to use the alternative method under this section.

        (ii) Weighted-average Btu content determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is less than or equal to 1,000 Btu/cf. Only the volumes of lease production measured at facility measurement points whose quality exceeds 1,000 Btu/cf are subject to dual accounting, and you may use the alternative methodology for these volumes. For gas measured at facility measurement points for these leases where the quality is equal to or less than 1,000 Btu/cf, you are not required to do dual accounting.

        § 1206.174   How do I value gas production when an index-based method cannot be used?

#### § § 1206.174

        (a)  (1) Gas production must be valued under this section in the following situations.

        (i) Your lease is not in an index zone (or ONRR has excluded your lease from an index zone).

        (ii) If your lease is in an index zone and you sell your gas under an arm's-length dedicated contract, then the value of your gas is the higher of the value received under the dedicated contract determined under § 1206.174(b) or the value under § 1206.172.

        (iii) Also use this section to value any other gas production that cannot be valued under § 1206.172, as well as gas plant products, and to value components of the gas stream that have no Btu value (for example, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc.).

        (2) The value for royalty purposes of gas production subject to this subpart is the value of gas determined under this section less applicable allowances determined under this subpart.

        (3) You must determine the value of gas production that is processed and is subject to accounting for comparison using the procedure in § 1206.176.

        (4) This paragraph applies if your lease has a major portion provision. It also applies if your lease does not have a major portion provision but the lease provides for the Secretary to determine value.

        (i) The value of production you must initially report and pay is the value determined in accordance with the other paragraphs of this section.

        (ii) ONRR will determine the major portion value and notify you in the  of that value. The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section which you initially used to report and pay royalties, or the major portion value calculated under this paragraph (a)(4). If the major portion value is higher, you must submit an amended Form ONRR-2014 to ONRR by the due date specified in the written notice from ONRR of the major portion value. Late-payment interest under § 1218.54 of this chapter on any underpayment will not begin to accrue until the date the amended Form ONRR-2014 is due to ONRR.

        (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, ONRR will calculate the major portion value for each designated area (which are the same designated areas as under § 1206.173) using values reported for unprocessed gas and residue gas on Form ONRR-2014 for gas produced from leases on that Indian reservation or other designated area. ONRR will array the reported prices from highest to lowest price. The major portion value is that price at which 25 percent (by volume) of the gas (starting from the highest) is sold. ONRR cannot unilaterally change the major portion value after you are notified in writing of what that value is for your leases.

        (iv) ONRR may calculate the major portion value using different data than the data described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section or data to augment the data described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. This may include price data reported to the State tax authority or price data from leases ONRR has reviewed in the designated area. ONRR may use this alternate or the augmented data source beginning with production on the first day of the month following the date ONRR publishes notice in the  that it is calculating the major portion using a method in this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.

        (b)  (1) The value of gas, residue gas, or any gas plant product you sell under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)-(iv) of this section.

        (i) You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length.

        (ii) In conducting reviews and audits for gas valued based upon gross proceeds under this paragraph, ONRR will examine whether or not your contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then ONRR may require that the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product sold under that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less than the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate, including the additional consideration.

        (iii) If ONRR determines for gas valued under this paragraph that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under an arm's-length contract do not reflect the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, then ONRR will require that the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product be valued under paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section. In these circumstances, ONRR will notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your value.

        (iv) This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those volumes are subject to a lower price specified in the transportation contract. However, if ONRR determines that the price specified in the transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, the lessees must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section.

        (2) ONRR may require you to certify that your arm's-length contract provisions include all of the consideration the buyer pays, either directly or indirectly, for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product.

        (c)  If your gas, residue gas, or any gas plant product is not sold under an arm's-length contract, then you must value the production using the first applicable method of the following three methods:

        (1) The gross proceeds accruing to you under your non-arm's-length contract sale (or other disposition other than by an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of like-quality gas in the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area). For residue gas or gas plant products, the comparable arm's-length contracts must be for gas from the same processing plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from nearby plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors will be considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of gas, residue gas, or gas plant products, volume, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.

        (2) A value determined by consideration of other information relevant in valuing like-quality gas, residue gas, or gas plant products, including gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields or areas, or for residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or other nearby processing plants. Other factors to consider include prices received in spot sales of gas, residue gas or gas plant products, other reliable public sources of price or market information, and other information as to the particular lease operation or the salability of such gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.

        (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine value.

        (d)  If you determine the value of production under paragraph (c) of this section, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.

        (1) Such data will be subject to review and audit, and ONRR will direct you to use a different value if we determine upon review or audit that the value you reported is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.

        (2) You must make all such data available upon request to the authorized ONRR or Indian representatives, to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department, or other authorized persons. This includes your arm's-length sales and volume data for like-quality gas, residue gas, and gas plant products that are sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained from the same processing plant or from nearby processing plants, or from the same or nearby field or area.

        (e)  If ONRR determines that you have not properly determined value, you must pay the difference, if any, between royalty payments made based upon the value you used and the royalty payments that are due based upon the value ONRR established. You also must pay interest computed on that difference under § 1218.54 of this chapter. If you are entitled to a credit, ONRR will provide instructions on how to take that credit.

        (f)  You may ask ONRR for guidance in determining value. You may propose a valuation method to ONRR. Submit all available data related to your proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. ONRR will promptly review your proposal and provide you with a non-binding determination of the guidance you request.

        (g)  (1) For gas, residue gas, and gas plant products valued under this section, under no circumstances may the value of production for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee (including its affiliates) for gas, residue gas and/or any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances and processing allowances determined under this subpart.

        (2) For gas plant products valued under this section and not valued under § 1206.173, the alternative methodology for dual accounting, the minimum value of production for each gas plant product is as follows:

        (i) Leases in certain States and areas have specific minimum values.

        (A) For production from leases in Colorado in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, and Texas, the monthly average minimum price reported in commercial price bulletins for the gas plant product at Mont Belvieu, Texas, minus 8.0 cents per gallon.

        (B) For production in Arizona, in Colorado outside the San Juan Basin, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, the monthly average minimum price reported in commercial price bulletins for the gas plant product at Conway, Kansas, minus 7.0 cents per gallon;

        (ii) You may use any commercial price bulletin, but you must use the same bulletin for all of the calendar year. If the commercial price bulletin you are using stops publication, you may use a different commercial price bulletin for the remaining part of the calendar year; and (iii) If you use a commercial price bulletin that is published monthly, the monthly average minimum price is the bulletin's minimum price. If you use a commercial price bulletin that is published weekly, the monthly average minimum price is the arithmetic average of the bulletin's weekly minimum prices. If you use a commercial price bulletin that is published daily, the monthly average minimum price is the arithmetic average of the bulletin's minimum prices for each Wednesday in the month.

        (h)  You are required to place gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition and market the gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Indian lessor. When your gross proceeds establish the value under this section, that value must be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services to place the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market the gas, the cost of which ordinarily is your responsibility.

        (i)  For gas, residue gas, and gas plant products valued under this section, value must be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contract revision or amendment, if you fail to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you are entitled, you must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments must be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If you make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your contract but the purchaser refuses, and you take reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, you will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph is not intended to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where your purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part, or timely, for a quantity of gas, residue gas, or gas plant product.

        (j)  Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in an ONRR redetermination of value under this section will be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.

        (k)  Certain information submitted to ONRR to support valuation proposals, including transportation allowances and processing allowances, may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made under this subpart must be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

        § 1206.175   How do I determine quantities and qualities of production for computing royalties?

#### § § 1206.175

        (a) For unprocessed gas, you must pay royalties on the quantity and quality at the facility measurement point BLM either allowed or approved.

        (b) For residue gas and gas plant products, you must pay royalties on your share of the monthly net output of the plant even though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary storage.

        (c) If you have no ownership interest in the processing plant and you do not operate the plant, you may use the contract volume allocation to determine your share of plant products.

        (d) If you have an ownership interest in the plant or if you operate it, use the following procedure to determine the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products attributable to you for royalty payment purposes:

        (1) When the net output of the processing plant is derived from gas obtained from only one lease, the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products on which you must pay royalty is the net output of the plant.

        (2) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease must be in the same proportions as the ratios obtained by dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the total amount of gas delivered from all leases.

        (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of non-uniform content, the volumes of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease are based on theoretical volumes of residue gas and gas plant products measured in the lease gas stream. You must calculate the portion of net plant output of residue gas and gas plant products attributable to each lease as follows:

        (i) First, compute the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products attributable to the lease by multiplying the lease volume of the gas stream by the tested residue gas content (mole percentage) or gas plant product (GPM) content of the gas stream;

        (ii) Second, calculate the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products delivered from all leases by summing the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products delivered from each lease; and

        (iii) Third, calculate the theoretical quantities of net plant output of residue gas and of gas plant products attributable to each lease by multiplying the net plant output of residue gas, or gas plant products, by the ratio in which the theoretical volumes of residue gas, or gas plant products, is the numerator and the theoretical volume of residue gas, or gas plant products, delivered from all leases is the denominator.

        (4) You may request ONRR approval of other methods for determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease. If ONRR approves a different method, it will be applicable to all gas production from your Indian leases that is processed in the same plant.

        (e) You may not take any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas incurred prior to the facility measurement point will not be subject to royalty if BLM determines that the loss was unavoidable.

        § 1206.176   How do I perform accounting for comparison?

#### § § 1206.176

        (a) This section applies if the gas produced from your Indian lease is processed and that Indian lease requires accounting for comparison (also referred to as actual dual accounting). Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the actual dual accounting value, for royalty purposes, is the greater of the following two values:

        (1) The combined value of the following products:

        (i) The residue gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas determined under either § 1206.172 or § 1206.174, less any applicable allowances; and

        (ii) Any drip condensate associated with the processed gas recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing determined under § 1206.52, less applicable allowances.

        (2) The value of the gas prior to processing determined under either § 1206.172 or § 1206.174, including any applicable allowances.

        (b) If you are required to account for comparison, you may elect to use the alternative dual accounting methodology provided for in § 1206.173 instead of the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) Accounting for comparison is not required for gas if no gas from the lease is processed until after the gas flows into a pipeline with an index located in an index zone or into a mainline pipeline not in an index zone. If you do not perform dual accounting, you must certify to ONRR that gas flows into such a pipeline before it is processed.

        (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if you value any gas production from a lease for a month using the dual accounting provisions of this section or the alternative dual accounting methodology of § 1206.173, then the value of that gas is the minimum value for any other gas production from that lease for that month flowing through the same facility measurement point.

        (e) If the weighted-average Btu quality for your lease is less than 1,000 Btu's per cubic foot, see § 1206.173(b)(4)(ii) to determine if you must perform a dual accounting calculation.

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 47006, July 21, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1206.250   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1206.250

        (a) This subpart is applicable to all coal produced from Federal coal leases. The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of coal produced for royalty purposes, of all coal from Federal leases consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws and lease terms.

        (b) If the specific provisions of any statute or settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease subject to the requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any regulation in this subpart then the statute, lease provision, or settlement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        (c) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty payments. ONRR or an authorized State may require you to provide records for the audit by one or more of the methods specified in 30 CFR 1217.10.

        § 1206.251   Definitions.

#### § § 1206.251

        The definitions in § 1206.20 do not apply to this subpart. For purposes of this subpart:

        means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.

        means a deduction used in determining value for royalty purposes. Coal washing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for coal washing. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point of delivery remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant.

        means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and economic characteristics. _Area_ boundaries are not officially designated and the areas are not necessarily named.

        means:

        (1) A contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:

        (i) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;

        (ii) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and

        (iii) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which ONRR may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

        (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. The ONRR may require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as well as when the contract was executed.

        means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.

        means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.

        means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.

        means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. _Coal washing_ may include, but is not limited to, operations such as flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related handling (or combination thereof).

        means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.

        (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and disposition of the coal produced. _Gross proceeds_ includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Federal Government. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also includes but is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or fees, and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.

        means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for a Federal coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal—or the land covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.

        means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment responsibility.

        means coal that has similar chemical and physical characteristics.

        means coal that is sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.

        means an underground or surface excavation or series of excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, and handling of lease products.

        means a method for calculating market value of coal at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at the mine.

        means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant produces.

        is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the deduction as a separate line item on the form ONRR-4430.

        means by individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture.

        means the contract type or general disposition ( arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation or washing allowance.

        means the price received under any sales transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of time, usually not exceeding one year.

        § 1206.252   Information collection.

#### § § 1206.252

        The information collection requirements contained in this subpart have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501  The forms, filing date, and approved OMB control numbers are identified in part 1210 of this subchapter.

        § 206.253   Coal subject to royalties—general provisions.

#### § § 206.253

        (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM under 43 CFR part 3400) from a Federal lease subject to this part is subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise disposed of by the lessee on or off the lease.

        (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation received by the lessee for other losses.

        (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production method used to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond;  underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste pits or slurry ponds initially mined from Federal leases shall be allocated to such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Federal lands. The lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which individual Federal lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be allocated. However, nothing in this section requires payment of a royalty on coal for which a royalty has already been paid.

        § 1206.254   Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

#### § § 1206.254

        For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information will be reported on appropriate forms required under 30 CFR part 1210 of this subchapter.

        § 1206.255   Point of royalty determination.

#### § § 1206.255

        (a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Federal coal in marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as determined jointly by BLM and ONRR.

        (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. ONRR may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of degradation of the resource.

        (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, unless otherwise provided for at § 1206.256(d).

        § 1206.256   Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

#### § § 1206.256

        (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which provide for the determination of royalty on a cents-per-ton (or other quantity) basis.

        (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as determine by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.

        (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other processing or preparation of the coal.

        (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the provisions of § 1206.257, and royalties shall be paid at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.

        § 1206.257   Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

#### § § 1206.257

        (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which provide for the determination of royalty as a percentage of the amount of value of coal (ad valorem). The value for royalty purposes of coal from such leases shall be the value of coal determined under this section, less applicable coal washing allowances and transportation allowances determined under §§ 1206.258 through 1206.262, or any allowance authorized by § 1206.265. The royalty due shall be equal to the value for royalty purposes multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.

        (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (5) of this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the ONRR may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be based on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the coal production, including the additional consideration.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the coal production be valued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's reported coal value.

        (4) ONRR may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.

        (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee demonstrates, to ONRR's satisfaction, were not part of the total consideration paid for the purchase of coal production.

        (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be determined in accordance with this section.

        (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the first applicable criterion:

        (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Price, time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the coal;

        (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;

        (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy;

        (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the saleability of certain types of coal;

        (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back method or any other reasonable method shall be used to determine value.

        (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent with the provisions contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, that value does not require ONRR's prior approval. However, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and ONRR will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.

        (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the authorized ONRR or State representatives, to the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive such information, arm's-length sales value and sales quantity data for like-quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the area.

        (3) A lessee shall notify ONRR if it has determined value pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue of his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notification required by this section is a one-time notification due no later than the month the lessee first reports royalties on the form ONRR-4430 using a valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) or (v) of this section.

        (e) If ONRR determines that a lessee has not properly determined value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are due based upon the value established by ONRR. The lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to § 1218.202 of this subchapter. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, ONRR will provide instructions for the taking of that credit.

        (f) The lessee may request a value determination from ONRR. In that event, the lessee shall propose to ONRR a value determination method, and may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until ONRR issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal. The ONRR shall expeditiously determine the value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After ONRR issues its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and less applicable allowances determined pursuant to §§ 1206.258 through 1206.262 and 1206.265.

        (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value established under this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.

        (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless ONRR approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.

        (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in a redetermination by ONRR of value under this section shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.

        (k) Certain information submitted to ONRR to support valuation proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances under § 1206.265, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made under this part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

        § 1206.258   Washing allowances—general.

#### § § 1206.258

        (a) For ad valorem leases subject to § 1206.257, ONRR shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to § 1206.257 was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.

        (b) If ONRR determines that a lessee has improperly determined a washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter, or shall be entitled to a credit without interest.

        (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to Federal leases.

        (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a cost of washing.

        (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

        § 1206.259   Determination of washing allowances.

#### § § 1206.259

        (a)  (1) For washing costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. ONRR's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration paid, then the ONRR may require that the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's washing costs.

        (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.

        (b)  (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual washing allowance.

        (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing during the reported period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the wash plant.

        (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes, rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.

        (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.

        (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of the ONRR.

        (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a wash plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original operator/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a wash plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.

        (B) ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.

        (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is not royalty bearing.

        (c) —(1)  (i) The lessee must notify ONRR of an allowance based on incurred costs by using a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430.

        (ii) ONRR may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by ONRR.

        (2)  (i) The lessee must notify ONRR of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430.

        (ii) For new washing facilities or arrangements, the lessee's initial washing deduction shall include estimates of the allowable coal washing costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the washing system or, if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar washing systems.

        (iii) Upon request by ONRR, the lessee shall submit all data used to prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by ONRR.

        (d)  (1) If a lessee nets a washing allowance on the Form ONRR-4430, then the lessee shall be assessed an amount up to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per lease sales type code per sales period.

        (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount of that underpayment.

        (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter.

        (e)  (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under § 1218.202 of this subchapter from the date when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee repays the difference to ONRR. If the actual washing allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.

        (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form ONRR-4430 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR.

        (f)  The provisions of this section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of washing costs.

        § 1206.260   Allocation of washed coal.

#### § § 1206.260

        (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.

        (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.

        (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.

        § 1206.261   Transportation allowances—general.

#### § § 1206.261

        (a) For ad valorem leases subject to § 1206.257, where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point remote from the lease or mine, ONRR shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs incurred to:

        (1) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a sales point which is remote from both the lease and mine; or

        (2) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a wash plant when that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.

        (b) Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.

        (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.

        (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal transported.

        (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

        (d) If, after a review and/or audit, ONRR determines that a lessee has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus interest, determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.

        (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation costs to Federal leases.

        § 1206.262   Determination of transportation allowances.

#### § § 1206.262

        (a)  (1) For transportation costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The lessee must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration paid, then the ONRR may require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.

        (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

        (b)  (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form ONRR-4430. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.

        (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.

        (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.

        (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of ONRR.

        (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.

        (B) ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.

        (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        (3) A lessee may apply to ONRR for exception from the requirement that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. ONRR will grant the exception only if the lessee has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency or by a State regulatory agency (for Federal leases). ONRR shall deny the exception request if it determines that the rate is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, ONRR shall deny the exception request if:

        (i) No Federal or State regulatory agency costs analysis exists and the Federal or State regulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to investigate under ONRR timely objections upon filing; and

        (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined under this section.

        (c) —(1)  (i) The lessee must notify ONRR of an allowance based on incurred costs by using a separate line entry on the form ONRR-4430.

        (ii) ONRR may require that a lessee submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by ONRR.

        (2)  (i) The lessee must notify ONRR of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line entry on Form ONRR-4430.

        (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's initial deduction shall include estimates of the allowable coal transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation systems.

        (iii) Upon request by ONRR, the lessee shall submit all data used to prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by ONRR.

        (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal- or State-agency-approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (d)  (1) If a lessee nets a transportation allowance on Form ONRR-4430, the lessee shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per lease sales type code per sales period.

        (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount of that underpayment.

        (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter.

        (e)  (1) If the actual coal transportation allowance is less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under § 1218.202 of this subchapter from the date when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee repays the difference to ONRR. If the actual transportation allowance is greater than amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.

        (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form ONRR-4430 to reflect actual costs, together with any payments, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR.

        (f)  The provisions of this section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of transportation costs.

#### § § 1206.263

        § 1206.264   In-situ and surface gasification and liquefaction operations.

#### § § 1206.264

        If an ad valorem Federal coal lease is developed by in-situ or surface gasification or liquefaction technology, the lessee shall propose the value of coal for royalty purposes to ONRR. The ONRR will review the lessee's proposal and issue a value determination. The lessee may use its proposed value until ONRR issues a value determination.

        § 1206.265   Value enhancement of marketable coal.

#### § § 1206.265

        If, prior to use, sale, or other disposition, the lessee enhances the value of coal after the coal has been placed in marketable condition in accordance with § 1206.257(h), the lessee shall notify ONRR that such processing is occurring or will occur. The value of that production shall be determined as follows:

        (a) A value established for the feedstock coal in marketable condition by application of the provisions of § 1206.257(c)(2)(i) through (iv); or,

        (b) In the event that a value cannot be established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, then the value of production will be determined in accordance with § 1206.257(c)(2)(v) and the value shall be the lessee's gross proceeds accruing from the disposition of the enhanced product, reduced by ONRR-approved processing costs and procedures including a rate of return on investment equal to two times the Standard and Poor's BBB bond rate applicable under § 1206.259(b)(2)(v).

        § 1206.301   Value basis for royalty computation.

#### § § 1206.301

        (a) The gross value for royalty purposes shall be the sale or contract unit price times the number of units sold,  That where the authorized officer determines:

        (1) That a contract of sale or other business arrangement between the lessee and a purchaser of some or all of the commodities produced from the lease is not a bona fide transaction between independent parties because it is based in whole or in part upon considerations other than the value of the commodities, or

        (2) That no bona fide sales price is received for some or all of such commodities because the lessee is consuming them, the authorized officer shall determine their gross value, taking into account: (i) All prices received by the lessee in all bona fide transactions, (ii) Prices paid for commodities of like quality produced from the same general area, and (iii) Such other relevant factors as the authorized officer may deem appropriate; and  That in a situation where an estimated value is used, the authorized officer shall require the payment of such additional royalties, or allow such credits or refunds as may be necessary to adjust royalty payment to reflect the actual gross value.

        (b) The lessee is required to certify that the values reported for royalty purposes are bona fide sales not involving considerations other than the sale of the mineral, and he may be required by the authorized officer to supply supporting information.

        § 1206.350   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1206.350

        (a) This subpart applies to all geothermal resources produced from Federal geothermal leases issued pursuant to the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (GSA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) (30 U.S.C. 1001 ). The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe how to calculate royalties and direct use fees for geothermal production.

        (b) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty and fee payments. ONRR or an authorized State may require you to provide records for the audit by one or more of the methods specified in 30 CFR 1217.10.

        (c) In some cases, the regulations in this subpart may be inconsistent with a statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision. If this happens, the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency. For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply:

        (1) “Settlement agreement” means a settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation.

        (2) “Written agreement” means a written agreement between the lessee and the ONRR Director or Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget of the Department of the Interior that:

        (i) Establishes a method to determine the royalty from any lease that ONRR expects at least would approximate the value or royalty established under this subpart; and

        (ii) Includes a value or gross proceeds determination under § 1206.364 of this subpart.

        (1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of noncontrol that ONRR may rebut.

        (2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership of another person, ONRR will consider the following factors in determining whether there is control under the circumstances of a particular case:

        (i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors;

        (ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership: the percentage of ownership or common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, whether a person is the greatest single owner, or whether there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;

        (iii) Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility;

        (iv) The extent of participation by other owners in operations and day-to-day management of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility; and

        (v) Other evidence of power to exercise control over or common control with another person.

        means a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes.

        means a contract or agreement between independent persons who are not affiliates and who have opposing economic interests regarding that contract. To be considered arm's length for any production month, a contract must satisfy this definition for that month, as well as when the contract was executed.

        means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty or fee payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, fees, rents, or bonuses on Federal geothermal leases.

        means minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbon gas, and helium), found in solution or in association with geothermal steam, that no person would extract and produce by themselves because they are worth less than 75 percent of the value of the geothermal steam or because extraction and production would be too difficult.

        means a facility where byproducts are placed in marketable condition.

        means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of moving byproducts to a point of sale or delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a byproduct recovery facility.

        means:

        A lease that BLM issued after August 8, 2005, except for a lease issued in response to an application that was pending on August 8, 2005, for which the lessee does not make an election under 43 CFR 3200.8(b).

        means:

        A lease that BLM issued before August 8, 2005, for which the lessee has converted to the royalty rate or direct use fee terms under 43 CFR 3212.25.

        means generation of electricity that is sold or is subject to sale, including the electricity or energy that is reasonably required to produce the resource used in production of electricity for sale or to convert geothermal energy into electrical energy for sale.

        means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.

        means a facility that uses the heat or other energy of the geothermal resource for direct use purposes.

        means a power plant or other facility that uses a geothermal resource to generate electricity.

        means the land surface vertically projected over a subsurface geothermal reservoir encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all geothermal accumulations known to be within that reservoir. Geothermal fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located.

        means the movement of lease production from the wellhead to the point of utilization.

        means a deduction for the lessee's reasonable, actual costs of generating plant tailgate electricity.

        means:

        (1) All products of geothermal processes, including indigenous steam, hot water, and hot brines;

        means a geothermal lease issued under the authority of the GSA, unless the context indicates otherwise.

        means any person to whom the United States issues a geothermal lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty, fee, or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a geothermal lease as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty, fee, or other payment responsibility. This also includes any affiliate of the lessee that uses the geothermal resource to generate electricity, in a direct use process, or to recover byproducts, or any affiliate that sells or transports lease production.

        means lease products that are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the disposition from the field or area of such lease products.

        (a) If you sold geothermal resources produced from a Class I, II, or III lease at arm's length that the purchaser uses to generate electricity, then the royalty on the geothermal resources is the gross proceeds accruing to you from the sale of the geothermal resource to the arm's-length purchaser multiplied by either:

        (1) The royalty rate in your lease; or

        (2) The royalty rate that BLM prescribes or calculates under 43 CFR 3211.17. See § 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds under arm's-length sales.

        (b) If you use the geothermal resource in your own power plant for the generation and sale of electricity, the following provisions apply

        (1) For Class I leases, you must determine the royalty on produced geothermal resources in accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:

        (i) The gross proceeds accruing to you from the arm's-length sale of the electricity less applicable deductions determined under §§ 1206.353 and 1206.354 of this part, multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease. See § 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds under arm's-length sales. Under no circumstances may the deductions reduce the royalty value of the geothermal resource to zero; or

        (ii) A royalty determined by any other reasonable method approved by ONRR under § 1206.364 of this subpart.

        (2) For Class II and Class III leases, the royalty on geothermal resources produced is your gross proceeds from the sale of electricity multiplied by the royalty rate BLM prescribed for your lease under 43 CFR 3211.17. See § 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds under arm's-length sales. You may not reduce gross proceeds by any deductions.

        § 1206.353   How do I determine transmission deductions?

#### § § 1206.353

        (a) If you determine the value of your geothermal resources under § 1206.352(b)(1)(i) of this subpart, you may subtract a transmission deduction from the gross proceeds you received for the sale of electricity to determine the plant tailgate value of the electricity.

        (1) The transmission deduction consists of either or both of two components:

        (i) Transmission line costs as determined under paragraph (b) of this section; and

        (ii) Wheeling costs if the electricity is transmitted across a third party's transmission line under an arm's-length wheeling agreement.

        (2) You may deduct the actual costs you (including your affiliate(s)) incur for transmitting electricity under your arm's-length wheeling contract.

        (b) To determine your transmission line cost, you must follow the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

        (1) Your transmission line costs are your actual costs associated with the construction and operation of a transmission line for the purpose of transmitting electricity attributable and allocable to your power plant utilizing Federal geothermal resources.

        (i) You must determine the monthly transmission line cost component of the transmission deduction by multiplying the annual transmission line cost rate (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) by the amount of electricity delivered for the reporting month.

        (ii) You must redetermine the transmission line cost rate annually either at the beginning of the same month of the year in which the power plant was placed into service or at a time concurrent with the beginning of your annual corporate accounting period. The period you select must coincide with the same period you chose for the generating deduction under § 1206.354(b)(1). After you choose a deduction period, you may not later elect to use a different deduction period without ONRR approval.

        (2) Your actual transmission line costs during the reporting period include:

        (i) Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;

        (ii) Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section; and either

        (iii) Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section or

        (iv) A return on the capital investment in the transmission line under paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section.

        (c)(1) Allowable capital costs under paragraph (b) of this section are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transmission line.

        (2)(i) You may include a return on capital you invested in the purchase of real estate for transmission facilities if:

        (A) Such purchase is necessary; and

        (B) The surface is not part of the Federal lease.

        (ii) The rate of return will be the same rate determined under paragraph (k) of this section.

        (d) Allowable operating expenses include:

        (1) Operations supervision and engineering;

        (2) Operations labor;

        (3) Fuel;

        (4) Utilities;

        (5) Materials;

        (6) Ad valorem property taxes;

        (7) Rent;

        (8) Supplies; and

        (9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating or maintenance expense that you can document.

        (e) Allowable maintenance expenses include:

        (1) Maintenance of the transmission line;

        (2) Maintenance of equipment;

        (3) Maintenance labor; and

        (4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.

        (f) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transmission line is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (g) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment, or a return on capital investment in the transmission line. After a lessee has elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.

        (h)(1) To compute depreciation, you must use a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract, or other depreciation period acceptable to ONRR. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.

        (2) A change in ownership of a transmission line does not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing transmission line costs.

        (3) With or without a change in ownership, you may depreciate a transmission line only once.

        (i) To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning of the period for which you are calculating the transmission deduction by the rate of return provided in paragraph (k) of this section.

        (j) To compute a return on capital investment in the transmission line, multiply the allowable capital investment in the transmission line by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section. There is no allowance for depreciation.

        (k) The rate of return must be 2.0 multiplied by the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. Redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        (l) Calculate the deduction for transmission costs based on your cost of transmitting electricity through each individual transmission line.

        (m)(1) For new transmission facilities or arrangements, base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable electricity transmission costs for the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data for the transmission line or, if such data are not available, use estimates based on data for similar transmission lines.

        (2) When actual cost information is available, you must amend your prior Form ONRR-2014 reports to reflect actual transmission costs deductions for each month for which you reported and paid based on estimated transmission costs. You must pay any additional royalties due (together with interest computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter). You are entitled to a credit for or refund of any overpaid royalties.

        (n) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR may require you to submit arm's-length transmission contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents and all other data used to calculate the deduction. You must comply with any such requirements within the time ONRR specifies. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1212 of this chapter.

        (o) At the completion of transmission line dismantlement and salvage operations, you may report a credit for or request a refund of royalties in an amount equal to the royalty rate times the amount by which actual transmission line dismantlement costs exceed actual income attributable to salvage of the transmission line.

        § 1206.354   How do I determine generating deductions?

#### § § 1206.354

        (a) If you determine the value of your geothermal resources under § 1206.352(b)(1)(i) of this subpart, you may deduct your reasonable actual costs incurred to generate electricity from the plant tailgate value of the electricity (usually the transmission-reduced value of the delivered electricity). You may deduct the actual costs you incur for generating electricity under your arm's-length power plant contract.

        (b)(1) You must base your generating costs deduction on your actual annual costs associated with the construction and operation of a geothermal power plant.

        (i) You must determine your monthly generating deduction by multiplying the annual generating cost rate (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) by the amount of plant tailgate electricity measured (or computed) for the reporting month. The generating cost rate is determined from the annual amount of your plant tailgate electricity.

        (ii) You must redetermine your generating cost rate annually either at the beginning of the same month of the year in which the power plant was placed into service or at a time concurrent with the beginning of your annual corporate accounting period. The period you select must coincide with the same period chosen for the transmission deduction under § 1206.353(b)(1). After you choose a deduction period, you may not later elect to use a different deduction period without ONRR approval.

        (2) Your generating costs are your actual power plant costs during the reporting period, including:

        (i) Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;

        (ii) Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section; and either

        (iii) Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section; or

        (iv) A return on capital investment in the power plant under paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section.

        (c)(1) Allowable capital costs under paragraph (b) of this section are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the power plant or are required by the design specifications of the power conversion cycle.

        (2)(i) You may include a return on capital you invested in the purchase of real estate for a power plant site if:

        (A) The purchase is necessary; and,

        (B) The surface is not part of the Federal lease.

        (ii) The rate of return will be the same rate determined under paragraph (k) of this section.

        (3) You may not deduct the costs of gathering systems and other production-related facilities.

        (d) Allowable operating expenses include:

        (1) Operations supervision and engineering;

        (2) Operations labor;

        (3) Auxiliary fuel and/or utilities used to operate the power plant during down time;

        (4) Utilities;

        (5) Materials;

        (6) Ad valorem property taxes;

        (7) Rent;

        (8) Supplies; and

        (9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense.

        (e) Allowable maintenance expenses include:

        (1) Maintenance of the power plant;

        (2) Maintenance of equipment;

        (3) Maintenance labor; and

        (4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.

        (f) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the power plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (g) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment, or a return on capital investment in the power plant. After a lessee has elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.

        (h)(1) To compute depreciation, you must use a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract, or other depreciation period acceptable to ONRR. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.

        (2) A change in ownership of the power plant does not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing generating costs.

        (3) With or without a change in ownership, you may depreciate a power plant only once.

        (i) To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning of the period for which you are calculating the generating deduction allowance by the rate of return provided in paragraph (k) of this section.

        (j) To compute a return on capital investment in the power plant, multiply the allowable capital investment in the power plant by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section. There is no allowance for depreciation.

        (k) The rate of return must be 2.0 multiplied by the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. You must redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        § 1206.355   How do I calculate royalty due on geothermal resources I sell at arm's length to a purchaser for direct use?

#### § § 1206.355

        If you sell geothermal resources produced from Class I, II, or III leases at arm's length to a purchaser for direct use, then the royalty on the geothermal resource is the gross proceeds accruing to you from the sale of the geothermal resource to the arm's-length purchaser multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease or that BLM prescribes under 43 CFR 3211.18. See § 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds under arm's-length sales.

        § 1206.356   How do I calculate royalty or fees due on geothermal resources I use for direct use purposes?

#### § § 1206.356

        If you use the geothermal resource for direct use:

        (a) For Class I leases, you must determine the royalty due on geothermal resources in accordance with the first applicable of the following three paragraphs.

        (1) The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same direct-use facility multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease. In evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the following factors will be considered: time of execution, duration, terms, volume, quality of resource, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the resource.

        (2) The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable alternative energy source (fuel) multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease. The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable alternative energy source will be based on the amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct use facility in place of the geothermal resource. That amount of thermal energy (in Btu) displaced by the geothermal resource will be determined by the equation:

        (3) A royalty determined by any other reasonable method approved by ONRR or the Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget of the Department of the Interior, under § 1206.364 of this part.

        (b) For geothermal resources produced from Class II and Class III leases, you must multiply the appropriate fee from the schedule in subparagraph (b)(1) of this section by the number of gallons or pounds you produce from the direct use lease each month.

        (1) You must use the following fee schedule to calculate fees due under this section:

        (i) For direct use geothermal resources with an average monthly inlet temperature of 130 °F or less, you must pay only the lease rental.

        (ii) The ONRR, in consultation with BLM, will develop and publish a revised fee schedule in the  as needed.

        (iii) ONRR, in consultation with BLM, will calculate revised fees schedules using the following formulas:

        (2) The fee that you report is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.

        (3) The schedule of fees established under this paragraph will apply to any Class III lease with respect to any royalty payments previously made when the lease was a Class I lease that were due and owing, and were paid, on or after July 16, 2003. To use this provision, you must provide ONRR data showing the amount of geothermal production in pounds or gallons of geothermal fluid to input into the fee schedule (see 43 CFR part 3276).

        (i) If the royalties you previously paid are less than the fees due under this section, you must pay the difference plus interest on that difference computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter.

        (ii) If the royalties you previously paid are more than the fees due under this section, then you are entitled to a refund or credit from ONRR of 50 percent of the overpaid royalties. You are also entitled to a refund or credit of any interest that you paid on the overpaid royalties.

        (c) For geothermal resources other than hot water, ONRR will determine fees on a case-by-case basis.

        § 1206.357   How do I calculate royalty due on byproducts?

#### § § 1206.357

        (a) If you sell byproducts, you must determine the royalty due on the byproducts that are royalty-bearing under:

        (1) Applicable lease terms of Class I leases and of Class III leases that do not elect to be subject to all of the BLM regulations promulgated for leases issued after August 8, 2005, under 43 CFR 3200.7(a)(2), or

        (2) Applicable statutory provisions at 30 U.S.C. 1004(a)(2) for Class II leases and for Class III leases that do elect to be subject to all of the BLM regulations promulgated for leases issued after August 8, 2005, under 43 CFR 3200.7(a)(2).

        (b) You must determine the royalty due on the byproducts by multiplying the royalty rate in your lease or that BLM prescribes under 43 CFR 3211.19 by a value of the byproducts determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following subparagraphs:

        (1) The gross proceeds accruing to you from the arm's-length sale of the byproducts, less any applicable byproduct transportation allowances determined under §§ 1206.358 and 1206.359. See § 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds;

        (2) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published or publicly available spot-market prices, or information submitted by the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the saleability of certain byproducts; or

        (3) Any other reasonable valuation method approved by ONRR.

        § 1206.358   What are byproduct transportation allowances?

#### § § 1206.358

        (a) When you determine the value of byproducts at a point off the geothermal lease, unit, or participating area, you are allowed a deduction in determining value, for royalty purposes, for your reasonable, actual costs incurred to:

        (1) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or participating area to a sales point or point of delivery that is off the lease, unit, or participating area; or

        (2) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or participating area, or from a geothermal use facility to a byproduct recovery facility when that byproduct recovery facility is off the lease, unit, or participating area and, if applicable, from the recovery facility to a sales point or point of delivery off the lease, unit, or participating area.

        (b) Costs for transporting geothermal fluids from the lease to the geothermal use facility, whether on or off the lease, are not includible in the byproduct transportation allowance.

        (c)(1) When you transport byproducts from a lease, unit, participating area, or geothermal use facility to a byproduct recovery facility, you are not required to allocate transportation costs between the quantity of marketable byproducts and the rejected waste material. The byproduct transportation allowance is authorized for the total production that is transported. You must express byproduct transportation allowances as a cost per unit of marketable byproducts transported.

        (2) For byproducts that are extracted on the lease, unit, participating area, or at the geothermal use facility, the byproduct transportation allowance is authorized for the total byproduct that is transported to a point of sale off the lease, unit, or participating area. You must express byproduct transportation allowances as a cost per unit of byproduct transported.

        (3) You may deduct transportation costs only when you sell, deliver, or otherwise utilize the transported byproduct and report and pay royalties on the byproduct.

        (d)  (1) You must use a discrete field on Form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of a transportation allowance.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR may require you to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. You must comply with any such requirements within the time ONRR specifies. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1212 of this chapter.

        (e) Byproduct transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, review, and audit. If, after a review or audit, ONRR determines that you have improperly determined a byproduct transportation allowance, you must pay any additional royalties due (plus interest computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter). You are entitled to a credit for or refund of any overpaid royalties.

        (f) If you commingled byproducts produced from Federal and non-Federal leases for transportation, you may not disproportionately allocate transportation costs to Federal lease production.

        § 1206.359   How do I determine byproduct transportation allowances?

#### § § 1206.359

        (a) For transportation costs you incur under an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance will be the reasonable, actual costs you incurred for transporting the byproducts under that contract.

        (1) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from you to the transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration you paid, ONRR may require you to determine the byproduct transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) If ONRR determines that the consideration you paid under an arm's-length byproduct transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, ONRR will require you to determine the byproduct transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your transportation costs.

        (3) Where your payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not established on a dollars-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration you paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

        (b) If you transport the byproduct yourself or under a non-arm's-length transportation arrangement, the byproduct transportation allowance is your reasonable actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including:

        (1) Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;

        (2) Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section; and either

        (3) Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section; or

        (4) A return on capital investment in the transportation system under paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section.

        (c)(1) Allowable capital costs under paragraph (b) of this section are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (2)(i) You may include a return on capital you invested in the purchase of real estate to locate the byproduct transportation facilities if:

        (A) The purchase is necessary; and

        (B) The surface is not part of a Federal lease.

        (ii) The rate of return will be the same rate determined in paragraph (k) of this section.

        (3) You may not deduct the costs of gathering systems and other production-related facilities.

        (d) Allowable operating expenses include:

        (1) Operations supervision and engineering;

        (2) Operations labor;

        (3) Fuel;

        (4) Utilities;

        (5) Materials;

        (6) Ad valorem property taxes;

        (7) Rent;

        (8) Supplies; and

        (9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that you can document.

        (e) Allowable maintenance expenses include:

        (1) Maintenance of the transportation system;

        (2) Maintenance of equipment;

        (3) Maintenance labor; and

        (4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document.

        (f) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (g) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee may use either paragraphs (h) and (i) or paragraph (j) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR approval.

        (h)(1) To compute depreciation, you must use a straight-line depreciation method based on either the life of the equipment or the life of the geothermal project which the transportation system services. After you choose the basis for depreciation, you may not change that basis without ONRR approval. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.

        (2) A change in ownership of a transportation system does not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing transportation costs.

        (3) With or without a change in ownership, you may depreciate a transportation system only once.

        (i) To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning of the period for which you are calculating the transportation allowance by the rate of return provided in paragraph (k) of this section.

        (j) To compute a return on capital investment in the transportation system, the allowed cost will be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section. There is no allowance for depreciation.

        (k) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. You must redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

        (l)(1) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable byproduct transportation costs for the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems.

        (2) When actual cost information is available, you must amend your prior Form ONRR-2014 reports to reflect actual byproduct transportation cost deductions for each month for which you reported and paid based on estimated byproduct transportation costs. You must pay any additional royalties due (together with interest computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter). You are entitled to a credit for or a refund of any overpaid royalties.

        § 1206.360   What records must I keep to support my calculations of royalty or fees under this subpart?

#### § § 1206.360

        If you determine royalties or direct use fees for your geothermal resource under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of the royalty value or the fee you paid. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1212 of this chapter.

        (a) You must be able to show:

        (1) How you calculated the royalty value or fee you reported, including all allowable deductions; and

        (2) How you complied with this subpart.

        (b) Upon request, you must submit all data to ONRR. You must comply with any such requirement within the time ONRR specifies.

        § 1206.361   How will ONRR determine whether my royalty or direct use fee payments are correct?

#### § § 1206.361

        (a)(1) The royalties or direct use fees that you report are subject to monitoring, review, and audit. The ONRR may review and audit your data, and ONRR will direct you to use a different measure of royalty value, gross proceeds, or fee, whichever is applicable, if it determines that the reported value, gross proceeds, or fee is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.

        (2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, measure of gross proceeds, or fee, you must either pay any royalties or fees due (together with interest computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter) or report a credit for or request a refund of any overpaid royalties or fees.

        (b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds either for the sale of electricity or the sale of a geothermal resource, in conducting reviews and audits ONRR will examine whether your sales contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you for the geothermal resource or electricity. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, or the gross proceeds accruing to you under a contract do not reflect reasonable consideration because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, ONRR may require you to increase the gross proceeds to reflect any additional consideration. Alternatively, for Class I leases, ONRR may require you to use another valuation method in the regulations applicable to dispositions other than under an arm's-length contract. ONRR will notify you to give you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your gross proceeds.

        (c) For arm's-length sales, you have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's length.

        (d) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your sales contract include all of the consideration the buyer paid you, either directly or indirectly, for the electricity or geothermal resource.

        (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, under no circumstances will the value of production for royalty purposes under a Class I lease where the geothermal resources are sold before use be less than the gross proceeds accruing to you.

        (f) Gross proceeds for the sale of electricity or for the sale of the geothermal resource will be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract.

        (1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you fail to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.

        (2) Contract revisions or amendments you make must be in writing and signed by all parties to the contract.

        (3) If you make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your contract, but the purchaser refuses and you take reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, you will owe no additional royalties unless or until you receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. This paragraph (f)(3) will not be construed to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources or electricity.

        § 1206.362   What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?

#### § § 1206.362

        You must place geothermal resources and byproducts in marketable condition and market the geothermal resources or byproducts for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal Government. If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract in determining royalty, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform to place the geothermal resources or byproducts in marketable condition or to market the geothermal resources or byproducts.

        § 1206.363   When is an ONRR audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process considered final?

#### § § 1206.363

        Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, no audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in a redetermination by ONRR of royalty or fees due under this subpart is considered final or binding as against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until ONRR formally closes the audit period in writing.

        § 1206.364   How do I request a value or gross proceeds determination?

#### § § 1206.364

        (a) You may request a value determination from ONRR regarding any geothermal resources produced from a Class I lease or for byproducts produced from a Class I, Class II, or Class III lease. You may also request a gross proceeds determination for a Class II or Class III lease. Your request must:

        (1) Be in writing;

        (2) Identify specifically all leases involved, all owners of interests in those leases, and the operator(s) for those leases;

        (3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request;

        (4) Include copies of all relevant documents;

        (5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and

        (6) Suggest your proposed gross proceeds calculation or valuation method.

        (b) In response to your request:

        (1) The Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget, may issue a determination; or

        (2) ONRR may issue a determination; or

        (3) ONRR may inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations; and

        (ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals.

        (c)(1) A determination signed by the Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget, is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.

        (2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a determination, you must make any adjustments in royalty payments that follow from the determination and, if you owe additional royalties, pay the royalties owed together with late payment interest computed under § 1218.302 of this chapter.

        (3) A determination signed by the Assistant Secretary is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

        (d) A determination issued by ONRR is binding on ONRR and delegated States, but not on you, with respect to the specific situation addressed in the determination unless ONRR (for ONRR-issued determinations) or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.

        (1) A determination by ONRR is not an appealable decision or order under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the determination, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR part 1290.

        (e) In making a determination, ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable criteria in this subpart.

        (f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which any determination is based takes precedence over the determination after the effective date of the statute or regulation, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the determination.

        (g) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary generally will not retroactively modify or rescind a determination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, unless:

        (1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts; or

        (2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from the facts on which the guidance was based.

        (h) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.365.

        § 1206.365   Does ONRR protect information I provide?

#### § § 1206.365

        Certain information you submit to ONRR regarding royalties or fees on geothermal resources or byproducts, including deductions and allowances, may be exempt from disclosure. To the extent applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data you submit that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure. All requests for information must be submitted under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.

        § 1206.366   What is the nominal fee that a State, tribal, or local government lessee must pay for the use of geothermal resources?

#### § § 1206.366

        If a State, tribal, or local government lessee uses a geothermal resource without sale and for public purposes—other than commercial production or generation of electricity—the State, tribal, or local government lessee must pay a nominal fee. A nominal fee means a slight or  fee. ONRR will determine the fee on a case-by-case basis.

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 47012, July 21, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1206.450   What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?

#### § § 1206.450

        (a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to establish the value, for royalty purposes, of all coal from Indian Tribal and allotted leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma).

        (b) If the specific provisions of any statute, treaty, or settlement agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease subject to the requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any regulation in this subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision, or settlement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

        (c) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty payments. ONRR or an authorized Tribe may require you to provide records for the audit by one or more of the methods specified in 30 CFR 1217.10.

        (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the administration of Indian coal leases are discharged in accordance with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.

        § 1206.451   Definitions.

#### § § 1206.451

        The definitions in § 1206.20 do not apply to this subpart. For purposes of this subpart:

        means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.

        means an approved, or an ONRR-initially accepted deduction in determining value for royalty purposes. Coal washing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for coal washing, or an approved or ONRR-initially accepted deduction for the costs of washing coal, determined pursuant to this subpart. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point of delivery remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant, or an approved ONRR-initially accepted deduction for costs of such transportation, determined pursuant to this subpart.

        means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and economic characteristics. _Area_ boundaries are not officially designated and the areas are not necessarily named.

        means a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership: ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which ONRR may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. ONRR may require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month, as well as when the contract was executed.

        means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.

        means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.

        means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.

        means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.

        means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. _Coal washing_ may include, but is not limited to, operations such as flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related handling (or combination thereof).

        means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.

        (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and disposition of the coal produced. _Gross proceeds_ includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also includes but is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or fees, and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.

        means any Indian for whom land or an interest in land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to Federal restriction against alienation.

        means any _Indian Tribe_, band, nation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.

        means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for an Indian coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal—or the land covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.

        means any person to whom the Indian Tribe or an Indian allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment responsibility.

        means coal that has similar chemical and physical characteristics.

        means coal that is sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.

        means an underground or surface excavation or series of excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, and handling of lease products.

        means a method for calculating market value of coal at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at the mine.

        means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant produces.

        means the Office of Natural Resources Revenue of the Department of the Interior.

        means by individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture.

        means the contract type or general disposition ( arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation or washing allowance.

        means the price received under any sales transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of time, usually not exceeding one year.

        § 1206.452   Coal subject to royalties—general provisions.

#### § § 1206.452

        (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR group 3400) from an Indian lease subject to this part is subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise disposed of by the lessee on or off the lease.

        (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation received by the lessee for other losses.

        (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production method used to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond;  underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste pits or slurry ponds initially mined from Indian leases shall be allocated to such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Indian lands. The lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which individual Indian lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be allocated. However, nothing in this section requires payment of a royalty on coal for which a royalty has already been paid.

        § 1206.453   Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

#### § § 1206.453

        For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information will be reported on appropriate forms required under part 1210 of this subchapter.

        § 1206.454   Point of royalty determination.

#### § § 1206.454

        (a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Indian coal in marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as determined jointly by BLM and ONRR.

        (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. ONRR may ask BLM or BIA to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of degradation of the resource.

        (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, unless otherwise provided for at § 1206.455(d).

        § 1206.455   Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

#### § § 1206.455

        (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty on a cents-per-ton (or other quantity) basis.

        (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as determined by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.

        (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other processing or preparation of the coal.

        (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the provisions of § 1206.456, and royalties shall be paid at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.

        § 1206.456   Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

#### § § 1206.456

        (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty as a percentage of the amount of value of coal (ad valorem). The value for royalty purposes of coal from such leases shall be the value of coal determined pursuant to this section, less applicable coal washing allowances and transportation allowances determined pursuant to §§ 1206.457 through 1206.461, or any allowance authorized by § 1206.464. The royalty due shall be equal to the value for royalty purposes multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.

        (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (5) of this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then ONRR may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be based on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the coal production, including the additional consideration.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the coal production be valued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's reported coal value.

        (4) ONRR may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.

        (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee demonstrates, to ONRR's satisfaction, were not part of the total consideration paid for the purchase of coal production.

        (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be determined in accordance with this section.

        (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the first applicable criterion:

        (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the coal;

        (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;

        (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy;

        (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the salability of certain types of coal;

        (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back method or any other reasonable method shall be used to determine value.

        (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent with the provisions contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, that value does not require ONRR's prior approval. However, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and ONRR will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.

        (2) An Indian lessee will make available upon request to the authorized ONRR or Indian representatives, or to the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive such information, arm's-length sales and sales quantity data for like-quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the area.

        (3) A lessee shall notify ONRR if it has determined value pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue or his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notification required by this section is a one-time notification due no later than the month the lessee first reports royalties on the Form ONRR-4430 using a valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) or (v) of this section.

        (e) If ONRR determines that a lessee has not properly determined value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are due based upon the value established by ONRR. The lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to § 1218.202 of this subchapter. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, ONRR will provide instructions for the taking of that credit.

        (f) The lessee may request a value determination from ONRR. In that event, the lessee shall propose to ONRR a value determination method, and may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until ONRR issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal. ONRR shall expeditiously determine the value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After ONRR issues its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and less applicable allowances determined pursuant to §§ 1206.457 through 1206.461 and 1206.464.

        (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at no cost to the Indian lessor. Where the value established pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.

        (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless ONRR approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.

        (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in a redetermination by ONRR of value under this section shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian Tribes or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.

        (k) Certain information submitted to ONRR to support valuation proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances pursuant to §§ 1206.457 through 1206.461 and 1206.464, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made under this part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or diminish in any manner whatsoever the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all information as such lessor may be lawfully entitled from ONRR or such lessor's lessee directly under the terms of the lease or applicable law.

        § 1206.457   Washing allowances—general.

#### § § 1206.457

        (a) For ad valorem leases subject to § 1206.456, ONRR shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to § 1206.456 was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.

        (b) If ONRR determines that a lessee has improperly determined a washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.

        (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to Indian leases.

        (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a cost of washing.

        (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

        § 1206.458   Determination of washing allowances.

#### § § 1206.458

        (a)  (1) For washing costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. ONRR's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one of Form ONRR-4292, Coal Washing Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4292 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration paid, then ONRR may require that the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's washing costs.

        (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.

        (b)  (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior ONRR approval of washing allowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form ONRR-4292 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4292 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. ONRR will monitor the allowance deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its actual washing allowance.

        (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing during the reported period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the wash plant.

        (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.

        (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.

        (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of ONRR.

        (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a wash plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original operator/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a wash plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.

        (B) ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.

        (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent washing allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section).

        (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is not royalty bearing.

        (c) —(1)  (i) With the exception of those washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the initial Form ONRR-4292 prior to, or at the same time, as the washing allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract is reported on Form ONRR-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report. A Form ONRR-4292 received by the end of the month that the Form ONRR-4430 is due shall be considered to be received timely.

        (ii) The initial Form ONRR-4292 shall be effective for a reporting period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier.

        (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form ONRR-4292 within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).

        (iv) ONRR may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by ONRR.

        (v) Washing allowances which are based on arm's-length contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by ONRR in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become effective.

        (vi) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.

        (2)  (i) With the exception of those washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form ONRR-4292 prior to, or at the same time as, the washing allowance determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation is reported on Form ONRR-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report. A Form ONRR-4292 received by the end of the month that the Form ONRR-4430 is due shall be considered to be timely received. The initial reporting may be based on estimated costs.

        (ii) The initial Form ONRR-4292 shall be effective for a reporting period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or until the washing under the non-arm's-length contract or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.

        (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form ONRR-4292 containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If coal washing is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form ONRR-4292 its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated coal washing allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous period plus or minus any adjustments which are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases which will affect the allowance. Form ONRR-4292 must be received by ONRR within 3 months after the end of the previous reporting period, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).

        (iv) For new wash plants, the lessee's initial Form ONRR-4292 shall include estimates of the allowable coal washing costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the plant, or if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar coal wash plants.

        (v) Washing allowances based on non-arm's-length or no contract situations which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by ONRR in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become effective.

        (vi) Upon request by ONRR, the lessee shall submit all data used by the lessee to prepare its Forms ONRR-4292. The data shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by ONRR.

        (vii) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.

        (3) ONRR may establish coal washing allowance reporting dates for individual leases different from those specified in this subpart in order to provide more effective administration. Lessees will be notified of any change in their reporting period.

        (4) Washing allowances must be reported as a separate line on the Form ONRR-4430, unless ONRR approves a different reporting procedure.

        (d)  (1) If a lessee deducts a washing allowance on its Form ONRR-4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.

        (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount of that underpayment.

        (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter.

        (e)  (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed pursuant to § 1218.202 of this subchapter, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to deduct a washing allowance. If the actual washing allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken during the reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.

        (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form ONRR-4430 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR.

        (f)  The provisions of this section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of washing costs.

        § 1206.459   Allocation of washed coal.

#### § § 1206.459

        (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.

        (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.

        (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.

        § 1206.460   Transportation allowances—general.

#### § § 1206.460

        (a) For ad valorem leases subject to § 1206.456, where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point remote from the lease or mine, ONRR shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs incurred to:

        (1) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a sales point which is remote from both the lease and mine; or

        (2) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a wash plant when that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.

        (b) Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.

        (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.

        (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal transported.

        (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

        (d) If, after a review and/or audit, ONRR determines that a lessee has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus interest, determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.

        (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation costs to Indian leases.

        § 1206.461   Determination of transportation allowances.

#### § § 1206.461

        (a)  (1) For transportation costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. ONRR's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one of Form ONRR-4293, Coal Transportation Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4293 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee.

        (2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration paid, then ONRR may require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.

        (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

        (b)  (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior ONRR approval of transportation allowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form ONRR-4293 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4293 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. ONRR will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.

        (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.

        (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.

        (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.

        (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

        (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of ONRR.

        (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.

        (B) ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.

        (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly average as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the reporting period of which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section).

        (3) A lessee may apply to ONRR for exception from the requirement that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. ONRR will grant the exception only if the lessee has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency for Indian leases. ONRR shall deny the exception request if it determines that the rate is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, ONRR shall deny the exception request if:

        (i) No Federal regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the Federal regulatory agency has declined to investigate pursuant to ONRR timely objections upon filing; and

        (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined under this section.

        (c) —(1)  (i) With the exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the initial Form ONRR-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract is reported on Form ONRR-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report.

        (ii) The initial Form ONRR-4293 shall be effective for a reporting period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier.

        (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form ONRR-4293 within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period). Lessees may request special reporting procedures in unique allowance reporting situations, such as those related to spot sales.

        (iv) ONRR may require that a lessee submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by ONRR.

        (v) Transportation allowances that are based on arm's-length contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by ONRR in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become effective.

        (vi) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.

        (2)  (i) With the exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form ONRR-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation is reported on Form ONRR-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report. The initial report may be based on estimated costs.

        (ii) The initial Form ONRR-4293 shall be effective for a reporting period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or until the transportation under the non-arm's-length contract or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.

        (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form ONRR-4293 containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If the transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form ONRR-4293 its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments that are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the allowance. Form ONRR-4293 must be received by ONRR within 3 months after the end of the previous reporting period, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).

        (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's initial Form ONRR-4293 shall include estimates of the allowable transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the transportation system, or, if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation systems.

        (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no contract-based transportation allowances that are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by ONRR in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become effective.

        (vi) Upon request by ONRR, the lessee shall submit all data used to prepare its Form ONRR-4293. The data shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by ONRR.

        (vii) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.

        (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal-agency-approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (3) ONRR may establish reporting dates for individual lessees different than those specified in this paragraph in order to provide more effective administration. Lessees will be notified as to any change in their reporting period.

        (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line item on Form ONRR-4430, unless ONRR approves a different reporting procedure.

        (d)  (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form ONRR-4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.

        (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount of that underpayment.

        (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined in accordance with § 1218.202 of this subchapter.

        (e)  (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form ONRR-4430 for each month during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties due plus interest, computed pursuant to § 1218.202 of this subchapter, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken during the reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.

        (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form ONRR-4430 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR.

        (f)  The provisions of this section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of transportation costs.

#### § § 1206.462

        § 1206.463   In-situ and surface gasification and liquefaction operations.

#### § § 1206.463

        If an ad valorem Federal coal lease is developed by in-situ or surface gasification or liquefaction technology, the lessee shall propose the value of coal for royalty purposes to ONRR. ONRR will review the lessee's proposal and issue a value determination. The lessee may use its proposed value until ONRR issues a value determination.

        § 1206.464   Value enhancement of marketable coal.

#### § § 1206.464

        If, prior to use, sale, or other disposition, the lessee enhances the value of coal after the coal has been placed in marketable condition in accordance with § 1206.456(h), the lessee shall notify ONRR that such processing is occurring or will occur. The value of that production shall be determined as follows:

        (a) A value established for the feedstock coal in marketable condition by application of the provisions of § 1206.456(c)(2)(i) through (iv); or,

        (b) In the event that a value cannot be established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, then the value of production will be determined in accordance with § 1206.456(c)(2)(v) and the value shall be the lessee's gross proceeds accruing from the disposition of the enhanced product, reduced by ONRR-approved processing costs and procedures including a rate of return on investment equal to two times the Standard and Poor's BBB bond rate applicable under § 1206.458(b)(2)(v).

Title to the royalty oil, or to the quantity thereof in a commingled stream, passes from the Federal Government to the purchaser at this designated point, which is specified in the royalty oil contract. For onshore leases, the delivery point will be on or adjacent to the lease, except as provided in § 1208.8(a) of this part. In instances where an onshore delivery point is designated for offshore royalty oil, such point generally will be the first onshore point where the price of the oil, including transportation costs, can be determined and where the purchaser can either exchange or take delivery of the oil. The Government does not guarantee physical access to the oil at such point.

        means the _Director_ of ONRR, who is responsible for its overall direction, or his or her delegate(s).

        means the Department of the Interior, including the Secretary or his or her delegate(s).

        means a refiner of crude oil that meets the following criteria for eligibility to purchase royalty oil:

Crude oil received in exchange for such refiner's own production is considered to be that refiner's own production for purposes of this section.

        (2) For the purchase of royalty oil from leases on the OCS, it means a refiner that qualifies as a small business enterprise under the rules of the Small Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).

        (2) If there were no such sales, or if the Secretary finds that there were an insufficient number of such sales to equitably determine such value, computed at the average unit price at which oil was sold pursuant to other leases in the same region of the OCS during such period, or

        (3) If there were no sales of oil from such region during such period, or if the Secretary finds that there are an insufficient number of such sales to equitably determine such value, at an appropriate price determined by the Secretary.

        means a contractual agreement with the Federal Government which authorizes the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas on Federal lands onshore or on the OCS.

        means a sale conducted as a result of substantial additional royalty oil becoming available in a specific area prior to the scheduled expiration date of royalty oil contracts in effect for that area.

        means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, or any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease.

        means a notice published by DOI in the  (and in other printed media when appropriate, such as a newspaper or magazine of general or specialized circulation) to advise interested parties of the availability of royalty oil for purchase by eligible refiners and the approximate volume of royalty oil available to the applicants.

        means the Outer Continental Shelf, as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331(a).

        means the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331  as amended by 43 U.S.C. 1801 ).

        means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is marketed or used as such.

        means an eligible refiner with at least one operating refinery which is located within the area designated as the preference eligible area in the “Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil.” A refiner may be deemed to be a preference eligible refiner if it owns a refinery located in the preference eligible area which is not operational if the refiner meets the requirements of § 1208.7(g) of this part.

        means anyone who acquires royalty oil sold by DOI under the Federal Government's Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program and who has a contractual obligation under an agreement to purchase royalty oil.

        means an offering of royalty oil previously allocated in a specific sale but subsequently turned back to ONRR. A reallocation would only be made if substantial amounts of royalty oil are turned back.

        means gasoline, kerosene, distillates (including Number 2 fuel oil), refined lubricating oils, or diesel fuel.

        means that amount of oil that DOI takes in kind in partial or full satisfaction of a lessee's royalty or net profit share obligations as determined by whatever lease interest the lessee holds under an applicable mineral leasing law.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Department of the Interior or his/her delegate(s).

        means an oil and gas lease originally issued by any State and currently maintained in effect pursuant to section 6 of the OCSLA.

        means an oil and gas lease originally issued by the United States pursuant to section 8 of the OCSLA.

        § 1208.4   Royalty oil sales to eligible refiners.

#### § § 1208.4

        (a)  The Secretary may evaluate crude oil market conditions from time to time. The evaluation will include, among other things, the availability of crude oil and the crude oil requirements of the Federal Government, primarily those requirements concerning matters of national interest and defense. The Secretary will review these items and will determine whether eligible refiners have access to adequate supplies of crude oil and whether such oil is available to eligible refiners at equitable prices. Such determinations may be made on a regional basis. The determination by the Secretary shall be published in the  concurrent with or included in the “Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil” required by § 1208.5.

        (b)  (1) Upon a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section that eligible refiners do not have access to adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices, the Secretary, at his or her discretion, may elect to take in kind some or all of the royalty oil accruing to the United States from oil and gas leases on Federal lands onshore and on the OCS. The Secretary may authorize ONRR to offer royalty oil for sale to eligible refiners only for use in their refineries and not for resale (other than under an exchange agreement).

        (2) All sales of royalty oil from onshore leases will be priced at the royalty value that would have been determined for that oil pursuant to 30 CFR part 1206 had the royalties been paid in value rather than taken in kind. All sales of royalty oil from OCS leases will be priced at the fair market value of the oil including associated transportation costs to the designated delivery point, if applicable.

        (3) An eligible refiner must have a representative at a sale in order to participate. The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, establish purchase limitations and withhold any royalty oil from any offering.

        (c) Upon a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section that eligible refiners do have access to adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices, ONRR will not take royalties in kind from oil and gas leases for exclusive sale to such refiners. Such determinations may be made on a regional basis.

        (d)  The ONRR generally will not conduct interim sales. However, interim sales may be held at the discretion of the Secretary if substantial addition royalty oil becomes available. The potentially eligible refiners, individually or collectively, must submit documentation demonstrating that adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices are not available for purchase. Although sufficient documentation must be submitted, it is not mandatory for each potentially eligible refiner to participate in a submission of such documentation to be determined eligible. The documentation must be submitted to ONRR for a determination as to whether an interim sale is needed.

        § 1208.5   Notice of royalty oil sale.

#### § § 1208.5

        If the Secretary decides to take royalty oil in kind for sale to eligible refiners, ONRR will issue a “Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil” specifying the manner in which the sale is to be effected, the approximate quantity of royalty oil to be offered, information required in applications, the closing date for the receipt of applications for royalty oil, and other general administrative details concerning the application, allocation, and contract award process for the royalty oil. The Notice will describe generally the terms under which the royalty oil contracts will be awarded and will specify which applicants will be deemed preference eligible refiners in the sale proceedings. The Notice will also contain guidelines for reallocation procedures in the event substantial quantities of royalty oil sold in that specific sale are subsequently turned back to ONRR. Only those purchasers that hold ongoing contracts from that specific sale will be allowed to participate in any reallocation, which would be voluntary, and then only if they continue to meet eligibility requirements as set forth in §§ 1208.2 and 1208.7. If a reallocation is held prior to the effective date of the contracts as specified in the “Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil”, all eligible refiners that selected a lease or leases in that specific sale would be allowed to participate, pursuant to the procedures in the Notice.

        § 1208.6   General application procedures.

#### § § 1208.6

        (a) To apply for the purchase of royalty oil, an applicant must file a Form MMS-4070 with ONRR in accordance with instructions provided in the “Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil” and in accordance with any instructions issued by ONRR for completion of Form MMS-4070. The applicant will be required to submit a letter of intent from a qualified financial institution stating that it would be granted surety coverage for the royalty oil for which it is applying, or other such proof of surety coverage, as deemed acceptable by ONRR. The letter of intent must be submitted with a completed Form MMS-4070.

        (b) In addition to any other application requirements specified in the Notice, the following information is required on Form MMS-4070 at the time of application:

        (1) Name and address of the applicant, the location of the applicant's refinery or refineries, and disclosure of the applicant's affiliation with any other persons.

        (2) The capacity of the applicant's refineries in barrels of crude oil throughput per calendar day and a tabulation for the past 12 months of oil processed for each refinery, identified as to source (from own production or from other sources).

        (3) Identification of any Government royalty oil contracts under which the applicant is currently receiving royalty oil.

        (4) Identification of the locations (area/region and State) where the applicant proposes to purchase royalty oil, the volume of oil requested, and the specific refineries in which the oil will be refined.

        (5) A certification from the applicant that it is an eligible refiner for the purchase of Government royalty oil, as defined in § 1208.2 of this part.

> [52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]

        § 1208.7   Determination of eligibility.

#### § § 1208.7

        (a) The ONRR will examine each application and may request additional information if the information in the application is inadequate. An application received after the close of the application period will be rejected. If additional information is requested by ONRR, it must be received by the time specified or the application will be rejected.

        (b) After the close of the application period and the receipt of any additional requested information, ONRR will determine which applicants may participate in the royalty oil sale and the quantity of royalty oil which each applicant is authorized to purchase.

        (c) When applications are filed by two or more eligible refiners for the same royalty oil, the oil will be allocated among such applicants on an equitable basis as determined by ONRR. Preference eligible refiners will be given priority in the allocation procedures in sales and subsequent reallocations of royalty oil.

        (d) No eligible refiner shall be awarded contracts for volumes of royalty oil that, when added to volumes of other Federal royalty oil being received, are in excess of 60 percent of the combined refinery capacity of that refiner.

        (e) The ONRR may exclude any section 6 lease from a royalty oil sale.

        (f) If two or more eligible refiners are related through common ownership or control or otherwise affiliated, only one of them shall be entitled to an allotment of royalty oil from a specific sale.

        (g) Any applicant whose refinery is not in operation during the 60-day period prior to the date of the royalty oil sale shall not be entitled to participate in the sale unless such applicant self-certifies and demonstrates to the satisfaction of ONRR that it will begin operations by the first month in which oil becomes available under a royalty oil contract. If operations do not begin by that month, ONRR will terminate the contract.

        (h) Applicants or purchasers that have delinquent balances with ONRR as of the date of a royalty oil sale or subsequent reallocation will not be allowed to participate in that sale or reallocation. If a person which is controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or otherwise affiliated with an applicant or purchaser has such delinquent balances, the applicant or purchaser will not be allowed to participate in a royalty oil sale or reallocation. To the extent a purchaser or affiliated person has appealed a billing and posted a surety instrument in accordance with the contract terms and applicable ONRR regulations or other law, the balance shall not be considered delinquent.

        (i) A purchaser must meet the eligibility criteria on the date of contract issuance. However, a change in a purchaser's eligibility status during the term of the contract will not affect the purchaser's right to continue that contract until its term expires, including any extensions thereof.

        § 1208.8   Transportation and delivery.

#### § § 1208.8

        (a) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from onshore leases to the purchaser at a point on or adjacent to the lease pursuant to the terms of the lease. If the purchaser does not have access to its onshore royalty oil entitlement at facilities on or adjacent to the lease, the operator of the lease must designate an alternate delivery point at no additional cost to the purchaser or the Government. The purchaser must have physical access to the oil at the alternate delivery point and such point must be approved by ONRR.

        (b) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore leases issued after September 1969 at a delivery point to be designated by ONRR. The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore leases issued before October 1969 or from section 6 leases at a delivery point to be designated by the lessee. If the delivery point is on or immediately adjacent to the lease, the royalty oil will be delivered without cost to the Federal Government as an undivided portion of production in marketable condition at pipeline connections or other facilities provided by the lessee, unless other arrangements are approved by ONRR. If the delivery point is not on or immediately adjacent to the lease, ONRR will reimburse the lessee for the reasonable cost of transportation to such point in an amount not to exceed the transportation allowance determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 1206. The ONRR will include such transportation costs in the price charged for the oil taken in kind to reflect the value of the oil at the delivery point. Arrangements for delivery of the royalty oil from, or exchange of the oil at, the delivery point, and related transportation costs, are the responsibility of the purchaser of the royalty oil. In addition, quality differentials between the royalty oil to which a purchaser is entitled and the oil which is made available at the delivery point are matters to be resolved between the purchaser and the operator.

        (c) When the purchaser has physical access to the royalty oil at the delivery point, the lessee shall deliver such oil in marketable condition at pipeline connections or other facilities designated by ONRR. If the lessee is unable to provide the royalty portion of actual production from the lease, the lessee must provide crude oil to the purchaser which is equivalent in volume or value to the royalty oil to which the purchaser is entitled. The lessee will deliver the royalty oil to the purchaser during normal operating hours and in reasonable quantities and intervals. The lessee will make available and the purchaser will accept delivery of the royalty oil entitlement no later than the last day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the oil was produced. Failure to accept deliveries shall constitute grounds for the termination of the contract.

        (d) Upon termination of deliveries under a royalty oil contract, the transportation allowance and delivery point designation authorized by this section no longer will remain in effect.

        § 1208.9   Agreements.

#### § § 1208.9

        (a) A purchaser must submit to ONRR two copies of any written third-party agreements, or two copies of a full written explanation of any oral third-party agreements, relating to the method and costs of delivery of royalty oil, or crude oil exchanged for the royalty oil, from the point of delivery under the contract to the purchaser's refinery. In addition, the purchaser must submit copies of agreements pertaining to quality differentials which may occur between leases and delivery points.

        (b) A purchaser may not sell royalty oil which it purchases pursuant to this part except for purposes of an exchange for other crude oil on a volume or equivalent value basis.

        (c) Royalty oil purchased under this part, or crude oil received in exchange for such royalty oil, must be processed into refined petroleum products in the purchaser's refinery.

        § 1208.10   Notices.

#### § § 1208.10

        (a) The ONRR shall notify each operator, by certified mail, of the Secretary's decision to take royalty oil in kind. This notice shall be mailed at least 45 days in advance of the effective date of delivery and will specify delivery points for offshore oil for OCS leases issued after September 1969.

        (b) Deliveries of royalty oil may be partially terminated only with the written approval of the Director, ONRR.

        (c) Before terminating the delivery of royalty oil taken in kind, ONRR, if possible, will notify each operator by certified mail of the change in requirements at least 30 days in advance of the effective date.

        (d) After ONRR notification that royalty oil will be taken in kind, the operator shall be responsible for notifying each working interest on the Federal lease. As soon as practicable after the date of each royalty oil sale, ONRR will publish in the  a notice of the leases from which royalty oil will be taken, the purchasers of the royalty oil, and the leases from which royalty oil deliveries will be discontinued on terminated contracts.

        (e) A purchaser cannot transfer, assign, or sell its rights or interest in a royalty oil contract without written approval of the Director, ONRR. If the purchaser changes ownership or its assets are sold or liquidated for any reason, it cannot transfer, assign, or sell its rights or interest in the royalty oil contract without written approval of the Director, ONRR. Without express written consent from ONRR for a change in ownership, the royalty oil contract shall be terminated. The successor company must meet the definition of an eligible refiner in § 1208.2 of this part for ONRR to consider assignment of the royalty oil contract.

        § 1208.11   Surety requirements.

#### § § 1208.11

        (a) The eligible purchaser, prior to execution of the contract, shall furnish an “ONRR-specified surety instrument,” in an amount equal to the estimated value of royalty oil that could be taken by the purchaser in a 99-day period, plus related administrative charges. The ONRR may require the purchaser to increase the amount of the surety instrument when necessary to protect the Government's interest or may allow the purchaser to decrease the amount of the surety instrument where necessary to further the purposes of the Royalty-in-Kind Program.

        (b) If a letter of credit is furnished as the surety instrument, it must be effective for a 9-month period beginning the first day the royalty oil contract is effective, with a clause providing for automatic renewal monthly for a new 9-month period. The purchaser or its surety company may elect not to renew the letter of credit at any monthly anniversary date, but must notify ONRR of its intent not to renew at least 30 days prior to the anniversary date. The ONRR may grant the purchaser 45 days to obtain a new surety instrument. If no replacement surety instrument is provided, ONRR will terminate the contract effective at least 6 months prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the letter of credit also may contain a clause providing for automatic termination 6 months after the royalty oil contract terminates. If a certificate of deposit is furnished as the surety instrument, it must be effective for the life of the contract plus 6 months after the royalty oil contract terminates.

        (c) For the purposes of this section, an “ONRR-specified surety instrument” means either: an ONRR-specified surety bond, an ONRR-specified irrevocable letter of credit, or a financial institution book-entry certificate of deposit.

        (d) The “ONRR-specified surety instrument” shall be in a form specified by ONRR instructions or approved by ONRR. A bond must be issued by a qualified surety company that has been approved by the Department of the Treasury. An irrevocable letter of credit or a certificate of deposit must be from a financial institution acceptable to ONRR. The ONRR will use a bank rating service to determine whether a financial institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument deemed adequate to indemnify the Government from loss or damage.

        (e) All surety instruments must be in a form acceptable to ONRR and must include such other specific requirements as ONRR may require adequately to protect the Government's interests.

#### § § 1208.12

        (a) All payments to ONRR by a purchaser of royalty oil will be due on the date and at the location specified in the contract, or, if there is no contractual provision, as specified by ONRR. The purchaser shall tender all payments to ONRR in accordance with § 1218.51 of this chapter. Payments made by a payor pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and § 1208.13 also shall be tendered in accordance with § 1218.51 of this chapter.

        (b)(1) Payments from a purchaser of royalty oil not received by ONRR when due, or that portion of the payment less than the full amount due, will be subject to a late payment charge equivalent to an interest assessment on the amount past due for the number of days that the payment is late at the underpayment rate applicable under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

        (2) The ONRR may assess interest to a payor for any underpayments which are the result of the payor's late or underreporting, or for adjustments reported by the payor, or made as a result of audit, reconciliation, or other procedures. The interest for late payment and underpayment will be assessed pursuant to § 1218.54 of this chapter.

        (c) If payment for royalty oil is not received by the due date specified in the contract, a notice of nonreceipt will be sent to the purchaser by certified mail. If payment is not received by ONRR within 15 days from the date of such notice, ONRR may cancel the contract and collect under the ONRR-specified surety instrument. See § 1208.11.

        (d) If the purchaser disagrees with the amount of payment due, it must pay the amount due as computed by ONRR, unless the purchaser appeals the amount and posts an ONRR-specified surety instrument pursuant to the provisions of 30 CFR part 1243. The ONRR may, at its discretion, waive the appeal surety requirements if it determines that the contract surety instrument is sufficient protection for an amount under appeal.

        (4) If the information on a previously reported Form ONRR-4430 is no longer correct, you must submit a revised Form ONRR-4430 by the last day of the month in which you learn that the previously reported information is no longer correct, except when the last day of the month falls on a weekend or holiday.

#### § § 1218.42

        (a) Interest due from a payor on any underpayment for any Federal mineral lease or leases (onshore or offshore) and on any Indian tribal mineral lease or leases for any production month shall not be reduced by offsetting against that underpayment any overpayment made by the payor on any other lease or leases, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Interest due from a payor or any underpayment on any Indian allotted lease shall not be reduced by offsetting against any overpayment on any other Indian allotted lease under any circumstances.

        (b) Royalties attributed to production from a lease or leases which should have been attributed to production from a different lease or leases may be offset to determine whether and to what extent an underpayment exists on which interest is due if the following conditions are met:

        (1) The error results from attributing and reporting an equal volume of production, produced from a lease or leases during a particular production month, to a different lease or leases from which it was not produced for the same or another production month;

        (2) The payor is the same for the lease or leases to which production was attributed and the lease or leases to which it should have been attributed;

        (3) The payor submits production reports, pipeline allocation reports, or other similar documentary evidence pertaining to the specific production involved which verifies the correct production information;

        (4) The lessor is the same for the leases involved (in the case of Indian tribal leases, the same tribe is the lessor); and

        (5) The ultimate recipients of any royalty or other lease revenues under any applicable permanent indefinite appropriations are the same for, and receive the same percentage of revenue from, the leases.

        (c) If ONRR assesses late-payment interest and the payor asserts that some or all of the interest assessed is not owed pursuant to the exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the burden is on the payor to demonstrate that the exception applies in the specific circumstances of the case.

        (d) The exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section shall not operate to relieve any payor of liability imposed by statute or regulation for erroneous reporting.

        § 1218.53   Recoupment of overpayments on Indian mineral leases.

#### § § 1218.53

        (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian oil and gas lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form ONRR-2014 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.

        (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished to ONRR pursuant to instructions for reporting recoupments in the ONRR revenue reporter handbook. See part 1210 of this chapter. Recouping overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another allotted lease is specifically prohibited.

        (c) Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental, bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order, or terms of an Indian mineral lease.

        (d) The ONRR Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary for ONRR to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.

        (b) Any State shall be assessed for its share of any overcharge resulting from a determination that DOI failed to comply with the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended. Each State's share shall be assessed against monies owed to the State. Such assessment shall be first against monies owed to such State as a result of royalty audits prior to January 12, 1983, the enactment date of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, then against other monies owed.

        § 1218.155   Method of payment.

#### § § 1218.155

        (a)  With the exception of first-year rental, the payor shall tender all payments in accordance with § 1218.51. First-year rental shall be paid in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Each lease bid must include a payment for the one-fifth bonus bid deposit amount unless the bidder is otherwise directed by the Secretary. Further instructions on how to make payment with the bid will be included in the notice of each lease offering. EFT may be used as a method of payment for the one-fifth bonus bid amount.

        (2) Beginning with lease offerings held after February 1, 1984, the one-fifth bonus amount received from a high bidder shall be deposited into an escrow account created pursuant to an agreement between the Departments of the Interior and Treasury, pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. The one-fifth bonus funds will be invested in public debt securities. Investment of this amount by the U.S. Government does not indicate acceptance of the bid. The one-fifth bonus amounts submitted with bids other than the highest valid bid will be returned to respective bidders after bids are opened, recorded, and ranked. Return of such amounts will not affect the status, validity, or ranking of bids. The one-fifth bonus bid amount received from any high bidder and held by the Government pending acceptance or rejection, will be returned with actual interest earned, if the bid is subsequently rejected. The interest accrued during the period held in the account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid will accrue to the Government when the bid is accepted.

        (c)  Payment shall be made to ONRR by EFT unless otherwise directed by the Secretary. The payment by EFT via the FRCS must be received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York no later than noon, eastern standard time, on the 11th business day after receipt of the lease forms by the successful bidder. A “business day” is considered to be a day on which the OCS regional office issuing the lease is open for business. The lease will not be executed by the appropriate ONRR official until payment is received. Failure to remit by EFT or as directed by the Secretary within the time specified above will result in forfeiture of the one-fifth bonus bid amount and the lease will not be executed by the appropriate ONRR official. Payors will not be held responsible for late payment due to actions beyond their control, such as mechanical or systems failure of FRCS or FDS. Payors will be held responsible for incorrect actions of their bank which result in late payments. A 2-day grace period will be allowed to make up a deficient payment, but a late payment charge will be assessed for this late payment and a penalty will also be assessed if appropriate. Late payment charges will be assessed in accordance with subpart B of this part.

        (d)  (1) Payors using the appropriate means of payment (EFT, check, etc.) may pay for multiple lease obligations with a single remittance but must ensure that the payment complies with subpart B of this part and the remittance advice adequately identifies the single payment. The format to be used for such identification will be provided by the ONRR Accounting Center.

        (2) Where to pay.

        (3) The ONRR mailing addresses for payments to ONRR are specified in § 1218.51.

        (4) Payments received at the ONRR addresses after 4 p.m. mountain time are considered received the following business day.

        (e)  Payments shall be made to the manager of the appropriate Outer Continental Shelf field office by cash, check or bank draft payable to “Department of the Interior—ONRR” for miscellaneous payments such as:

        § 1218.202   Late payment or underpayment charges.

#### § § 1218.202

        (a) The failure to make timely or proper payment of any monies due pursuant to leases and contracts subject to these rules will result in the collection by ONRR of the full amount past due plus a late payment charge. Exceptions to this late payment charge may be granted when estimated payments on minerals production have already been made timely and otherwise in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR to the operator/lessee. However, late payment charges assessed with respect to any Indian lease, permit, or contract shall be collected and paid to the Indian or tribe to which the amount overdue is owed.

        (b) Late payment charges will be assessed on any late payment or underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date that the payment was received at the ONRR addresses specified in § 1218.51. Payments received at the specified ONRR addresses after 4 p.m. mountain time are considered received the following business day.

        (c) Late payment charges are calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate. In the absence of a specific lease, permit, license or contract provision prescribing a different rate, this percentage assessment rate is prescribed by the Department of the Treasury as the “Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate.”

        (d) This rate is available in the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins that are published prior to the first day of each calendar quarter for application to overdue payments or underpayments in the new calendar quarter. The rate is also published in the Notices section of the  and indexed under “Fiscal Service/Notices/Funds Rate; Treasury Current Value.”

These charges include production, minimum, or advance royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; or any other payments, fees, or assessments that an operator/lessee is required to pay by a specified date. The failure to pay past due payments, including late payment charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement proceedings.

        (f) An overpayment on a lease or leases may be offset against an underpayment on a different lease or leases to determine a net underpayment on which interest is due pursuant to conditions specified in § 1218.42.

        (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian solid mineral lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form ONRR-4430 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.

        (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished to ONRR for reporting recoupments. Call 1-888-201-6416 for instructions. Recouping overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another allotted lease is specifically prohibited.

        (c) Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental, bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order, or terms of an Indian mineral lease.

        (d) The ONRR Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary for ONRR to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.

You may not apply any annual rental paid in excess of the royalty due for a particular lease year as a credit against any royalty due in any subsequent lease year.

        (2) For purposes of this section, the term “royalty” includes any advanced royalty payable under 30 U.S.C. 1004(f) for a cessation of production.

#### § § 1218.306

        (a) You may receive a credit against royalties for in-kind deliveries of electricity you provide under contract to a State or county government if:

        (1) The State or county to which you provide electricity would receive a portion of the royalties you paid in money for the lease under 30 U.S.C. 191 or 30 U.S.C. 1019, except as otherwise provided under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, 30 U.S.C. 355, because your lease is located in that State or county. If your lease is located in more than one State or county, the revenues are paid to the respective States or counties based on their proportionate shares of the total acres in the lease;

        (2) The ONRR approves in advance your contract with the State or county to which you are providing in-kind electricity; and

        (3) Your contract provides that you will use the wholesale value of the electricity for the area where your lease is located to establish the specific methodology to determine the amount of the credit; and

        (b) The maximum credit you may take under this section is equal to the portion of the royalty revenue that ONRR would have paid to the State or county that is a party to the contract had you paid royalty in money on all of the electricity you delivered to the State or county based on the wholesale value of the electricity. You must pay in money any royalty amount that is not offset by the credit allowed under this section, calculated based on the wholesale value of the electricity.

        (c) The electricity the State or county government receives from you satisfies the Secretary's payment obligation to the State or county under 30 U.S.C. 191 or 30 U.S.C. 1019.

        (a)  ONRR will serve all official correspondence to the addressee of record by one of the following methods:

        (1) U.S. Postal Service mail;

        (2) Personal delivery made pursuant to the law of the State in which the service is effected; or

        (3) Private mailing service (such as the United Parcel Service or Federal Express), with signature and date upon delivery acknowledging the addressee of record's receipt of the official correspondence document.

        (b)  (1) We will address official correspondence to the party shown on the most recently received Form ONRR-4444 for the type of correspondence at issue. The company or reporting entity is responsible for notifying ONRR of any name or address changes on Form ONRR-4444. The addressee of record in a part 1290, appeal will be the person or representative making the appeal.

        (2) If we do not receive addressee of record information from you on Form ONRR-4444, we may use the individual name and address, position title, or department name and address in our database, based on previous formal or informal communications or correspondence for the type of official correspondence at issue. Alternately, we may obtain contact information from public records and send correspondence to:

        (i) The registered agent;

        (ii) Any corporate officer; or

        (iii) The addressee of record shown in the files of any State Secretary; Corporate Commission; Federal or state agency that keeps official records of business entities or corporations; or other appropriate public records for individuals, business entities, or corporations.

        (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, ONRR considers official correspondence as served on the date that it is received at the address of record. A receipt, signed and dated by any person at that address, is evidence of service and of the date of service. If official correspondence is served in more than one manner and the dates differ, the date of the earliest service is used.

        (d)  If we cannot make delivery to the addressee of record after making a reasonable effort, we deem official correspondence as constructively served seven days after the date when we mail the document. This provision covers situations such as those where no delivery occurs because:

        (1) The addressee of record has moved without filing a forwarding address;

        (2) The forwarding order has expired;

        (3) Delivery was expressly refused; or

        (4) The document was unclaimed and the attempt to deliver it is substantiated by:

        (ii) A private mailing service, as described in this section; or

        (iii) The person who attempted to make delivery using some other method of service.

We will publish a notice of any increase in administrative costs assessed under this section in the  The ONRR also may assess $436 for administrative costs that continue to accrue during any appeal process if:

        (1) The notice we provide you under 30 CFR 1218.703 grants you the right to appeal and you exercise that right; and

        (2) Your appeal is denied and we refer the delinquent debt to Treasury under this subpart.

        (d)  The ONRR will apply a partial or installment payment you make on a delinquent debt sent to Treasury, first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.

        (e)  The ONRR may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory or regulatory authority.

        (f)  The Director may decide to waive collection of all or part of the administrative costs under paragraph (c) of this section either in compromise of the delinquent debt or if the Director determines collection of this charge would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Government's best interest.

      Subpart C—Oil and Gas, Onshore

        § 1219.100   What is ONRR's timing of payment to the States?

#### § § 1219.100

        ONRR will pay a State's share of mineral leasing revenues to the State not later than the last business day of the month in which the U.S. Treasury issues a warrant authorizing the disbursement, except for any portion of such revenues which is under challenge and placed in a suspense account pending resolution of a dispute.

        § 1219.101   What receipts are subject to an interest charge?

#### § § 1219.101

        (a) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) will pay the State its proportionate share of any interest charge for royalty and related monies that are placed in a suspense account pending resolution of any matters that may disallow distribution and disbursement. Such monies not disbursed by the last business day of the month following receipt by ONRR will accrue interest until paid.

        (b) Upon resolution of any matters that may disallow distribution and disbursement, ONRR will disburse the suspended monies found due in paragraph (a) of this section, plus interest, to the State, under the provisions of § 1219.100.

        (c) ONRR will apply paragraph (a) of this section to revenues that ONRR cannot disburse to the State because the payor/lessee provided to ONRR incorrect, inadequate, or incomplete information, which prevented ONRR from identifying the proper recipient of the payment.

        § 1219.102   What is ONRR's method of payment to the States?

#### § § 1219.102

        ONRR will disburse monies to a State by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

        § 1219.103   How will ONRR manage payments to Indian accounts?

#### § § 1219.103

        ONRR will transfer mineral revenues received from Indian leases to the appropriate Indian accounts that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) manages for allotted and Tribal revenues. These accounts are specifically designated Treasury accounts. ONRR will transfer these revenues to the Indian accounts at the earliest practicable date after such funds are received, but in no case later than the last business day of the month in which ONRR receives these revenues.

        § 1219.104   What are Explanation of Payments to the States and Indian Tribes?

#### § § 1219.104

        (a) ONRR will describe the payments to States and BIA, on behalf of Indian Tribes or Indian allottees, discussed in this part, in ONRR-prepared Explanation of Payment reports. ONRR will prepare these reports at the lease level and will include a description of the type of payment made, the period covered by the payment, the source of the payment, sales amounts upon which the payment is based, the royalty rate, and the unit value. If any State or Indian Tribe needs additional information pertaining to mineral revenue payments, the State or Tribe may request this information from ONRR.

        (b) ONRR will provide these reports to:

        (1) States, not later than the 10th day of the month following the month in which ONRR disburses the State's share of royalties and related monies.

        (2) BIA, on behalf of Tribes and Indian allottees, not later than the 10th day of the month following the month in which ONRR disburses the funds.

        (c) ONRR will not include in these reports revenues that we cannot distribute to States, Tribes, or Indian allottees because the payor/lessee provided incorrect, inadequate, or incomplete information about the proper recipient of the payment, until the payor/lessee has submitted to ONRR the missing information.

        § 1219.105   What definitions apply to this subpart?

        § 1219.410   What does this subpart contain?

#### § § 1219.410

        (a) The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) directs the Secretary of the Interior to disburse a portion of the rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums derived from certain Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively identified as the Gulf producing States); to eligible coastal political subdivisions (CPSs) within those States; and to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Shared GOMESA revenues are reserved for the following purposes:

        (1) Projects and activities for the purpose of coastal protection, including conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses;

        (2) Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources;

        (3) Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan;

        (4) Mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects; and

        (5) Planning assistance and administrative costs not-to-exceed 3 percent of the amounts received.

        (b) This subpart sets forth the formula and methodology ONRR uses to determine the amount of revenues allocated and disbursed to each Gulf producing State and each eligible CPS for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Leasing revenues disbursed under this subpart originate from leases issued on or after December 20, 2006, in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area, subject to restrictions identified in GOMESA. We collectively refer to the revenue sharing from these areas for these fiscal years as GOMESA Phase I revenue sharing. For questions related to the revenue-sharing provisions in this subpart, please contact: Program Manager, Financial Management, Office of Natural Resources Revenue, P.O. Box 25165, Denver Federal Center, Building 85, Denver, CO 80225-0165.

        (vi) Lease revenues explicitly excluded from GOMESA revenue sharing by statute or appropriations law.

        § 1219.412   How will ONRR divide the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I)?

#### § § 1219.412

        For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the Secretary of the Treasury will deposit 50 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) into a special U.S. Treasury account, from which ONRR will disburse 75 percent to the Gulf producing States and 25 percent to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Of the revenues disbursed to a Gulf producing State, we will disburse 20 percent directly to the CPSs within that State. Each Gulf producing State will receive at least 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) available for allocation to the Gulf producing States each fiscal year. The following table summarizes the resulting revenue shares (adding to 100 percent):

        § 1219.413   How will ONRR determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) from leases in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area?

#### § § 1219.413

        (a) ONRR will determine the great circle distance between:

        (1) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase I); and

        (2) The point on the coastline of each Gulf producing State that is closest to the geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase I).

        (b) Based on these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) to disburse to each Gulf producing State as follows:

        (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts (Phase I), the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase I), and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase I). For applicable leased tracts intersected by the planning area administrative boundary line, we will use the geographic center of the entire lease for the inverse distance determination.

        (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase ____I____) calculated under paragraph (1), by the sum of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase I) across all four Gulf producing States. In the formulas below, , , , and  represent the sum of the inverses of the shortest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts (Phase I), respectively. We will multiply the result by the amount of shareable, qualified OCS revenues (Phase I).

        (3) If, in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 10-percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) to any Gulf producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) to the affected State and recalculate the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues (Phase I), omitting from the calculation the State receiving the 10-percent minimum share.

        § 1219.414   How will ONRR allocate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) to coastal political subdivisions within the Gulf producing States?

#### § § 1219.414

        (a) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, ONRR will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's population bears to the population of all CPSs in the State.

        (b) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's miles of coastline bears to the total miles of coastline across all CPSs in the State. However, for the State of Louisiana, we will deem CPSs without a coastline to each have a coastline one-third the average length of the coastline of all CPSs within Louisiana that have a coastline.

        (c)(1) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 50 percent in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between:

        (i) The point in each CPS that is closest to the geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase I); and

        (ii) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase I).

        (2) However, we will exclude distances to an applicable leased tract (Phase I) from this calculation if any portion of the tract is located in a geographic area that was subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 2005, unless the leased tract was in production on that date.

        § 1219.415   How will ONRR allocate qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) to the coastal political subdivisions if, during any fiscal year, there are no applicable leased tracts in the 181 Area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area?

#### § § 1219.415

        If, during any fiscal year, there are no applicable leased tracts in the 181 Area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, ONRR will allocate revenues to the CPSs in accordance with the following criteria:

        (a) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 50 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's population bears to the population of all CPSs in the State.

        (b) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase I) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 50 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's miles of coastline bears to the total miles of coastline across all CPSs within the State. However, for the State of Louisiana, we will deem CPSs without a coastline to each have a coastline one-third the average length of the coastline of all CPSs within Louisiana that have a coastline.

        § 1219.416   When will ONRR disburse funds to Gulf producing States and coastal political subdivisions?

#### § § 1219.416

        ONRR will disburse GOMESA revenues as soon as authorized and practicable within the fiscal year following the year that we collect qualified OCS revenues (Phase I).

      Subpart E—Oil and Gas, Offshore, GOMESA Phase II Revenue Sharing

        § 1219.510   What does this subpart contain?

#### § § 1219.510

        (a) GOMESA directs the Secretary of the Interior to disburse a portion of the rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums derived from certain OCS leases in the GOM to the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively identified as the Gulf producing States); to eligible CPSs within those States; and to the LWCF. GOMESA directs the Gulf producing States and CPSs to use the shared revenues for the following purposes:

        (1) Projects and activities for the purpose of coastal protection, including conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses;

        (2) Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources;

        (3) Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan;

        (4) Mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects; and

        (5) Planning assistance and administrative costs not-to-exceed 3 percent of the amounts received.

        (b) This subpart sets forth the formula and methodology ONRR will use to determine the amount of revenues allocated and disbursed to each Gulf producing State and each eligible CPS for fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter. Leasing revenues disbursed under this subpart (also referred to as GOMESA Phase II) originate from leases issued on or after December 20, 2006, in the 181 Area, the 181 South Area, and the GOM 2002-2007 Planning Area, subject to restrictions and caps identified in GOMESA.

After applying the cap, if applicable, ONRR will disburse 75 percent to the Gulf producing States and 25 percent to the LWCF. Of the revenues disbursed to a Gulf producing State, we will disburse 20 percent directly to the CPSs within that State. Each Gulf producing State will receive at least 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped) available for allocation to the Gulf producing States each fiscal year.

        § 1219.513   How will ONRR determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) from leases in the 181 Area, the 181 South Area, and the 2002-2007 Planning Area?

#### § § 1219.513

        (a) ONRR will determine the great circle distance between:

        (1) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site; and

        (2) The point on the coastline of each Gulf producing State that is closest to the geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site.

        (b) Based on a specific subset of these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—uncapped) to disburse to each Gulf producing State as follows:

        (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area, the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area, and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area.

        (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase ____I____I) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area calculated under paragraph (1), by the sum of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area across all four Gulf producing States. In the formulas below, , , , and  represent the sum of the inverses of the shortest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts (Phase II), respectively. We will multiply the result by the amount of shareable, qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—uncapped).

        (3) If, in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 10-percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—uncapped) to any Gulf producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—uncapped) to the affected State and recalculate the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—uncapped), omitting from the calculation the State receiving the 10-percent minimum share.

        (c) Based on a specific subset of these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped) to disburse to each Gulf producing State as follows:

        (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites, the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites, and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites.

        (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase ____I____I) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites calculated under paragraph (1), by the sum of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites across all four Gulf producing States. In the formulas below, , , , and  represent the sum of the inverses of the shortest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) and historical lease sites, respectively. We will multiply the result by the amount of shareable, qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped).

        (3) If, in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 10-percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped) to any Gulf producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped) to the affected State and recalculate the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues (Phase II—capped), omitting from the calculation the State receiving the 10-percent minimum share.

        § 1219.514   How will ONRR allocate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) to coastal political subdivisions within the Gulf producing States?

#### § § 1219.514

        (a) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, ONRR will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's population bears to the population of all CPSs in the State.

        (b) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's miles of coastline bears to the total miles of coastline across all CPSs in the State. However, for the State of Louisiana, we will deem CPSs without a coastline to each have a coastline one-third the average length of the coastline of all CPSs within Louisiana that have a coastline.

        (c)(1) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 50 percent in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between:

        (i) The point in each CPS that is closest to the geographic center of the applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site; and

        (ii) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site.

        (2) However, we will exclude distances to an applicable leased tract (Phase II) from this calculation if any portion of the tract is located in a geographic area that was subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 2005, unless the leased tract was in production on that date.

        § 1219.515   How will ONRR update the group of “historical lease sites” and “applicable leased tracts (Phase II)” used for determining the allocation of shared revenues?

#### § § 1219.515

        (a) As GOMESA directs, ONRR will update the group of historical lease sites in the 2002-2007 Planning Area as follows:

        (1) On December 31, 2015, we will freeze the group of historical lease sites, subject to the adjustment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2) Beginning January 1, 2022, and every fifth year thereafter, we will extend the ending date for determining the group of historical lease sites for an additional five calendar years by adding any new historical lease sites to the existing group.

        (b) Each year we will update the group of applicable leased tracts (Phase II) to include only leases that were in effect at any time during the previous fiscal year.

        § 1219.516   When will ONRR disburse funds to Gulf producing States and coastal political subdivisions?

#### § § 1219.516

        ONRR will disburse GOMESA revenues as soon as authorized and practicable within the fiscal year following the year that we collect qualified OCS revenues (Phase II).

      (a)  The rent paid by the lessee for the NPSL tract is allowable.

      (b)  (1)(i) Salaries and wages of lessee's field employees, first level supervisors and technical employees employed in the NPSL project area in NPSL operations are allowable if such costs are not charged under paragraph (g) of this section.

      (ii) Salaries and wages of technical employees within technical branches of the lessee's organization who are either temporarily or permanently assigned to, and directly employed in NPSL operations are allowable provided that such employees work “full time” on some particular aspect of NPSL operations or some specific technical problem. Excluded from this category are employees assigned a role in NPSL operations as a duty collateral with other duties that do not directly benefit NPSL operations.

      (iii) Salaries and wages of technical employees within technical branches of the lessee's organization who are assigned technical tasks directly related to NPSL operations may be allowable. Costs may be charged to the NPSL if supported by adequate time records showing the nature of the task and the hours spent on that task.

      (2) Lessee's cost of allowed employee absence paid to employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to NPSL operations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are allowable.

      (3) Expenditures or contributions made pursuant to assessments imposed by governmental authority that are applicable to lessee's costs chargeable to NPSL operations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2) of this section are allowable.

      (4) Reasonable personal expenses, including allowable relocation costs of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to NPSL operations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section and that are paid by the lessee or for which the employees are reimbursed under the lessee's normal practice are allowable except as limited by § 1220.013(g).

      (i) Allowable relocation costs include:

      (A) Travel expenses, including transportation, lodging, subsistence, and reasonable incidental expenses of the employee and members of his immediate family and transportation of his household and personal effects to the new location.

      (B) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as costs of cancelling an unexpired lease, disconnecting and reinstalling household appliances, and purchases of insurance against damages to or loss of personal property are allowable. Costs of cancelling an unexpired lease shall not exceed three times the monthly rental.

      (C) Closing costs (, brokerage fees, legal fees, appraisal fees, etc.) for the sale of the employee's actual residence when notified of the transfer are allowable; and

      (D) Continuing costs of ownership of the vacant former actual residence being sold, such as continuing mortgage principal and interest payments, maintenance of building and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, property insurance, etc., after settlement date of lease or date of new permanent residence are allowable.

      (ii) The combined total of costs listed in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (C) through (D) of this section shall not exceed 8 percent of the sales price of the property sold.

      (iii) Section 1220.013(g) specifies employee relocation expenses that are not allowable as a charge to NPSL operations.

      (5) Lessee's current costs of established plans for employee's group life insurance, hospitalization, pension, retirement, stock purchase, thrift, bonds, and other benefit plans of a like nature that are made available to all of lessee's employees on an equitable basis, applicable to lessee's labor cost chargeable to NPSL operations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2) of this section, are allowable. The amount of these charges shall be lessee's actual cost not to exceed 23 percent of the total charges under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2) except that the Director may from time to time establish a different maximum percentage.

      (6) Charges for expenses incurred under paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section may be made to NPSL accounts on a “when and as paid” basis or by a percentage assessment method. If the percentage assessment method is used, it shall be based upon the lessee's actual cost experience expressed as a percentage of costs chargeable under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2) of this section. Under either method the lessee's own cost of administering the plans and paying the salaries and benefits defined in this paragraph shall be excluded. In determining actual cost experience of an employee benefit plan, any dividend or refunds received that are applicable to insurance or annuity policies shall be used to reduce the cost of such policies.

      (c)  (1) Materiel purchased or furnished by a lessee as NPSL property shall be charged or credited at amounts specified in § 1220.015. The purchase and inventorying of materiel is subject to the conditions and provisions in § 1220.032.

      (3) Credit for salvaged or returned materiel shall be made to the NPSL capital account. When the amount originally charged qualifies for the allowance for capital recovery in § 1220.020, the credit shall be calculated pursuant to § 1220.021(a)(3).

      (d)  Transportation of employees and materiel necessary for NPSL operations to, from, and within the NPSL project area, are allowable, but subject to the following limitations:

      (1) If materiel is moved to the NPSL project area, no charge shall be made to NPSL operations for a distance greater than the distance from the nearest reliable supply store, recognized barge terminal, or railway receiving point where like materiel is normally available, unless agreed to by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) Director.

      (2) If surplus materiel is moved from the NPSL project area, no charge shall be made to NPSL operations for a distance greater than the distance to the nearest reliable supply store, recognized barge terminal, or railway receiving point unless agreed to by the ONRR Director. No charge shall be made to NPSL operations for moving materiel to other properties owned by or under the control of a lessee, unless agreed to by the ONRR Director.

      (3) In the application of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, there shall be no equalization of actual gross trucking costs of $200 or less, excluding accessorial charges.

      (e)  Except when excluded by paragraph (f) of this section and/or § 1220.013(c), the cost of services and utilities provided under contract by outside parties to the lessee and which constitute proper and necessary NPSL operations or support for NPSL operations, and rental charges paid to outside parties for the use of equipment used in the NPSL project area in support of NPSL operations, may be charged to NPSL operations subject to the following conditions and limitations:

      (1) Contract services (including professional consulting services and contract services of technical personnel) that are entirely performed in the NPSL project area and benefit exclusively NPSL operations may be charged at the rates specified in the contract.

      (2) Contract services (including professional consulting services and contract services of technical personnel) that are entirely performed in the NPSL project area and benefit the NPSL operations and operations on other tracts must be allocated among all tracts benefited and only that portion representing services benefiting the NPSL tract charged to NPSL operations.

      (3) Contract services (including professional consulting services and contract services of technical personnel) that are performed at sites outside the NPSL project area may be charged to NPSL operations only if:

      (i) The contracted services charged to the NPSL operations benefit only the NPSL tract or support NPSL operations;

      (ii) The contract under which such services are provided deals exclusively with services benefiting the NPSL tract or NPSL operations, or the costs of the contract services which are applicable to the NPSL tract or NPSL operations are separately and specifically identified in the contract; and

      (iii) Services specified in the contract relate to the resolution of specific technical problems confronting NPSL operations, or specific engineering design problems related to equipment or facilities required for NPSL operations.

      (4) The cost of any contract service related to research and development is specifically excluded, as are contract services calling for feasibility studies not directly related to specific engineering design problems or alternatives for equipment and facilities required by NPSL operations.

      (f)  Expense of handling, investigating and settling litigation or claims, discharging of liens, payments of judgments and amounts paid for settlement of claims incurred in or resulting from NPSL operations, or necessary to protect or recover the NPSL property are allowable, except those costs listed in § 1220.013(f) as unallowable. This includes the salaries and wages of lessee's legal staff and the expense of outside attorneys who are assigned to matters described in this paragraph if supported by adequate time records showing the nature of the matter, its direct relationship to NPSL operations, and the hours spent on the matter.

      (g)  (1)(i) The NPSL capital account shall be charged for the use of equipment and facilities owned by a lessee that are proper and necessary for NPSL operations, including shore base and offshore facilities and pipelines from the tract to shore base production facilities, and that are not NPSL property. Rental charges shall be made at rates based upon actual costs of acquisition, construction, and operation. Such rates may include labor, the cost of setting up and dismantling equipment, maintenance, repairs, other operating expenses, insurance, taxes, depreciation (calculated using a method consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied) and a return on the remaining undepreciated basis not to exceed 8 percent per year, except that the ONRR Director may from time to time establish a different maximum percentage. Any cost of acquiring real property in excess of that reasonably required to support the facilities furnished for NPSL operations shall not be included in the costs used to establish these rates. Rates charged shall not exceed average commercial rates for equipment and facilities of similar nature and capability currently prevailing in the vicinity of the NPSL project area.

      (ii) The term  is used in the broad sense to include equipment that may be mobile or semimobile and also installations that may be semipermanent or permanent in nature. Such equipment and facilities listed below shall be charged on the basis indicated.

      (2) In lieu of charges in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the lessee may elect to use average commercial rates prevailing in the vicinity of the NPSL project area less 20 percent. For automotive equipment, the lessee may elect to use rates established by the ONRR Director. For other equipment for which no commercial rate exists, the lessee shall submit the basis for determining such costs to the ONRR Director for approval.

      (h)  All costs necessary for the repair or replacement of NPSL property made necessary because of damages or losses incurred by fire, flood, storm, theft, accident, or other causes not covered by insurance, except those resulting from lessee's negligence or willful misconduct may be charged to the NPSL capital account. Any settlement received from an insurance carrier should be credited to NPSL operations when received.

      (i)  All taxes, except income taxes, profit share payments, and taxes based upon income, that are assessed or levied upon or in connection with NPSL operations and which have been paid by the lessee are allowable. Allowed taxes shall include, but not be limited to, production, severance, excise, ad valorem, and mineral taxes.

      (j)  (1) Net premiums paid for insurance required to be carried for NPSL operations are allowable. For NPSL operations in which the lessee may act as self-insurer for Workmen's Compensation and Employer's Liability, the lessee may include the risk under its self-insurance program in providing coverage under State and Federal laws and charge NPSL operations at lessee's cost not to exceed manual rates.

      (2) NPSL operations shall be credited for all reimbursements for costs of damage to NPSL property or personal injury. Reimbursements for damaged NPSL property shall be credited as follows:

      (i) If the damaged NPSL property is replaced or repaired, to the NPSL capital account charged for the cost of replacement or repair; or

      (ii) If the damaged NPSL property is not replaced or repaired, to the NPSL capital account except that if the cost of the property originally qualified for the allowance for capital recovery in § 1220.020, the credit shall be calculated pursuant to § 1220.021(a)(3).

      (k)  Costs of leasing, acquiring, installing, operating, repairing and maintaining communication systems, including radio, microwave facilities, and computer production controls for the NPSL operations are allowable. If communication facilities systems serving the NPSL tract serve operations and/or facilities outside the NPSL project area, charges to NPSL operations shall be made as provided in paragraph (g) of this section or shall be allocated to NPSL operations in accordance with § 1220.014.

      (l)  Costs incurred in the NPSL project area as a result of statutory regulations for archeological and geophysical surveys relative to identification and protection of cultural resources and other environmental or ecological surveys required by the Bureau of Land Management or other regulatory authority, may be charged to the NPSL capital account. Also, the costs to provide or have available pollution containment and removal equipment, including payments to organizations and/or funds which provide equipment and/or assistance in the event of oil spills or other environmental damage are allowable. The costs of actual control and cleanup of oil spills and resulting responsibilities required by applicable laws and regulations are allowable, except that a charge shall not be allowed for any such costs attributable to the lessee's negligence or willful misconduct.

      (m)  The costs of dry or bottom hole contributions made to obtain information about the structure or other characteristics of the geology underlying the NPSL tract are allowable.

      (n)  Actual costs incurred in the plugging of wells, dismantling of platforms and other facilities and in the restoration of the NPSL project area shall be charged to the NPSL capital account only when incurred (, not on an accrual basis), except that costs incurred after the cessation of production shall not be charged to the NPSL capital account. Abandonment costs in excess of offsetting revenues shall not form the basis of any claim against the United States.

      (o)  Any other costs not covered in paragraphs (a)-(n) of this section and not disallowed by § 1220.013 that are incurred by the lessee in the necessary and proper conduct of NPSL operation and are approved by the ONRR Director, are allowable. Approval of a plan of development and production for the NPSL tract by the BOEM Director shall be considered sufficient approval for these other costs provided they are separately identified in said plan of development and production. Such separate identification shall note the nature of these other costs and may include an estimate of their magnitude. Any cost approvals under this paragraph for which the specific amounts have not been itemized are presumed to be approved provided they fall within the limits for a prudent operator. Approval of costs under this paragraph shall be approval solely for the purposes of determining allowable costs and shall not preclude a subsequent adjustment at audit of the amount of such costs.

      (p)  Credit shall be given to the NPSL capital account, depending on when it is incurred, for NPSL property leased or used in non-NPSL operations, for the sale of information derived from test wells and G & G, and for any and all amounts earned or otherwise due lessee as a result of NPSL operations.

#### § § 1220.015

      (a)(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, materiel purchased for use in NPSL operations shall be charged to NPSL operations at the price paid, after deduction of any discounts received. Should any purchased materiel be defective or returned to a vendor for other reasons, the credit shall be allocated to NPSL operations when received by the lessee in accordance with § 1220.011(c)(3).

      (2)  An item of materiel, which is acquired by the lessee for use in NPSL operations by means other than purchase or disposed of by any means, shall be priced according to this subparagraph:

      (i)  (A) Tubular goods, except line pipe, shall be priced at the current market price in effect on date of movement on a minimum carload or barge load weight basis, regardless of quantity transferred, equalized to the lowest published price “free on board” (f.o.b.) railway receiving point or recognized barge terminal nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is normally available.

      (B)  () Movement of less than 30,000 pounds shall be priced at the current price in effect at date of movement, as listed by a reliable supply store nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is normally available.

      () Movement of 30,000 pounds or more shall be priced under the provisions for tubular goods pricing in paragraph (a)(_2_)(i)(A) of this section.

      (C) Other materiel shall be priced at the current price in effect at date of movement, as listed by a reliable supply store or f.o.b. railway receiving point nearest the NPSL tract where such materiel is normally available.

      (ii)  Materiel in sound and serviceable condition and suitable for reuse without reconditioning:

      (A) Materiel transferred to the NPSL project area shall be priced at 75 percent of current Condition A price.

      (B) Materiel transferred from the NPSL project area shall be priced:

      () At 75 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition A materiel, or

      () At 65 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition B materiel at 75 percent of current Condition A price.

      (B)  Materiel no longer suitable for its original purposes but suitable for some other purpose shall be priced on a basis commensurate with its use and comparable with that of materiel normally used for such other purpose. If the materiel has no alternative use it should be priced at prevailing prices as scrap.

      (iv)  Materiel that is serviceable and usable for its original function and has a value less than Condition A, B, or C materiel may be valued at a price agreed to by the Director. Such price should be the equivalent of the value of the service rendered by such materiel.

      (b)  (1) Loading and unloading costs shall be charged at a rate of 15 cents per hundred weight, or such other rate as may be set by the ONRR Director, on all tubular goods movements, in lieu of loading/unloading costs sustained, when the actual hauling costs of such tubular goods is equalized under provisions of § 1220.011(d).

      (2) Materiel involving erection costs shall be charged at the applicable percentage of the current knocked-down price of new materiel.

      (c) When materiel subject to paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section is transferred, the cost of reconditioning shall be borne by the receiving party.

      § 1220.020   Calculation of the allowance for capital recovery.

#### § § 1220.020

      (a) For purposes of this section, the cost base for the allowance for capital recovery in a particular month shall consist of the sum of:

      (1) All allowable direct and allocable joint costs chargeable to the NPSL capital account during the month less any costs specified in § 1220.012(c); plus

      (2) The value of contract services chargeable to the NPSL capital account during the month pursuant to § 1220.011(e); plus

      (3) The capital recovery period overhead allowance, calculated in accordance with § 1220.012(a), that is chargeable to the NPSL capital account for the month; less

      (4) Production revenues and other credits received during the month.

      (b) If the cost base for a month is greater than zero (that is, if the sum of the charges specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section exceeds the value of production revenues and other credits), the allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated by multiplying the cost base by the capital recovery factor, and shall be debited to the NPSL capital account as specified in § 1220.021(b).

      (c) If the cost base for a month is less than zero, the allowance for capital recovery for the NPSL capital account shall be calculated by multiplying the resulting negative cost base by the capital recovery factor. The negative product of this calculation shall be debited to the NPSL capital account as specified in § 1220.021(b).

      (d) No allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated on the charges or credits related to any time period after the end of the capital recovery period.

      § 1220.021   Determination of net profit share base.

#### § § 1220.021

      (a) During each month of the lease term, the NPSL capital account shall be:

      (1) Debited with allowable direct and allocable joint costs;

      (2) Credited with an amount reflecting the production revenues for the month, calculated in accordance with § 1260.110(b) of this title.

      (3) Credited with amounts properly credited back to the NPSL capital account as specified in § 1220.011(p). Credits associated with charges to the NPSL capital account during the capital recovery period, however, shall first be increased by the value of the credit multiplied by the recovery factor, before crediting that sum to the NPSL capital account.

      (b) At the end of each month of the lease term during the capital recovery period:

      (1) The transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made to the NPSL capital account.

      (2) The capital recovery period overhead allowance shall be calculated in accordance with § 1220.012(a) and debited to the NPSL capital account.

      (3) The allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated in accordance with § 1220.020 and the allowance debited (or the negative allowance debited, as appropriate) to the NPSL capital account. (A debit entry of a negative allowance for capital recovery shall have the same effect as a credit entry of the absolute value of the allowance for capital recovery.)

      (4) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated. If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL capital account, the capital recovery period will be considered terminated as of this month. The credit balance will be forwarded to the next month, which will be the first month for which a profit share payment is due.

      (c) At the end of each month of the lease term following the end of the capital recovery period:

      (1) The transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made to the NPSL capital account.

      (2) An overhead allowance shall be calculated in accordance with § 1220.012(b) and debited to the NPSL capital account.

      (3) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated.

      (d) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in paragraph (c) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL capital account, this credit balance is the net profit share base for that month. The opening debit and credit balances in the NPSL capital account for any month following a month in which there is a credit balance in the NPSL capital account (except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)) of this section shall be zero.

      (e) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, there is a debit balance in the NPSL capital account, this debit balance shall be the opening debit balance in the NPSL capital account for the following month.

      (f) Any credit balance in the NPSL capital account shall become the net profit share base as described in this section. Any debit balance in the NPSL capital account shall be maintained only insofar as necessary for the determination of profit share payments. Such debit balance shall not represent a claim against the United States.

      (4) The amount and description of all costs of acquisition, construction, and operation of equipment and facilities furnished by the lessee and charged to the NPSL capital account under § 1220.011(g). Such records shall include worksheets or other documents that indicate the method used to calculate the amount of each charge made under § 1220.011(g);

      (5) The cumulative balance of costs and credits to the NPSL capital account; and

      (6) The inventory of materiel.

      (b) The ledger cards showing the charges and credits to the NPSL capital account shall be maintained until thirty-six months after the cessation of NPSL operations by the lessee. All other documents, journals and records shall be maintained for thirty-six months from the due date or date of mailing of the statement of account on an NPSL, whichever comes later, except that nothing in these regulations shall limit the time of investigation or the need to produce records when prima facie evidence of fraud or willful misconduct is obtained with respect to the government's interest in the NPSL.

Such report shall list the costs incurred, including allowances applied, credits received, and the balance of the NPSL capital account. Not later than 60 days after the end of the first month in which production revenues are credited to the NPSL capital account, a final report relating to the period shall be filed.

      (b) Beginning with the first month in which production revenues are credited to the NPSL capital account, each lessee subject to this part 1220 shall file a report for each NPSL, not later than 60 days following the end of each month, containing the following information for the month for which the report is filed:

      (1) The volume and disposition of all oil and gas production saved, removed or sold;

      (2) The production revenue;

      § 1220.032   Inventories.

#### § § 1220.032

      (a) The lessee is responsible for NPSL materiel and shall make proper and timely cost and credit notations for all materiel movements affecting NPSL property. The lessee shall provide only such materiel as may be required for immediate use or is consistent with practical, efficient, and economical operations. The accumulation of surplus stocks shall be avoided by proper materiel control, inventory and purchasing. The lessee shall make timely disposition of idle and surplus materiel through sale.

      (b) At reasonable intervals, but at least once every three years, inventories of controllable materiel shall be taken by the lessee. Written notice of intention to take inventory shall be given by the lessee at least 30 days before any inventory is to be taken so that the BOEM Director may be represented at the taking of inventory. Failure of the BOEM Director to be represented at an inventory shall bind the BOEM Director to accept the inventory taken by the lessee, except in the case of willful misrepresentation or fraud.

      (c) Inventory shall be valued with any generally accepted accounting method used by the lessee to value the same materiel for financial or income tax reporting purposes, provided that the method is consistently applied throughout the life of the materiel.

      (d) Reconciliation shall be made of a physical inventory with the NPSL capital account by the lessee, and a list of overages and shortages shall be available to the BOEM Director for audit as provided in § 1220.033. Inventory adjustments of controllable materiel shall be made by the lessee to the NPSL capital account for overages and shortages. Controllable materiel removed from physical inventory that has not been credited to NPSL operations under § 1220.015(a)(2) shall be credited to NPSL operations at its original value, except that when the cost of the materiel originally qualified for the allowance for capital recovery in § 1220.020, the credit shall be calculated pursuant to § 1220.021(a)(3).

      § 1220.033   Audits.

#### § § 1220.033

      (a) The accounts of an NPSL lessee or of a contractor of the lessee which are related to NPSL operations shall be subject to audit by DOI or its appointed agent. Where possible, the auditor for DOI shall coordinate audit efforts with other nonoperators, if any. DOI shall have the right to initiate an audit any time within thirty-six months of the due date of the monthly statement that is to be audited or the date that the statement was mailed, whichever is later, provided, however, that audits may not be conducted any more frequently than once every year except upon a showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.

      (b)(1) When nonoperators of an NPSL lease call an audit in accordance with the terms of their operating agreement, the ONRR Director shall be notified of the audit call in the same manner as the operator is notified. DOI may elect to send an auditor with the audit team specified by the nonoperators in lieu of calling for a separate audit by DOI.

      (2) If DOI determines to call for an audit, DOI shall notify the lessee of its audit call and set a time and place for the audit. Such a notice shall be sent at least thirty days before the suggested time for the audit to allow the nonoperators to join in DOI's audit in lieu of calling for their own audit. The place for the audit will normally be the place where the lessee maintains its records pertaining to the NPSL lease. The lessee shall send copies of the notice to the nonoperators on the lease. The lessee shall use reasonable effort to notify all nonoperators, but failure to include one or more nonoperators in the notification shall not void the notice.

      (3) When DOI calls for an audit, DOI may suggest the date and time when the audit may commence. The estimated duration of the audit may be mentioned to the lessee as well as to the other nonoperators who may elect to supply and auditor for their own audit purposes. The lessee's office where the audit will be held may be named or, if not known, inquired about. If a visit to a field plant or field office is contemplated by the government auditor, such a field trip may be mentioned. If DOI expresses a desire to review a period on which the thirty-six month time limitation has expired, it is the lessee's prerogative to allow the review or to request that DOI adhere to the time limitation specified in these regulations.

      (c)(1) Exceptions to the accounting by the lessee, whether in favor of the government or the lessee, shall be noted in a report to the lessee. The lessee shall have 60 days from the mailing of a notice of exceptions to agree to the adjustments proposed by the DOI auditor or to object to the proposed adjustments. If the lessee accepts the proposed adjustments, the adjustment shall be booked in the month in which the lessee agrees to the adjustment, except where such adjustment would have resulted in a change in any net profit share payment due the United States. In such a case, there shall be a redetermination of the NPSL capital account pursuant to § 1220.034.

      (2) If the lessee disagrees with the adjustment, the lessee shall have the right to appeal the adjustment to the ONRR Director.

      (d) Upon receipt of an agreement by the government auditor that there are no required audit adjustments, upon final determination with respect to any audit adjustment proposed by the government auditor, or upon the lapse of thirty-six months from the due date or date of mailing of the statement of account on an NPSL lease, whichever comes later, the books shall be closed for audit adjustment purposes, except upon a showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.

      (e) ONRR or its authorized agent may require you to provide records for the audit by one or more of the methods specified in 30 CFR 1217.10.

      § 1220.034   Redetermination and appeals.

#### § § 1220.034

      (a) If, as a result of an inspection of records or an audit under § 1220.033, the ONRR Director determines that there is an error in the NPSL capital account or an error in calculating the net profit share payment, whether in favor of the government or the lessee, the ONRR Director shall redetermine the net profit share base and recalculate the net profit share payment due the United States and notify the lessee of the recalculation.

      (b) The lessee shall pay any additional amount of net profit share payment owed plus interest, compounded monthly, from the date that the payment was due until the date it is actually paid. Interest shall be calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as published in the Bulletin to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, in effect for the period or periods over which the payment is owed.

      (c) If the recalculated profit share payment is less than the amount paid the United States, the lessee shall apply such overpayment to the next profit share payment.

      (d) Within 30 days after receiving notice of the recalculation as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the lessee may appeal the decision of the ONRR Director in accordance with the appeals provision of 30 CFR part 1290.

        § 1227.10   What is the authority for information collection?

#### § § 1227.10

        (a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requirements contained in this part under 44 U.S.C. 3501  The approved OMB control number is identified in 30 CFR 1210.10. We will use the information collected to review and approve delegation proposals from States wishing to perform royalty management functions.

        (b) The Federal Government will reimburse some costs, as provided by statute, for delegated functions that each state performs. However, states could incur additional start-up costs, such as purchasing equipment necessary to perform a delegated function that may not be reimbursable. The ONRR estimates that each payor or reporter will coordinate their interactions and communications among the several states and with ONRR. Send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reducing burden, to the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, Attention: Rules & Regs Team, OMB Control Number 1012-0003, P.O.

        As provided at 30 U.S.C. 1736, 50 percent of any civil penalty collected as a result of activities under a cooperative agreement will be shared with the State or Indian tribe performing the cooperative agreement; however, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be deducted from any Federal funding owed under that cooperative agreement. ONRR shall maintain records of civil penalties collected and distributed to the States and tribes involved in cooperative agreements. Each quarterly payment of the Federal share of a cooperative agreement will be reduced by the amount of the civil penalties paid to the State or tribe during the prior quarter.

          All activities performed by a State under a delegation must be in full accord with all Federal laws, rules and regulations, and Secretarial and agency determinations and orders relating to the calculation, reporting, and payment of oil and gas royalties. In those cases when guidance or interpretations are necessary, the State will direct written requests for such guidance or interpretation to the appropriate ONRR officials. All policy and procedural guidance or interpretation provided by the ONRR shall be in writing and shall be binding on the State.

          (b) The State must maintain in a confidential manner all data obtained from DOI sources or from payor or company sources under the delegation which have been deemed “confidential or proprietary” by DOI or a company or payor. In this regard, the State regulatory authority shall be bound by provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1733. ONRR shall provide to the State guidelines for determining confidential and proprietary material.

          (c) All records subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) must be maintained for a 6-year period measured from the end of the calendar year in which the records were created. All dispositions or records must be with the written approval of the ONRR. Upon termination of a delegation, the State shall, within 90 days from the date of termination, assemble all records specified in subsection (a), complete all working paper files in accordance with § 1229.124, and transfer such records to the ONRR.

          (d) The State shall maintain complete cost records for the delegation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such records shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the total actual costs associated with the project and to permit a determination by ONRR whether delegation funds were used for their intended purpose. All such records shall be made available for review and inspection upon request by representatives of the Secretary and the Department's Office of Inspector General (OGIG).

          § 1229.122   Coordination of audit activities.

#### § § 1229.122

          (a) Each State with a delegation of authority shall submit annually to the ONRR an audit workplan specifically identifying leases, resources, companies, and payors scheduled for audit. This workplan must be submitted 120 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year.

          (b) When a State plans to audit leases of a lessee or royalty payor for which there is an ONRR or OIG resident audit team, all audit activities must be coordinated through the ONRR or OIG resident supervisor. Such activities include, but are not limited to, issuance of engagement letters, arranging for entrance conferences, submission of data requests, scheduling of audit activities including site visits, submission of issue letters, and closeout conferences.

          (c) The State shall consult with the ONRR and/or OIG regarding resolution of any coordination problems encountered during the conduct of delegation activities.

          § 1229.123   Standards for audit activities.

#### § § 1229.123

          (a) All audit activities performed under a delegation of authority must be in accordance with the “Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions” as issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.

          (b) The following audit standards also shall apply to all audit work performed under a delegation of authority.

          (1) —(i)  The auditors assigned to perform the audit must collectively possess adequate professional proficiency for the tasks required, including a knowledge of accounting, auditing, agency regulations, and industry operations.

          (ii)  In all matters relating to the audit work, the audit organization and the individual auditors must be free from personal or external impairments to independence and shall maintain an independent attitude and appearance.

          (iii)  Due professional care is to be used in conducting the audit and in preparing related reports.

          (iv)  The State governments must institute quality control review procedures to ensure that all audits are performed in conformity with the standards established herein.

          (2)  Auditors should be alert to situations or transactions that could be indicative of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts with respect to the program. If such evidence exists, auditors should forward this evidence to ONRR. The ONRR will contact the appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies. The scope of examinations are to be governed by the principle of a justifiable relationship between cost and benefit as determined by the auditor or audit supervisor. Audit procedures should reflect the most efficient method of obtaining the requisite degree of satisfaction. The auditor should determine, to the extent possible, the effect on royalty reporting of the non-arms'-length nature of related party transactions, such as transfers of oil to refinery units affiliated with the producer. A review should be made of compliance with the appropriate laws and regulations applicable to program operations. ONRR shall issue guidelines as to the definition and nature of arms'-length and non-arms'-length transactions for use in carrying out delegated audit activities.

          (3)  (i) Written audit reports are to be submitted to the appropriate ONRR officials at the end of each field examination.

          (ii) A statement in the auditors' report that the examination was made in accordance with the generally accepted program audit standards (including the applicable General Accounting Office (GAO) standards) for royalty compliance audits should be in the appropriate language to indicate that the audit was made in accordance with this statement of standards.

          (iii) The auditor's report should contain a statement of positive assurance on those items tested and negative assurance on those items not tested. It should also include all instances of noncompliance and instances or indications of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts found during or in connection with the audit.

          (iv) The auditor's report should contain any other material deficiency identified during the audit not covered in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

          (v) When factors external to the program and to the auditor restrict the audit or interfere with the auditor's ability to form objective opinions and conclusions (such as denial of access to information by a company), the auditor is to notify the ONRR. If the limitation is not removed, a description of the matter must be included in the auditor's report. ONRR will take all legally enforceable steps necessary to seek information necessary to complete the audit.

          (vi) If certain information is prohibited from general disclosure, the auditor's report should state the nature of the information omitted and the requirement that makes the omission necessary.

          (vii) Written audit reports are to be prepared in the format prescribed by the ONRR.

          (viii) In instances where the extent of the audit findings or the amounts involved do not warrant it, a formal audit report need not be issued. In lieu of an audit report, a memorandum of audit findings will be prepared and placed on the case file.

          § 1229.124   Documentation standards.

#### § § 1229.124

          Every audit performed by a State under a delegation of authority must meet certain documentation standards. In particular, detailed workpapers must be developed and maintained.

          (a)  are defined to include all records obtained or created in performing an audit.

          (b) Each audit performed varies in scope and detail. As a result, the audit team must determine the best presentation of the workpapers for a particular audit. The following general standards of workpaper preparation are consistent with the goal of achieving proper documentation while maintaining sufficient flexibility.

          (1) All relevant information obtained orally must be promptly recorded in writing and incorporated in the workpapers.

          (2) Workpapers must be complete and accurate in order to provide support for findings and conclusions.

          (3) Workpapers should be clear and understandable without the need for supplementary oral explanations. The information they contain must be clear, complete, and concise, so that anyone using the workpapers will be able to readily determine their purpose, the nature and scope of the work done, and the conclusions drawn.

          (4) Workpapers must be legible and as neat as practicable. They must meet standards which allow their use as evidence in judicial and administrative proceedings.

          (5) The information contained in workpapers should be restricted to matters which are materially important and relevant to the objectives established for the assignment.

          (6) Workpapers must be in sufficient detail to permit a subsequent independent execution of each audit procedure, assuming the target company retains its accounting documentation.

          § 1229.125   Preparation and issuance of enforcement documents.

#### § § 1229.125

          (a) Determinations of additional royalties due resulting from audit activities conducted under a delegation of authority must be formally communicated by the State, to the companies or other payors by an issue letter prior to any enforcement action. The issue letter will serve to ensure that all audit findings are accurate and complete by obtaining advance comments from officials of the companies or payors audited. Issue letters must be prepared in a format specified by the ONRR, and transmitted to the company or payor. The company or payor shall be given 30 days from receipt of the letter to respond to the State on the findings contained in the letter.

          (b) After evaluating the company or payor's response to the issue letter, the State shall draft a demand letter which will be submitted with supporting workpaper files to the ONRR for appropriate enforcement action. Any substantive revisions to the demand letter will be discussed with the State prior to issuance of the letter. Copies of all enforcement action documents shall be provided to the State by ONRR upon their issuance to the company or payor.

          § 1229.126   Appeals.

#### § § 1229.126

          (a) Appeals made pursuant to the rules and procedures at 30 CFR parts 1243 and 1290 related to demand letters issued by officers of the ONRR for additional royalties identified under a delegation of authority shall be filed with the ONRR for processing. The State regulatory authority shall, upon the request of the ONRR, provide competent and knowledgeable staff for testimony, as well as any required documentation and analyses, in support of the lessor's position during the appeal process.

          (b) An affected State, upon the request of the ONRR, shall provide expert witnesses from their audit staff for testimony as well as required documentation and analyses to support the Department's position during the litigation of court cases arising from denied appeals. The cost of providing expert witnesses including travel and per diem is reimbursable under the provisions of a delegation of authority, at the Federal Government's existing per diem rates.

          § 1229.127   Reports from States.

#### § § 1229.127

          The State, acting under the authority of the Secretarial delegation, shall submit quarterly reports which will summarize activities carried out by the State during the preceding quarter of the year under the provisions of the delegation. The report shall include:

          (a) A statistical summary of the activities carried out, e.g., number of audits performed, accounts reconciled, and other actions taken;

          (b) A summary of costs incurred during the previous quarter for which the State is seeking reimbursement; and

          (c) A schedule of changes which the State proposes to make from its approved plan.

        (i) Actual knowledge;

        means the Outer Continental Shelf.

        § 1241.5   Which ONRR enforcement actions are subject to a hearing?

#### § § 1241.5

        Except as provided by § 1241.6, you may request a hearing on:

        (a) A NONC to contest your liability.

        (b) A FCCP to contest only the civil penalty amount, unless a request for hearing was filed under paragraph (a) of this section; in which case, the requests for hearing filed under paragraph (a) and this paragraph (b) will be combined into a single proceeding.

        (c) An ILCP to contest your liability, civil penalty amount, or both. If your hearing request does not state whether you are contesting your liability for the ILCP or the penalty amount, or both, you will be deemed to have requested a hearing only on the penalty amount.

        (d) You may request a hearing even if you correct the violation identified in a Notice.

        § 1241.6   Which ONRR enforcement actions are not subject to a hearing?

        You may not request a hearing on:

        (a) Your liability under an order identified in a NONC, FCCP, or ILCP if you did not appeal in a timely manner the order under 30 CFR part 1290 or you appealed in a timely manner the order under 30 CFR part 1290 but have exhausted your appeal rights.

        (b) Any correspondence that we send to you to update you on the amount of penalties accrued or outstanding under a FCCP or ILCP ONRR previously served on you.

        § 1241.7   How do I request a hearing on the record on a Notice?

#### § § 1241.7

        You may request a hearing on the record before an ALJ on a Notice by filing a request within 30 days of the date of service of the Notice with the DCHD, at the address indicated in your Notice. The 30 day-period to request a hearing on the record will not be extended for any reason.

        § 1241.8   How will DCHD conduct the hearing on the record?

#### § § 1241.8

        If you request a hearing on the record under § 1241.7, an ALJ will conduct the hearing under the provisions of 43 CFR 4.420 through 4.438, except when the provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this part. We have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the fact of the violation and the basis for the amount of the civil penalty. Upon completion of the hearing, the ALJ will issue a decision according to the evidence presented and the applicable law.

        § 1241.9   May I appeal the ALJ's decision?

#### § § 1241.9

        If you are adversely affected by the ALJ's decision, you may appeal that decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.

        § 1241.10   May I seek judicial review of the IBLA decision?

#### § § 1241.10

        You may seek judicial review of the IBLA decision under 30 U.S.C. 1719(j) in Federal District Court. You must file a suit for judicial review in Federal District Court within 90 days after the final IBLA decision.

        § 1241.11   Does my hearing request affect a penalty?

#### § § 1241.11

        (a) If you do not correct the violation identified in a Notice, any penalty will continue to accrue, even if you request a hearing, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  If you request in a timely manner a hearing on a Notice, you may petition the DCHD to stay the assessment or accrual of penalties pending the hearing on the record and a decision by the ALJ under § 1241.8.

        (1) You must file your petition for stay within 45 calendar days after you receive a Notice.

        (2) You must file your petition for stay under 43 CFR 4.21(b), in which event:

        (i) We may file a response to your petition within 30 days after service.

        (ii) The 45-day requirement set out in 43 CFR 4.21(b)(4) for the ALJ to grant or deny the petition does not apply.

        (3) If the ALJ determines that a stay is warranted, the ALJ will issue an order granting your petition, subject to your satisfaction of the following condition: within 10 days of your receipt of the order, you must post a bond or other surety instrument using the same standards and requirements as prescribed in 30 CFR part 1243, subpart B; or demonstrate financial solvency using the same standards and requirements as prescribed in 30 CFR part 1243, subpart C, for any specified, unpaid principal amount that is the subject of the Notice, any interest accrued on the principal, and the amount of any penalty set out in a Notice accrued up to the date of the ALJ order conditionally granting your petition.

        (4)(i) If you satisfy the condition to post a bond or surety instrument or demonstrate financial solvency under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the accrual of penalties will be stayed effective on the date of the ALJ's order conditionally granting your petition.

        (ii) If you fail to satisfy the condition to post a bond or surety instrument or demonstrate financial solvency under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, penalties will continue to accrue.

        (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, if the ALJ determines that your defense to a Notice is frivolous, and a civil penalty is owed, you will forfeit the benefit of the stay, and penalties will be calculated as if no stay had been granted.

        Penalties With a Period To Correct

          § 1241.50   What may ONRR do if I violate a statute, regulation, order, or lease term relating to a lease subject to this part?

#### § § 1241.50

          If we determine that you have not followed any requirement of a statute, regulation, order, or a term of a lease subject to this part, we may serve you with a NONC explaining:

          (a) What the violation is.

          (b) How to correct the violation to avoid a civil penalty.

          § 1241.51   What if I correct the violation identified in a NONC?

#### § § 1241.51

          If you correct all of the violations that we identified in the NONC within 20 days after the date on which you are served the NONC, or any longer period for correction that the NONC specifies, we will close the matter and will not assess a civil penalty. However, we will consider these violations as part of your history of noncompliance for future penalty assessments under § 1241.70(a)(2).

          § 1241.52   What if I do not correct the violation identified in a NONC?

#### § § 1241.52

          (a) If you do not correct all of the violations that we identified in the NONC within 20 days after the date on which you are served the NONC, or any longer period that the NONC specifies for correction, then we may send you an FCCP.

          (1) The FCCP will state the amount of the penalty that you must pay. The penalty will:

          (i) Begin to run on the day on which you were served with the NONC.

          (ii) Continue to accrue for each violation identified in the NONC until it is corrected.

          (2) The penalty may be up to $1,562 per day for each violation identified in the NONC that you have not corrected.

          (b) If you do not correct all of the violations identified in the NONC within 40 days after you are served the NONC, or within 20 days following the expiration of any period longer than 20 days that the NONC specifies for correction, then we may increase the penalty to a maximum of $15,628 per day for each violation identified in the NONC that you have not corrected. The increased penalty will:

          (1) Begin to run on the 40th day after the date on which you were served the NONC, or on the 20th day after the expiration of any period longer than 20 days that the NONC specifies for correction.

        (c) We will post the FCCP and ILCP assessment matrices and any adjustments to the matrices on our Web site.

        § 1241.72   When must I pay the penalty?

#### § § 1241.72

        (1) If the amount under appeal is less than $10,000 or does not require payment of a specified amount, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with the order. ONRR will use the lease surety posted with the Bureau of Land Management for onshore leases, and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for OCS leases, as collateral for the obligation; or

        (2) If the amount under appeal is $10,000 or more, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with that order if you:

        (i) Submit an ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B of this part within a time period ONRR prescribes; or

        (ii) Demonstrate financial solvency under subpart C.

        (b)  Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, if you appeal an order regarding the payment and reporting of royalties and other payments due from Indian mineral leases subject to this part, and:

        (1) If the amount under appeal is less than $1,000 or does not require payment, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with the order. ONRR will use the lease surety posted with the Bureau of Indian Affairs as collateral for the obligation; or

        (2) If the amount under appeal is $1,000 or more, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with that order if you submit an ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B of this part within a time period ONRR prescribes.

        (c) Nothing in this part prohibits you from paying any demanded amount or complying with any other requirement pending appeal. However, voluntarily paying any demanded amount or otherwise complying with any other requirement when suspension of an order is otherwise available under these rules does not create judicially reviewable final agency action under 5 U.S.C. 704.

        (d) Regardless of the amount under appeal, ONRR may inform you that it will not suspend your obligation to comply with the order under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section because suspension would harm the interests of the United States or the Indian lessor.

        § 1243.9   Will ONRR continue to suspend my obligation to comply with an order if I seek judicial review in a Federal court?

#### § § 1243.9

        (a) If you seek judicial review of an IBLA decision or other final action of the Department of the Interior regarding an order, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with that order pending judicial review if you continue to meet the requirements of this part.

        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, ONRR may decide that it will not suspend your obligation to comply with an order. ONRR will notify you in writing of that decision and the reasons for it.

        § 1243.10   When will ONRR collect against a bond or other surety instrument or a person demonstrating financial solvency?

#### § § 1243.10

        (a) This section applies to you if, for an appeal of an order under this part, you:

        (1) Maintain a bond or an ONRR-specified surety instrument on your own behalf or for another person; or

        (2) Have demonstrated financial solvency on your own behalf or for another person.

        (b) ONRR may initiate collection against the bond or other surety instrument or the person demonstrating financial solvency:

        (1) If the ONRR Director or the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs decides your appeal adversely to you and you do not pay the amount due or appeal that decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E;

        (2) If the IBLA, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, an Assistant Secretary, or the Secretary decides your appeal adversely to you, and you do not pay the amount due or pursue judicial review within 90 days of the decision;

        (3) If a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final non-appealable decision adverse to you, and you do not pay the amount due within 30 days of the decision;

        (4) If you do not increase the amount of your bond or other surety instrument as required under § 1243.101(b), or otherwise fail to maintain an adequate surety instrument in effect, and you do not pay the amount due under the order within 30 days of notice from ONRR under § 1243.101(b);

        (5) If the obligation to comply with an order or decision is not suspended under § 1243.8 or § 1243.9 and you do not pay the amount required under the order or decision; or

        (6) If the ONRR bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer financially solvent under § 1243.202(c), and you do not pay the order amount or post a bond or other ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B within 30 days of that determination.

        § 1243.11   May I appeal the ONRR bond-approving officer's determination of my surety amount or financial solvency?

#### § § 1243.11

        Any decision on your surety amount under subpart B or your financial solvency under subpart C is final and is not subject to appeal.

        § 1243.12   May I substitute a demonstration of financial solvency for a bond posted before the effective date of this rule?

#### § § 1243.12

        If you appealed an order before June 14, 1999 and you submitted an ONRR-specified surety instrument to suspend compliance with that order, you may replace the surety with a demonstration of financial solvency under this part at an administratively convenient time, such as when the surety instrument is due for renewal.

      Subpart B—Bonding Requirements

        § 1243.100   What standards must my ONRR-specified surety instrument meet?

#### § § 1243.100

        (a) An ONRR-specified surety instrument must be in a form specified in ONRR instructions. ONRR will give you written information and standard forms for ONRR-specified surety instrument requirements.

        (b) ONRR will use a bank-rating service to determine whether a financial institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage.

        (1) Administrative appeal bonds must be issued by a qualified surety company which the Department of the Treasury has approved.

        (2) Irrevocable letters of credit or certificates of deposit must be from a financial institution acceptable to ONRR with a minimum 1-year period of coverage subject to automatic renewal up to 5 years.

        § 1243.101   How will ONRR determine the amount of my bond or other surety instrument?

#### § § 1243.101

        (a) The ONRR bond-approving officer may approve your surety if he or she determines that the amount is adequate to guarantee payment. The amount of your surety may vary depending on the form of the surety and how long the surety is effective.

        (1) The amount of the ONRR-specified surety instrument must include the principal amount owed under the order plus any accrued interest we determine is owed plus projected interest for a 1-year period.

        (2) Treasury book-entry bond or note amounts must be equal to at least 120 percent of the required surety amount.

        (b) If your appeal is not decided within 1 year from the filing date, you must increase the surety amount to cover additional estimated interest for another 1-year period. You must continue to do this annually on the date your appeal was filed. We will determine the additional estimated interest and notify you of the amount so you can amend your surety instrument.

        (c) You may submit a single surety instrument that covers multiple appeals. You may change the instrument to add new amounts under appeal or remove amounts that have been adjudicated in your favor or that you have paid if you:

        (1) Amend the single surety instrument annually on the date you filed your first appeal; and

        (2) Submit a separate surety instrument for new amounts under appeal until you amend the instrument to cover the new appeals.

      Subpart C—Financial Solvency Requirements

        § 1243.200   How do I demonstrate financial solvency?

#### § § 1243.200

        (a) To demonstrate financial solvency under this part, you must submit an audited consolidated balance sheet, and, if requested by the ONRR bond-approving officer, up to 3 years of tax returns to the ONRR, Debt Collection Section using:

        (1) The U.S. Postal Service or private delivery at Office of Natural Resources Revenue, Office of Enforcement, P.O. Box 25165, MS 642000B, Denver, Colorado 80225-0165; or

        (2) Courier or overnight delivery at Office of Natural Resources Revenue, MS 642000B, Room A322, Bldg 85, DFC, Denver, Colorado 80225-0165.

        (b) You must submit an audited consolidated balance sheet annually, and, if requested, additional annual tax returns on the date ONRR first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency as long as you have active appeals, or whenever ONRR requests.

        (c) If you demonstrate financial solvency in the current calendar year, you are not required to redemonstrate financial solvency for new appeals of orders during that calendar year unless you file for protection under any provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code), or ONRR notifies you that you must redemonstrate financial solvency.

        § 1243.201   How will ONRR determine if I am financially solvent?

#### § § 1243.201

        (a) The ONRR bond-approving officer will determine your financial solvency by examining your total net worth, including, as appropriate, the net worth of your affiliated entities.

        (b) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under subpart B for all orders you have appealed is greater than $300 million, you are presumptively deemed financially solvent, and we will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument.

        (c) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under subpart B for all orders you have appealed is less than $300 million, you must submit the following to the ONRR Debt Collection Section by one of the methods in § 1243.200(a):

        (1) A written request asking us to consult a business-information, or credit-reporting service or program to determine your financial solvency; and

        (2) A nonrefundable $50 processing fee:

        (i) You must pay the processing fee to us following the requirements for making payments found in 30 CFR 1218.51. You are not required to use Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for these payments;

        (ii) You must submit the fee with your request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and then annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency, as long as you are not able to demonstrate financial solvency under paragraph (a) of this section and you have active appeals.

        (d) If you request that we consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under paragraph (c) of this section:

        (1) We will use criteria similar to that which a potential creditor would use to lend an amount equal to the bond or other surety instrument we would require under subpart B;

        (2) For us to consider you financially solvent, the business-information or credit-reporting service or program must demonstrate your degree of risk as low to moderate:

        (i) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information demonstrates your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under subpart B;

        (ii) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information does not demonstrate your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under subpart B or pay the obligation.

        § 1243.202   When will ONRR monitor my financial solvency?

#### § § 1243.202

        (a) If you are presumptively financially solvent under § 1243.201(b), ONRR will determine your net worth as described under §§ 1243.201(b) and (c) to evaluate your financial solvency at least annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.

        (b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under § 1243.201(c), we will consult a service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.

        (c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer financially solvent, you must post a bond or other ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B.
