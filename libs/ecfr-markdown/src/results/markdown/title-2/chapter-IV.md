#### § § 400.0

    The definitions in this part are for terms used in this chapter, and to define for USDA terms present in 2 CFR Subtitle A but not defined in that subtitle. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes, regulations, or other sources that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities. Where parts of this chapter provide alternate definitions than those in this part, those definitions take precedence over any definition in this part. For terms used in this chapter that are not defined in this part, the definitions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. All terms not otherwise defined will use the dictionary definition.

    means a product containing visual imagery or sound or both. Examples of audiovisuals are motion pictures, live or prerecorded radio or television programs, slide shows, filmstrips, audio recordings, and multimedia presentations.

    means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate financial assistance awards and make related determinations and findings.

    means construction, alteration, or repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, structures, or other real property. For purposes of this definition, the terms “buildings, structures, or other real property” include, but are not limited to, improvements of all types, such as bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, cemeteries, pumping stations, railways, airport facilities, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, canals, and channels. For the purposes of 2 CFR part 184, construction also encompasses structures, facilities, and equipment incorporated into an infrastructure project regardless of whether they constitute real property.

    means the U.S. _Department_ of Agriculture.

    means an award in which the Federal awarding agency, in keeping with specific statutory authority that enables the agency to exercise judgment (“discretion”), selects the recipient and/or the amount of Federal funding awarded through a competitive process or based on merit of proposals. A discretionary award may be selected by a USDA awarding agency on a non-competitive basis exclusively under the conditions set forth at 2 CFR 415.1.

    means those materials which have been submitted by a recipient for consideration for an award of Federal financial assistance and have been determined to comply with the minimum documentation and other requirements, which may be identified in respective notices of funding opportunities and applicable Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities.

    means the transfer of anything of value by a USDA awarding agency through a Federal financial assistance instrument as defined at 2 CFR part 200.1, inclusive of Federally funded subawards and subcontracts under such instruments, to a recipient. Such support may be provided as a cash or in-kind contribution.

    means information that is tied to a location on the Earth, including by identifying the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth, and that is generally represented in vector datasets by points, lines, polygons, or other complex geographic features or phenomena; may be derived from, among other things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies; includes images and raster datasets, aerial photographs, and other forms of geospatial data or datasets in digitized or non-digitized form.

    means any communication or representation of knowledge, such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms.

    means any recorded information, regardless of physical form or characteristics, disseminated to the public.

    means those activities conducted for the repair or upkeep of buildings, structures, facilities, and equipment which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition.

    means any steps that lead to a finished audiovisual, including but not limited to design, layout, script-writing, filming, editing, fabrication, sound recording or taping. The term does not include the placing of captions to make accessible films or videotapes not originally produced for use by individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing.

    means the _Secretary_ of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    means the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    means any component agency or staff office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture which provides any Federal financial assistance to or executes a Federal financial assistance instrument with a recipient.

    § 400.1   Applicability.

#### § § 400.1

    This part adopts the OMB guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this chapter, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the USDA to the OMB guidance, as supplemented by this chapter.

    § 400.2   Conflict of interest.

#### § § 400.2

    (a) Each USDA awarding agency must establish conflict of interest policies for its Federal financial assistance actions. Each USDA awarding agency employee must comply with the requirements set forth at 5 CFR part 2635, as well as 5 CFR part 8301 where applicable, when the USDA employee takes any action related to Federal financial assistance.

    (b) Recipients must disclose in writing any potential conflicts of interest to the USDA awarding agency or pass-through entity.

    (1) Recipients must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of their employees in the selection, award and administration of Federal awards. No employee, officer or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from an entity considered for a Federal award. The recipient may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

    (2) If the recipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of the relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the recipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a Federal award action involving a related organization.

    (3) Recipients must establish internal controls that include, at a minimum, procedures to identify, disclose, and mitigate or eliminate identified conflicts of interest. Recipients are responsible for notifying the respective USDA awarding agency in writing of any conflicts of interest that may arise during the period of performance of an award, including those which have been reported by subrecipients, no later than 5 calendar days following discovery. Upon receipt of such a disclosure, the respective USDA awarding agency must review and make a determination in writing if a potential or real conflict of interest exists and develop a plan for addressing or mitigating the issue, which may include remedies found at 2 CFR 200.339. USDA awarding agencies must make a determination within 30 calendar days of disclosure unless a longer period of time is necessary due to the complexity of the situation.

    Subpart A—Application for Federal Assistance

      § 415.1   Administrative standards for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements.

#### § § 415.1

      (a) All USDA awarding agencies must demonstrate a commitment to encouraging free and open competition in all discretionary grant and cooperative agreement funding opportunities. USDA awarding agencies must ensure that all eligible applications for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements receive fair and impartial review, be evaluated only on criteria as stated in the respective notice of funding opportunity, and that no applicant receive an unfair advantage.

      (b) USDA awarding agencies must enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by USDA awarding agencies where expressly provided by statute, when directed by Congress, where the requirement is determined to be inconsistent with international assistance objectives of USDA, or as specified in paragraph (d) of this section or as approved by the Secretary and OMB under paragraph (e). A USDA awarding agency's competitive award process must adhere to the following standards:

      (1) All notices of funding opportunities for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements must be published on  as described in 2 CFR 200.204(a). When notices of funding opportunities contain an information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 ) or its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320, USDA awarding agencies must seek and obtain OMB approval before collecting information from the public.

      (i) Supplementary to the requirements at paragraph (b)(1), USDA awarding agencies may make use of other methods of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities. In doing so, USDA awarding agencies must:

      (A) Pursue the broadest dissemination of information concerning notices of funding opportunities in order to reach the greatest number and diversity of potential applicants.

      (B) Avoid any appearance that an unfair advantage has been provided to any entity, inclusive of the memberships or networks of such entities, which may arise from the use of any dissemination method.

      (C) Provide only public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.

      (D) Seek the greatest cost savings to the Government, whenever possible.

      (ii) Nothing in this part will be interpreted as to limit, impede, or otherwise prevent the attendance of any USDA awarding agency's staff, acting in their official capacity, at a conference, event, or similar activity, for the purposes of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.

      (2) Applications must be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with evaluation criteria set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency. USDA awarding agencies must establish written procedures to gain reasonable assurance that individuals selected to serve as independent reviewers are qualified to conduct any assigned review activity and that applications are scored by independent reviewers solely on the basis of criteria announced in the respective published notice of funding opportunity. Independent reviewers must make written comments or make a written determination of scoring, as appropriate, concerning each application to which they are assigned.

      (i) Independent reviewers may be from the private or public sector, including another Federal agency, or within the awarding agency. Independent reviewers must not be any individual who holds or has been delegated approval or award authority for the applications being reviewed or components thereof.

      (ii) Anyone who has or might appear to have a conflict of interest with any element of an application considered for selection or funding will be ineligible to serve as an independent reviewer. A conflict of interest might arise when the prospective independent reviewer, the reviewer's immediate family members, or the reviewer's partner, have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial or other interest in or tangible personal benefit from the applicant or applicant organizations; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment.

      (3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), unless directed by Congress or authorized by statute, USDA awarding agencies may, but are not required to, review, evaluate for eligibility, or otherwise consider for funding any unsolicited application, proposal materials, ideas, pitches, or any other request for Federal funds provided by any entity for the purpose of obtaining Federal financial assistance.

      (c) The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding official in each USDA awarding agency. The awarding official must consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the respective independent reviewers, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the awarding decision must be handled by the awarding agency using existing, written agency appeal procedures.

      (d) The awarding official may make a determination that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination must be made in writing on a case-by-case basis and be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of USDA. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards are:

      (1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services.

      (2) Awards of less than $100,000.

      (3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award for which competition for continued support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.

      (4) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare, or national security requirement preclude competition.

      (e) USDA awarding agencies may establish alternate exceptions from competition for discretionary awards. All such alternative exceptions will be subject to review and approval both by the Secretary and by OMB, pursuant to pursuant to 2 CFR 200.102, and 2 CFR 200.107 when applicable, and publicly set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency.

      (f) All actions taken USDA awarding agencies for the purpose of accomplishing any element of Federal financial assistance programs, awards, and any related or subsequent transactions, must comply with the direction set forth in Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01 and successor policy regarding the performance of inherently governmental and critical functions.

    Subpart B—Miscellaneous

      § 415.2   Acknowledgement of USDA support on information dissemination products.

#### § § 415.2

      Recipients must have an acknowledgement of USDA awarding agency support placed on any information dissemination products produced with any Federal financial assistance support, including those which report the results or, or describe, a Federal financial assistance-supported activity.

      (a) Unless the provisions of the Federal financial assistance award make it apply, this requirement does not apply to:

      (1) Audiovisuals produced as research instruments or for documenting experimentation or findings and not intended for presentation or distribution to the public.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) USDA awarding agencies must require award terms and conditions imposed for the specific purpose of complying with law, regulation, or USDA policy, related to the acknowledgement of USDA awarding agency Federal financial assistance support.

      (c)  A cause for suspension or debarment under 2 CFR 180.700 or 2 CFR 180.800 may be based on the actions of a person with respect to a procurement or nonprocurement transaction under a USDA program even if such transaction has been excluded from covered transaction status by this section or § 417.220.

      § 417.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

#### § § 417.220

      In addition to the procurement contracts listed in 2 CFR 180.220, the following procurement contracts are covered transactions:

      (a) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

      (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction covered under § 417.210, and the contract amount is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in 2 CFR 180.220(a) and 2 CFR 180.220(b) and paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA export credit guarantee program or direct credit program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in 2 CFR 180.220(a) and 2 CFR 180.220(b) and paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d) Notwithstanding the fact that procurement contracts to be implemented outside the United States that are below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program, export credit guarantee program or direct credit program are not covered transactions, pursuant to paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, primary tier participants under these programs must check  prior to entering into any procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with a person at the first lower tier and must not enter into such a procurement contract if the person is excluded or disqualified in .

      § 417.221   How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's foreign assistance programs apply?

#### § § 417.221

      The primary tier covered transaction would be the food aid grant agreement entered into between USDA and a program participant, such as a U.S. private voluntary organization. USDA would have to check  before entering into the food aid grant agreement to ensure that the U.S. private voluntary organization that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a subrecipient agreement between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign subrecipient of the commodities that were provided under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(8), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract entered into between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign entity to provide supplies or services that are expected to equal or exceed $25,000 in value and that are needed by such organization to implement activities under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(b), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. private voluntary organization would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with a subrecipient or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears in  as excluded or disqualified.

      § 417.222   How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's export credit guarantee and direct credit programs apply?

#### § § 417.222

      (a)  In the case of the export credit guarantee program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the guarantee issued by the USDA to a U.S. exporter. The U.S. exporter usually assigns the guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, and this would create another primary tier covered transaction between USDA and the U.S. financial institution. USDA would have to check the  before issuing a guarantee or accepting a guarantee assignment to ensure that the U.S. exporter or financial institution that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank to the U.S. exporter to pay on behalf of the importer for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the guarantee. Similarly, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank under an instrument, such as a loan agreement or letter of credit, to the U.S. financial institution assigned the guarantee, which has paid the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities and, in so doing, issued a loan to the foreign bank, which the foreign bank is obligated to repay on deferred payment terms. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), these nonprocurement transactions would not be covered transactions. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a procurement contract ( a contract for the purchase and sale of goods) that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the guarantee. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. exporter or U.S. financial institution would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or foreign bank or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the  as excluded or disqualified.

      (b)  In the case of the direct credit program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the financing agreement between the USDA and the U.S. exporter. USDA purchases the exporter's account receivable in a particular transaction pursuant to the financing agreement. On occasion, such a transaction may contemplate a payment obligation of a U.S. or foreign bank to make the required payments. USDA would have to check  before entering into a financing agreement or accepting such a payor to ensure that the U.S. exporter or the bank, if any, that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of the importer to pay the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. exporter would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or bank, or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears in  as excluded or disqualified.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 418.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 418.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” will be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 418.210   Reporting.

#### § § 418.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 418.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 418.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100(a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 418.110(a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, will not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” will be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 418.400   Penalties.

#### § § 418.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein will be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (in the OMB-approved format) to be filed or amended if required herein, will be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency will consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section will be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons will be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 418.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 418.405

      Agencies must impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804 through 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

      § 418.410   Enforcement.

#### § § 418.410

      The head of each agency must take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.

    Subpart E—Exemptions

      § 418.500   Secretary of Defense.

#### § § 418.500

      (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary must transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    § 422.2   Procedures.

#### § § 422.2

    Research institutions that conduct extramural research funded by USDA must foster an atmosphere conducive to research integrity. They must develop or have procedures in place to respond to allegations of research misconduct that ensure:

    (a) Appropriate separations of responsibility for inquiry, investigation, and adjudication;

    (b) Objectivity;

    (c) Due process;

    (d) Whistleblower protection;

    (e) Confidentiality—to the extent possible and consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subjects and complainants is limited to those who need to know; and

    (f) Timely resolution.

    § 422.3   Inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

#### § § 422.3

    A research institution that conducts extramural research funded by USDA bears primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct allegations reported directly to it. The research institution must perform an inquiry in response to an allegation, and must follow the inquiry with an investigation if the inquiry determines that the allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance. The responsibilities for adjudication must be separate from those for inquiry and investigation. In most instances, USDA will rely on a research institution conducting extramural research to promptly:

    (a) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged research misconduct;

    (b) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted;

    (c) Acquire, prepare, and maintain appropriate records of allegations of extramural research misconduct and all related inquiries, investigations, and findings; and

    (d) Take action to ensure the following:

    (1) The integrity of research;

    (2) The rights and interests of the subject of the investigation and the public are protected;

    (3) The observance of legal requirements or responsibilities including cooperation with criminal investigations; and

    (4) Appropriate safeguards for subjects of allegations, as well as complainants (see § 422.6). These safeguards should include timely written notification of subjects regarding substantive allegations made against them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access to the data and other evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to respond to allegations, the supporting evidence and the proposed findings of research misconduct, if any.

    § 422.4   USDA Panel to determine appropriateness of research misconduct policy.

#### § § 422.4

    Before USDA will rely on a research institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of an allegation in accordance with this part, the research institution where the research misconduct is alleged must provide the ARIO its policies and procedures related to research misconduct at the institution. The research institution has the option of providing either a written copy of such policies and procedures or a website address where such policies and procedures can be accessed. The ARIO to whom the policies and procedures were made available must convene a panel comprised of the USDA RIO and ARIOs from the Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Panel will review the research institution's policies and procedures for compliance with the OSTP Policy and render a decision regarding the research institution's ability to adequately resolve research misconduct allegations. The ARIO will inform the research institution of the Panel's determination that its inquiry, investigation, and adjudication procedures are sufficient. If the Panel determines that the research institution does not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to conduct inquiry, investigation, and adjudication proceedings, or that the research institution is in any way unfit or unprepared to handle the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication in a prompt, unbiased, fair, and independent manner, the ARIO will inform the research institution in writing of the Panel's decision. An appropriate USDA agency, as determined by the Panel, will then conduct the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct in accordance with this part. If an allegation of research misconduct is made regarding extramural research conducted at a Federal research institution (whether USDA or not), it is presumed that the Federal research institution has research misconduct procedures consistent with the OSTP Policy. USDA reserves the right to convene the Panel to assess the sufficiency of a Federal agency's research misconduct procedures, should there be any question whether the agency's procedures will ensure a fair, unbiased, equitable, and independent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication process.

    § 422.5   Reservation of right to conduct subsequent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

#### § § 422.5

    (a) USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation. This may be necessary if the USDA RIO or ARIO believes, using sound discretion, that despite the Panel's finding that the research institution in question had appropriate and OSTP-compliant research misconduct procedures in place, the research institution conducting the extramural research at issue:

    (1) Did not adhere to its own research misconduct procedures;

    (2) Did not conduct research misconduct proceedings in a fair, unbiased, or independent manner; or

    (3) Has not completed research misconduct inquiry, investigation, or adjudication in a timely manner.

    (b) Additionally, USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation for any other reason that the USDA RIO or ARIO considers it appropriate to conduct research misconduct proceedings in lieu of the research institution's conducting the extramural research at issue. This right is subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

    (c) In cases where the USDA RIO or ARIO believes it is necessary for USDA to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation, the USDA RIO or ARIO will reconvene the Panel, which will determine whether it is appropriate for the relevant USDA agency to conduct the research misconduct proceedings related to the allegation(s) of research misconduct. If the Panel determines that it is appropriate for a USDA agency to conduct the proceedings, the ARIO will immediately notify the research institution in question. The research institution must then promptly provide the relevant USDA agency with documentation of the research misconduct proceedings the research institution has conducted to that point, and the USDA agency will conduct research misconduct proceedings in accordance with the Agency research misconduct procedures.

    § 422.6   Notification of USDA of allegations of research misconduct.

#### § § 422.6

    (a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify OIG and the USDA RIO of all allegations of research misconduct or violations of Federal criminal statutes involving USDA funds when the institution inquiry into the allegation warrants the institution moving on to an investigation.

    (b) Individuals at research institutions who suspect research misconduct at the institution should report allegations in accordance with the institution's research misconduct policies and procedures. Anyone else who suspects that researchers or research institutions performing Federally funded research may have engaged in research misconduct is encouraged to make a formal allegation of research misconduct to OIG.

    (1) OIG has established a hotline for USDA employees and the general public to report fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in USDA programs including allegations of research misconduct. Complaints, which may be submitted anonymously, must be filed with the OIG by submitting a complaint via the hotline on OIG's public website, sending a fax, or writing a letter.

    (i) The OIG hotline may be accessed at

    (ii) Complainants who submit to the hotline on OIG's public website and who wish to provide additional documentation may fax them to (202) 690-2474.

    (iii) Letters may be mailed to: United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, P.O. Box 23399, Washington, DC 20026-3399.

    (2) The USDA RIO may be reached at: USDA Research Integrity Officer, 214W Whitten Building, Washington, DC 20250. Telephone: (202) 690-0745. Email:

    (c) To the extent known, the following details should be included in any formal allegation:

    (1) The name of the research projects involved, the nature of the alleged misconduct, and the names of the individual or individuals alleged to be involved in the misconduct;

    (2) The source or sources of funding for the research project or research projects involved in the alleged misconduct;

    (3) Important dates;

    (4) Any documentation that bears upon the allegation; and

    (5) Any other potentially relevant information.

    (d) Safeguards for complainants give individuals the confidence that they can bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of appropriate authorities or serve as complainants to an inquiry or an investigation without suffering retribution. Safeguards include protection against retaliation for complainants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective procedures for the examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct, and diligence in protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make allegations of research misconduct in good faith. The identity of complainants who wish to remain anonymous will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law or regulation.

    § 422.7   Notification of ARIO during an inquiry or investigation.

#### § § 422.7

    (a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify the ARIO should the institution become aware during an inquiry or investigation that:

    (1) Public health or safety is at risk;

    (2) The resources, reputation, or other interests of USDA are in need of protection;

    (3) Research activities should be suspended;

    (4) Federal action may be needed to protect the interest of a subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected;

    (5) A premature public disclosure of the inquiry into or investigation of the allegation may compromise the process;

    (6) The scientific community or the public should be informed; or

    (7) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.

    (b) If research misconduct proceedings reveal behavior that may be criminal in nature at any point during the proceedings, the institution must promptly notify the ARIO.

    § 422.8   Communication of research misconduct policies and procedures.

#### § § 422.8

    Institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research are to maintain and effectively communicate to their staff policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the guidelines in this part. The institution is to inform their researchers and staff members who conduct USDA-funded extramural research when and under what circumstances USDA is to be notified of allegations of research misconduct, and when and under what circumstances USDA is to be updated on research misconduct proceedings.

    § 422.9   Documents required.

#### § § 422.9

    (a) A research institution that conducts USDA-funded extramural research must maintain the following documents related to an allegation of research misconduct at the research institution:

    (1) A written statement describing the original allegation;

    (2) A copy of the formal notification presented to the subject of the allegation;

    (3) A written report describing the inquiry stage and its outcome including copies of all supporting documentation;

    (4) A description of the methods and procedures used to gather and evaluate information pertinent to the alleged misconduct during inquiry and investigation stages;

    (5) A written report of the investigation, including the evidentiary record and supporting documentation;

    (6) A written statement of the findings; and

    (7) If applicable, a statement of recommended corrective actions, and any response to such a statement by the subject of the original allegation, and/or other interested parties, including any corrective action plan.

    (b) The research institution must retain the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section for at least 3 years following the final adjudication of the alleged research misconduct.

    § 422.10   Reporting to USDA.

#### § § 422.10

    Following completion of an investigation into allegations of research misconduct, the institution conducting extramural research must provide to the ARIO a copy of the evidentiary record, the report of the investigation, recommendations made to the institution's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's determination, the institution's corrective action taken or planned, and the written response of the individual who is the subject of the allegation to any recommendations.

    § 422.11   Research records and evidence.

#### § § 422.11

    (a) A research institution that conducts extramural research supported by USDA funds, as the responsible legal entity for the USDA-supported research, has a continuing obligation to create and maintain adequate records (including documents and other evidentiary matter) as may be required by any subsequent inquiry, investigation, finding, adjudication, or other proceeding.

    (b) Whenever an investigation is initiated, the research institution must promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all relevant research records and evidence as may be necessary to conduct the research misconduct proceedings. This must be accomplished before the research institution notifies the researcher/respondent of the allegation, or immediately thereafter.

    (c) The original research records and evidence taken into custody by the research institution must be inventoried and stored in a secure place and manner. Research records involving raw data must include the devices or instruments on which they reside. However, if deemed appropriate by the research institution or investigator, research data or records that reside on or in instruments or devices may be copied and removed from those instruments or devices as long as the copies are complete, accurate, and have substantially equivalent evidentiary value as the data or records have when the data or records reside on the instruments or devices. Such copies of data or records must be made by a disinterested, qualified technician and not by the subject of the original allegation or other interested parties. When the relevant data or records have been removed from the devices or instruments, the instruments or devices need not be maintained as evidence.

    § 422.12   Remedies for noncompliance.

#### § § 422.12

    USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the administrative actions available to remedy a finding of research misconduct. Such actions may include the recovery of funds, correction of the research record, debarment of the researcher(s) that engaged in the research misconduct, proper attribution, or any other action deemed appropriate to remedy the instance(s) of research misconduct. The agency should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowingly conducted, intentional, or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or had significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare. In determining the appropriate administrative action, the appropriate agency must impose a remedy that is commensurate with the infraction as described in the finding of research misconduct.

    § 422.13   Appeals.

#### § § 422.13

    (a) If USDA relied on an institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication, the alleged person(s) should first follow the institution's appeal policy and procedures.

    (b) USDA agencies' implementation procedures, which must be made available on a designated USDA public website, identify the appeal process when a finding of research misconduct is elevated to the agency.

    § 422.14   Relationship to other requirements.

#### § § 422.14

    Some of the research covered by this part also may be subject to regulations of other governmental agencies ( a university that receives funding from a USDA agency and also under a grant from another Federal agency). If more than one agency of the Federal Government has jurisdiction, USDA will cooperate with the other agency(ies) in designating a lead agency. When USDA is not the lead agency, it will rely on the lead agency following its policies and procedures in determining whether there is a finding of research misconduct. Further, USDA may, in consultation with the lead agency, take action to protect the health and safety of the public, to promote the integrity of the USDA-supported research and research process, or to conserve public funds. When appropriate, USDA will seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.
