If your discount practices vary by model or product line, the discount information should be by model or product line as appropriate.

Destination, Within Consignee's Premises” in accordance with FAR 52.247-35, which is then incorporated by reference, with the exception that an additional charge as provided herein is allowed for such services. Unless otherwise stipulated by the Offeror, the additional charges awarded hereunder may be applied to any delivery within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia.\n",
