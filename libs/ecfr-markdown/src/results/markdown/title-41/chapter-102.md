      Subpart A—Regulation System

        General

          § 102-2.5   What is the Federal Management Regulation (FMR)?

#### § § 102-2.5

          The Federal Management Regulation (FMR) is the successor regulation to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR). It contains updated regulatory policies originally found in the FPMR. However, it does not contain FPMR material that described how to do business with the General Services Administration (GSA). “How to” materials on this and other subjects are available in customer service guides, handbooks, brochures and Internet websites provided by GSA. (See § 102-2.125.)

          § 102-2.10   What is the FMR's purpose?

#### § § 102-2.10

          The FMR prescribes policies concerning property management and related administrative activities. GSA issues the FMR to carry out the Administrator of General Services' functional responsibilities, as established by statutes, Executive orders, Presidential memoranda, Circulars and bulletins issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other policy directives.

          § 102-2.15   What is the authority for the FMR system?

#### § § 102-2.15

          The Administrator of General Services prescribes and issues the FMR under the authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), as well as other applicable Federal laws and authorities.

          § 102-2.20   Which agencies are subject to the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.20

          The FMR applies to executive agencies unless otherwise extended to Federal agencies in various parts of this chapter. The difference between the two terms is that Federal agencies include executive agencies plus establishments in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government. See paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for the definitions of each term.

          (a)  An executive agency is any executive department or independent establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including any wholly-owned Government corporation. (See 40 U.S.C. 472(a).)

          (b)  A Federal agency is any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under that person's direction). (See 40 U.S.C. 472(b).)

          § 102-2.25   When are other agencies involved in developing the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.25

          Normally, GSA will ask agencies to collaborate in developing parts of the FMR.

          § 102-2.30   Where and in what formats is the FMR published?

#### § § 102-2.30

          Proposed rules are published in the  FMR bulletins are published in looseleaf format. FMR interim and final rules are published in the following formats—

          (a)  under the “Rules and Regulations” section.

          (b) Loose-leaf. (See § 102-2.35.)

          (c) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is an annual codification of the general and permanent rules published in the  The CFR is available on line and in a bound-volume format.

          (d) Electronically on the Internet.

          § 102-2.35   How is the FMR distributed?

#### § § 102-2.35

          (a) A liaison appointed by each agency provides GSA with their agency's distribution requirements of the looseleaf version of the FMR. Agencies must submit GSA Form 2053, Agency Consolidated Requirements for GSA Regulations and Other External Issuances, to—General Services Administration, Office of Communications (X), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

          (b) Order  and Code of Federal Regulations copies of FMR material through your agency's authorizing officer.

          § 102-2.40   May an agency issue implementing and supplementing regulations for the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.40

          Yes, an agency may issue implementing regulations (see § 102-2.50) to expand upon related FMR material and supplementing regulations (see § 102-2.55) to address subject material not covered in the FMR. The Office of the Federal Register assigns chapters in Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations for agency publication of implementing and supplementing regulations.

        Numbering

          § 102-2.45   How is the FMR numbered?

#### § § 102-2.45

          (a) All FMR sections are designated by three numbers. The following example illustrates the chapter (it's always 102), part, and section designations:

          (b) In the looseleaf version, the month, year, and number of FMR amendments appear at the bottom of each page.

          § 102-2.50   How do I number my agency's implementing regulations?

#### § § 102-2.50

          The first three-digit number represents the chapter number assigned to your agency in Title 41 of the CFR. The part and section numbers correspond to FMR material. For example, if your agency is assigned Chapter 130 in Title 41 of the CFR and you are implementing § 102-2.60 of the FMR, your implementing section would be numbered § 130-2.60.

          § 102-2.55   How do I number my agency's supplementing regulations?

#### § § 102-2.55

          Since there is no corresponding FMR material, number the supplementing material “601” or higher. For example, your agency's supplementing regulations governing special services to states might start with § 130-601.5.

        Deviations

          § 102-2.60   What is a deviation from the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.60

          A deviation from the FMR is an agency action or policy that is inconsistent with the regulation. (The deviation policy for the FPMR is in 41 CFR part 101-1.)

          § 102-2.65   When may agencies deviate from the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.65

          Because, it consists primarily of set policies and mandatory requirements, deviation from the FMR should occur infrequently. However, to address unique circumstances or to test the effectiveness of potential policy changes, agencies may be able to deviate from the FMR after following the steps described in § 102-2.80.

          § 102-2.70   What are individual and class deviations?

#### § § 102-2.70

          An individual deviation is intended to affect only one action. A class deviation is intended to affect more than one action (e.g., multiple actions, the actions of more than one agency, or individual agency actions that are expected to recur).

          § 102-2.75   What timeframes apply to deviations?

#### § § 102-2.75

          Timeframes vary based on the nature of the deviation. However, deviations cannot be open-ended. When consulting with GSA about using an individual or class deviation, you must set a timeframe for the deviation's duration.

          § 102-2.80   What steps must an agency take to deviate from the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.80

          (a) Consult informally with appropriate GSA program personnel to learn more about how your agency can work within the FMR's requirements instead of deviating from them. The consultation process may also highlight reasons why an agency would not be permitted to deviate from the FMR; e.g., statutory constraints.

          (b) Formally request a deviation, if consultations indicate that your agency needs one. The head of your agency or a designated official should write to GSA's Regulatory Secretariat to the attention of a GSA official in the program office that is likely to consider the deviation. (See the FMR bulletin that lists contacts in GSA's program offices and § 102-2.90.) The written request must fully explain the reasons for the deviation, including the benefits that the agency expects to achieve.

          § 102-2.85   What are the reasons for writing to GSA about FMR deviations?

#### § § 102-2.85

          The reasons for writing are to:

          (a) Explain your agency's rationale for the deviation. Before it can adequately comment on a potential deviation from the FMR, GSA must know why it is needed. GSA will compare your need against the applicable policies and regulations.

          (b) Obtain clarification from GSA as to whether statutes, Executive orders, or other controlling policies, which may not be evident in the regulation, preclude deviating from the FMR for the reasons stated.

          (c) Establish a timeframe for using a deviation.

          (d) Identify potential changes to the FMR.

          (e) Identify the benefits and other results that the agency expects to achieve.

          § 102-2.90   Where should my agency send its correspondence on an FMR deviation?

#### § § 102-2.90

          Send correspondence to: General Services Administration, Regulatory Secretariat (MVRS), Office of Governmentwide Policy, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405.

          § 102-2.95   What information must agencies include in their deviation letters to GSA?

#### § § 102-2.95

          Agencies must include:

          (a) The title and citation of the FMR provision from which the agency wishes to deviate;

          (b) The name and telephone number of an agency contact who can discuss the reason for the deviation;

          (c) The reason for the deviation;

          (d) A statement about the expected benefits of using the deviation (to the extent possible, expected benefits should be stated in measurable terms);

          (e) A statement about possible use of the deviation in other agencies or Governmentwide; and

          (f) The duration of the deviation.

          § 102-2.100   Must agencies provide GSA with a follow-up analysis of their experience in deviating from the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.100

          Yes, agencies that deviate from the FMR must also write to the relevant GSA program office at the Regulatory Secretariat's address (see § 102-2.90) to describe their experiences in using a deviation.

          § 102-2.105   What information must agencies include in their follow-up analysis?

#### § § 102-2.105

          In your follow-up analysis, provide information that may include, but should not be limited to, specific actions taken or not taken as a result of the deviation, outcomes, impacts, anticipated versus actual results, and the advantages and disadvantages of taking an alternative course of action.

          § 102-2.110   When must agencies provide their follow-up letters?

#### § § 102-2.110

          (a) For an individual deviation, once the action is complete.

          (b) For a class deviation, at the end of each twelve-month period from the time you first took the deviation and at the end of the deviation period.

        Non-Regulatory Material

          § 102-2.115   What kinds of non-regulatory material does GSA publish outside of the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.115

          As GSA converts the FPMR to the FMR, non-regulatory materials in the FPMR, such as guidance, procedures, standards, and information, that describe how to do business with GSA, will become available in separate documents. These documents may include customer service guides, handbooks, brochures, Internet websites, and FMR bulletins. GSA will eliminate non-regulatory material that is no longer needed.

          § 102-2.120   How do I know whom to contact to discuss the regulatory requirements of programs addressed in the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.120

          Periodically, GSA will issue for your reference an FMR bulletin that lists program contacts with whom agencies can discuss regulatory requirements. At a minimum, the list will contain organization names and telephone numbers for each program addressed in the FMR.

          § 102-2.125   What source of information can my agency use to identify materials that describe how to do business with GSA?

#### § § 102-2.125

          The FMR establishes policy; it does not specify procedures for the acquisition of GSA services. However, as a service to users during the transition from the FPMR to the FMR and as needed thereafter, GSA will issue FMR bulletins to identify where to find information on how to do business with GSA. References include customer service guides, handbooks, brochures, Internet websites, etc.

      Subpart B—Forms

        § 102-2.130   Where are FMR forms prescribed?

#### § § 102-2.130

        In any of its parts, the FMR may prescribe forms and the requirements for using them.

        § 102-2.135   How do agencies obtain forms prescribed by the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.135

        For copies of the forms prescribed by in the FMR, do any of the following:

        (a) Write to us at: General Services Administration, National Forms and Publications Center (7CPN), Warehouse 4, Dock No. 1, 501 West Felix Street, Fort Worth, TX 76115.

        (b) Send e-mail messages to:

        (c) Visit our web site at:

      Subpart C—Plain Language Regulatory Style

        § 102-2.140   What elements of plain language appear in the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.140

        The FMR is written in a “plain language” regulatory style. This style is easy to read and uses a question and answer format directed at the reader, active voice, shorter sentences, and, where appropriate, personal pronouns.

        § 102-2.145   To what do pronouns refer when used in the FMR?

#### § § 102-2.145

        Throughout its text, the FMR may contain pronouns such as, but not limited to, we, you, and I. When pronouns are used, each subchapter of the FMR will indicate whether they refer to the reader, an agency, GSA, or some other entity. In general, pronouns refer to who or what must perform a required action.

    PART 102-3—FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT

### Part 102

**Authority:** Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 5 U.S.C. chapter 10; and E.O. 12024, 42 FR 61445, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 158.

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 27679, Apr. 18, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—What Policies Apply to Advisory Committees Established Within the Executive Branch?

        § 102-3.5   What does this part cover and how does it apply?

#### § § 102-3.5

        This part provides the policy framework and establishes minimum requirements that must be used by agency heads and Federal officers in applying the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (FACA or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C. chapter 10, to advisory committees they establish and operate. In addition to listing key definitions underlying the interpretation of the Act, this part establishes the scope and applicability of the Act and outlines specific exclusions from its coverage. This part is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person, including any advisory committee or officer, member, employee, agent, or contractor of any advisory committee.

        § 102-3.10   What is the purpose of the Federal Advisory Committee Act?

#### § § 102-3.10

        FACA governs the establishment, operation, administration, and termination of advisory committees within the executive branch of the Federal Government. The Act defines what constitutes a Federal advisory committee and provides general procedures for the executive branch to follow for the operation of these advisory committees. In addition, the Act is designed to assure that the Congress and the public are kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, recommendations, outcomes, and cost of advisory committees through reporting requirements. These requirements form the basis for implementing the Act at both the agency and Government-wide levels.

        §§ 102-3.15-102-3.20   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 102-3.15-102-3.20

        § 102-3.25   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 102-3.25

        The following definitions apply to this part:

        means the Federal Advisory Committee _Act_ (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. chapter 10.

        means the _Administrator_ of General Services.

        means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, which is established by statute, or established or utilized by the President or by an agency official, for the purpose of obtaining the group's advice or recommendations for the President or on issues or policies within the scope of agency responsibilities (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1001). _Advisory committee_s are subject to the Act unless specifically exempted by the Act, or by other statutes, or not covered by this part.

        has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 551(1).

        means the head of an executive branch agency, department, or commission, or their designated delegate.

        means the advisory committee or subcommittee member who serves in this role on an advisory committee or subcommittee by statutory requirement, or by appointment or invitation by Presidential authority or an agency's authority.

        means the individual designated by the agency head to implement the provisions of sec. 8(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1007(b)) and any delegated responsibilities of the agency head under the Act.

        means the organization established pursuant to sec. 7(a) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1006(a)), which is responsible for all matters relating to advisory committees and carries out the responsibilities of the Administrator under the Act and E.O. 12024 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 158).

        means any gathering of advisory committee members (whether in person or electronically, such as using telecommunications or through a virtual platform), held with the approval of an agency, and with a Designated Federal Officer in attendance, for the purpose of deliberating on the matters upon which the advisory committee provides advice or recommendations.

        means an individual who serves by appointment or invitation by the appointing authority on an advisory committee or subcommittee.

        means any Federal employee, private individual, or other party (whether under contract or not) who is not a committee member, and who serves in a support capacity to an advisory committee or subcommittee. _Committee staff_ serve in coordination with the Designated Federal Officer.

        means an individual designated by the agency head, for each advisory committee for which the agency head is responsible, to implement the provisions of secs. 10(e) and (f) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(e) and (f)) and any advisory committee procedures of the agency under the control and supervision of the CMO.

        means any advisory committee that is established under the authority of an agency head or authorized by statute. An advisory committee referenced in general (non-specific) authorizing language or Congressional committee report language is discretionary, and its establishment or termination is within the legal discretion of an agency head.

        means an individual who assists the CMO in overseeing and managing a portion of the agency's Federal advisory committee management program.

        means any Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the Congress, or by the President or the President's delegate, to an agency for administrative and other support.

        means any advisory committee either required by statute or by Presidential directive. A non-discretionary advisory committee required by statute generally is identified specifically in a statute by name, purpose, or function(s), and its establishment or termination is beyond the legal discretion of an agency head.

        means any advisory committee authorized by the Congress or directed by the President to advise the President.

        means a group that reports to an advisory committee, and not directly to a Federal officer or agency, whether or not its members are drawn in whole or in part from the parent advisory committee. However, if a subcommittee makes advice or recommendations directly to a Federal officer or agency, it is no longer functioning as a subcommittee, and must: file a charter following the requirements of § 102-3.70, that includes the information required in § 102-3.75; comply with all of the requirements of this part; and will be counted as a chartered advisory committee at an agency.

        means a committee that is one over which the President or a Federal officer or agency exercises actual management or control of its operation, whether or not it was established by the Federal Government.

        § 102-3.30   What policies govern the use of advisory committees?

#### § § 102-3.30

        These are the policies to be followed by Federal departments and agencies in establishing and operating advisory committees consistent with the Act:

        (a)  A discretionary advisory committee may be established only when it is essential to the conduct of agency business and when the information to be obtained is not already available through another advisory committee or source within the Federal Government.

        (b)  Advisory committees terminate pursuant to § 102-3.55.

        (c)  An advisory committee must be fairly balanced in its membership in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed (as explained further in § 102-3.60).

        (d)  Advisory committee meetings must be open to the public except when a meeting is closed or partially closed in accordance with the exemptions set forth in the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c).

        (1)  With the support of the sponsoring Federal department or agency, the advisory committee must provide reasonable modifications for individuals with disabilities when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the program or activity. The advisory committee must also take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with individuals with disabilities are as effective as communications with others, including by furnishing appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the advisory committee. Examples of auxiliary aids and services include qualified interpreters and information in alternate formats, such as braille or large print. In order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a disability. An advisory committee may not charge for the provision of auxiliary aids and services. An advisory committee is not required to provide an aid or service if it can demonstrate that providing that aid or service would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. Advisory committees should consider how to ensure that advisory committee members and members of the public are made aware that qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to effective communication, including appropriate auxiliary aids and services. Advisory committees should also consider how to ensure that advisory committee members and members of the public are made aware of the option to request reasonable modifications in advance of meetings and should identify a point of contact to receive and respond to requests for reasonable modifications.

        (2)  With the support of the sponsoring Federal department or agency, the advisory committee must ensure equal participation by individuals with limited English proficiency. This may include conducting outreach and providing notifications in the language(s) used by the affected communities and potential or actual advisory committee members, as well as providing language assistance services, including electronic and printed written translated documents and oral interpretation services free of charge and in a timely manner, when such services are necessary to provide meaningful access to a limited English proficient individual, consistent with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d  and E.O. 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons With Limited English Proficiency, 3 CFR, 2000 Comp., p. 289.

        (e)  The function of advisory committees is advisory only, unless specifically provided by statute or Presidential directive.

        § 102-3.35   What policies govern the use of subcommittees?

#### § § 102-3.35

        (a) In general, the requirements of the Act and the policies of this part do not apply to subcommittees of advisory committees that report to a parent advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer or agency. However, this section does not preclude an agency from applying any provision of the Act and this part to any subcommittee of an advisory committee.

        (b) If a subcommittee reports directly to a Federal officer or agency, it is no longer functioning as a subcommittee. In that case, the subcommittee must be chartered as a new advisory committee, must comply with all of the requirements of this part, and will be counted as a chartered advisory committee at an agency.

        (c) Unless required by statute or Presidential directive, the creation and operation of subcommittees must be approved by the agency establishing the parent advisory committee in coordination with the DFO.

        § 102-3.40   What types of committees or groups are not covered by the Act and this part?

#### § § 102-3.40

        In addition to the committees created by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Public Administration (except as covered by subpart E of this part), the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Reserve, the following are examples of committees or groups that are not covered by the Act or this part:

        (a) Any advisory committee established or utilized by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, if the Director of National Intelligence determines that for reasons of national security such advisory committee cannot comply with the requirements of the Act;

        (b) Committees specifically exempted by statute;

        (c) Committees created by non-Federal entities and not actually managed or controlled by the executive branch;

        (d) Groups assembled where attendees provide individual advice to a Federal official(s);

        (e) Groups assembled to exchange facts or information with a Federal official(s);

        (f) Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government and elected officers of State, local, and Tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf), acting in their official capacities. The purpose of such a committee must be solely to exchange views, information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs established pursuant to statute, that explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or administration (see guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on sec. 204(b) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), and OMB Memorandum M-95-20, dated September 21, 1995, available on the Committee Management Secretariat website);

        (g) Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government;

        (h) Local civic groups whose primary function is that of rendering a public service with respect to a Federal program;

        (i) Groups established to advise State or local officials;

        (j) Any committee established to perform primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those specifically authorized by statute or Presidential directive, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. A committee designated operational may be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature; and

        (k) Any committee established, created, managed, and staffed by the government of a foreign country; or any committee created, managed, and staffed by an executive branch agency to advise or make recommendations to a government official, government group, or government agency of a foreign country.

      Subpart B—How Are Advisory Committees Established, Renewed, Reestablished, Merged, and Terminated?

        § 102-3.45   What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

#### § § 102-3.45

        Requirements for establishing and terminating advisory committees vary depending on the establishing entity and the source of authority for the advisory committee. This subpart covers the procedures associated with the establishment, renewal, reestablishment, merger, and termination of advisory committees. These procedures include, but are not limited to, consulting with the Secretariat, preparing and filing an advisory committee charter, publishing notice in the  and amending an advisory committee charter.

        § 102-3.50   What are the authorities for establishing advisory committees?

#### § § 102-3.50

        FACA identifies four sources of authority for establishing an advisory committee:

        (a)  By law where Congress establishes an advisory committee, or specifically directs the President or an agency to establish it (non-discretionary);

        (b)  By E.O. of the President or other Presidential directive (non-discretionary);

        (c)  By law where Congress authorizes, but does not direct the President or an agency to establish it (discretionary); or

        (d)  By an agency under general authority in title 5 of the United States Code or under other agency-authorizing statutes (discretionary).

        § 102-3.55   What rules apply to the duration of an advisory committee?

#### § § 102-3.55

        (a) An advisory committee automatically terminates two years after its date of establishment unless:

        (1) The statutory authority used to establish the advisory committee provides a different duration or termination, either stated in or implied by operation of the statute;

        (2) The President or agency head determines that the advisory committee has fulfilled the purpose for which it was established and terminates the advisory committee earlier;

        (3) The President or agency head determines that the advisory committee is no longer carrying out the purpose for which it was established and terminates the advisory committee earlier; or

        (4) The President or agency head renews the advisory committee not later than two years after its date of establishment, renewal, or reestablishment in accordance with § 102-3.60. If the President or an agency needs an advisory committee that was terminated, it can be reestablished in accordance with § 102-3.60.

        (b) When an advisory committee terminates, the agency shall notify the Secretariat of the effective date of the termination.

        § 102-3.60   What procedures are required to establish, renew, reestablish, or merge a discretionary advisory committee?

#### § § 102-3.60

        (a)  To establish, renew, reestablish, or merge a discretionary advisory committee, the agency head must first consult with the Secretariat. As part of this consultation, agency heads should provide the Secretariat with a full understanding of the background and purpose behind the advisory committee, and the Secretariat should share its knowledge and experience with the agency.

        (b)  Consultations covering the establishment, renewal, reestablishment, or merger of advisory committees must, as a minimum, contain the following information:

        (1)  An explanation stating why the advisory committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and in the public interest or why it is necessary to merge one or more advisory committees;

        (2)  An explanation stating why the advisory committee's functions cannot be performed by the agency, another existing committee, or other means such as a public hearing or other methods of public engagement; and

        (3)  A description of the agency's plan to attain fairly balanced membership, as appropriate based on the nature and functions of the advisory committee, as documented through the agency's Membership Balance Plan (MBP). The MBP must be uploaded to the FACA database when the agency files the Federal advisory committee charter with the Secretariat.

        (i)  During the formation of the advisory committee membership and as membership vacancies occur, agencies should ensure that they fully consider and understand the potential implications or anticipated impacts of the advisory committee's potential recommendations. This includes consideration of the groups and entities potentially affected or interested in such recommendations, as appropriate based on the nature and functions of the advisory committee, so that the agency can make informed decisions on the areas of expertise or perspectives (including relevant lived experience) that would advance the work of the advisory committee. Advisory committees requiring technical expertise should include persons with demonstrated professional or personal qualifications and experience relevant to the functions and tasks to be performed by the committee. The MBP shall describe the agency's conclusions regarding the points of view that would promote fairly balanced committee membership.

        (ii)  Having identified the points of view that would promote a fairly balanced advisory committee membership, agencies should conduct broad outreach, using a variety of means and methods, to ensure that the call for nominees reaches the interested parties and stakeholder groups likely to possess those points of view. Agencies should further ensure outreach to underserved communities, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the advisory committee. The MBP shall describe the agency's intended outreach efforts to accomplish these goals.

        (iii)  In the selection of members for the advisory committee and as membership vacancies occur, agencies shall ensure representation of persons with the points of view identified pursuant to this section that would promote a fairly balanced advisory committee membership. The MBP shall describe the agency's intended selection criteria and approach.

        § 102-3.65   What are the public notification requirements for discretionary advisory committees?

#### § § 102-3.65

        A notice to the public in the  is required when a discretionary advisory committee is established, renewed, reestablished, or a new discretionary committee is established as the result of a merger of existing committees. The notices should be written in plain language and should not assume that the public has background knowledge or familiarity with an agency or the advisory committee. The agency is also strongly encouraged to make the notice available electronically in the languages represented by the affected communities on the agency's advisory committee website, if one exists, as well as use additional notification methods (such as an agency's social media accounts) to reach advisory committee stakeholders (such as professional trade or membership groups, civic groups, community-based organizations, ethnic media, representatives of affected stakeholder groups, and colleges and universities). Electronic notices must meet the requirements of title VI and E.O. 13166, as well as obligations under relevant sections of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794.

        (a)  Upon receiving notice from the Secretariat that its review is complete in accordance with § 102-3.60(a), the agency must publish a notice in the  announcing that the advisory committee is being established (including due to a merger), renewed, or reestablished. When establishing a new advisory committee, the notice also must describe the nature and purpose of the advisory committee and affirm that the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest.

        (b)  Notices of advisory committee establishment (including due to a merger) and reestablishment must appear at least 15 calendar days before the charter is filed, except that the Secretariat may approve less than 15 calendar days when requested by the agency in exceptional circumstances (such as a national emergency or natural disaster). This requirement for advance notice does not apply to advisory committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with the filing of the charter.

        § 102-3.70   What are the charter filing requirements?

#### § § 102-3.70

        No advisory committee may meet or take any action until a charter has been filed by the CMO or by another agency official designated by the agency head.

        (a)  To amend a charter, or establish (including due to a merger), renew, or reestablish a discretionary advisory committee, a charter must be filed with:

        (1) The agency head;

        (2) The standing committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction of the agency, the date of filing with which constitutes the official date of establishment for the advisory committee;

        (3) The Library of Congress; and

        (4) The Secretariat, indicating the date the charter was filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (b)  Charter filing requirements for non-discretionary advisory committees are the same as those in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the date of establishment, renewal, or reestablishment for a Presidential advisory committee is the date the charter is filed with the Secretariat.

        (c)  Subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or agency must comply with this subpart and be chartered as a new advisory committee as they are no longer functioning as a subcommittee.

        § 102-3.75   What information must be included in the charter of an advisory committee?

#### § § 102-3.75

        An advisory committee charter is intended to provide a description of an advisory committee's mission, goals, and objectives. The charter must contain the following information:

        (o) The date the charter is filed in accordance with § 102-3.70.

        § 102-3.80   How are charter amendments accomplished?

#### § § 102-3.80

        The agency head is responsible for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amending any existing advisory committee charter does not constitute renewal of the advisory committee under § 102-3.60. The procedures for making changes and filing amended charters will depend upon the authority basis for the advisory committee, as stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:

        (a)  The agency head must ensure that any changes made to current charters are consistent with the relevant authority. When Congress by law, or the President by Presidential directive ( E.O.), changes the authorizing language that has been the basis for establishing an advisory committee, the agency head or the chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must amend those sections of the current charter affected by the new statute or Presidential directive ( E.O.); file the amended charter as specified in § 102-3.70; and notify the public as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  The charter of a discretionary advisory committee must be amended when an agency head determines that provisions of a filed charter are inaccurate, specific provisions have changed or become obsolete with the passing of time, or advisory committees need to be merged. Amendments could also include changing the name of the advisory committee, advisory committee authority, number of members, estimated number or frequency of meetings, objectives and scope, duties, and estimated costs. The agency must amend the charter language as necessary and the agency must:

        (1) First consult with the Secretariat and explain the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary. The Secretariat will notify the agency when the consultation process is complete.

        (2) Upon receiving notice from the Secretariat that the consultation is complete, file the amended charter as specified in § 102-3.70, and notify the public as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  Agencies must post an announcement and a copy of the charter amendment on the advisory committee website. If an advisory committee website is not available, the agency must publish a notice of amendment in the   notice publishing and website posting of charter amendments may be performed concurrently with the filing of the charter. The publishing requirement in the  does not apply to a non-discretionary advisory committee if the amendment was the result of a legislative change or Presidential directive.

        § 102-3.85   [Reserved]

#### § § 102-3.85

      Subpart C—How Are Advisory Committees Managed?

        § 102-3.90   What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

        This subpart outlines specific responsibilities and functions to be carried out by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the agency head, the CMO, and the DFO under the Act.

        § 102-3.95   What principles apply to the management of advisory committees?

#### § § 102-3.95

        Agencies are encouraged to apply the following principles to the management of their advisory committees:

        (a)  Before establishing an advisory committee, agencies should identify requirements and ensure that adequate resources are available to support anticipated activities. Considerations related to support could include work and meeting space, necessary technology, supplies and equipment (e.g., adequate virtual meeting capabilities), Federal staff support, access to key decisionmakers, and member access to meetings (e.g., travel reimbursement). These considerations should also include support for access to communication modes that are inclusive of individuals with limited English proficiency or individuals with disabilities (e.g., adequate virtual meeting capabilities). These considerations should also include whether there are physical barriers to attending in-person meetings.

        (b)  Agencies should seek to be as transparent, equitable, inclusive, accessible, and timely as possible when providing public access to advisory committee activities and materials. Agencies should minimize, to the extent possible, closing or partially closing meetings, and are encouraged where appropriate to open subcommittee meetings to the public. Agencies should also create public facing websites at both the agency and advisory committee level to help the public understand an agency's advisory committee program, and use additional notification methods, as appropriate, to reach advisory committee stakeholders, pursuant to sec. 10 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009). Such websites must be in compliance with E.O. 13166, relevant sections of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794, and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA). Section 3(e) of 21st Century IDEA requires any public Federal agency website created after December 2018 to be in compliance with the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration. IDEA, Public Law 115-336, 132 Stat. 5025.

        (c)  Once the Federal advisory committee is formed, committee chairs and DFOs should foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion by encouraging engagement, participation, and expression from all committee members and any members with dissenting opinions, as applicable.

        (d)  Agencies should continually seek feedback from advisory committee members and the public regarding the advisory committee's activities. At regular intervals, agencies should communicate to the members how their advice has affected agency programs and decision making and make this information available to the public.

#### § § 102-3.155

        To close all or part of an advisory committee meeting, the DFO must:

        (a)  Submit a request to the agency head, or in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the Secretariat, citing the specific exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), that justifies the closure. The request must provide the agency head or the Secretariat sufficient time (generally 30 calendar days) to review the matter in order to make a determination before publication of the meeting notice required by § 102-3.150;

        (b)  The Office of the General Counsel (or equivalent legal office) of the agency or, in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, GSA's Office of the General Counsel, should review all requests to close meetings;

        (c)  If the agency head, or in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, GSA, finds that the request is consistent with the provisions of the Government in the Sunshine Act and FACA, the appropriate agency official must issue a determination that all or part of the meeting will be closed; and

        (d)  The agency head or the chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must make a copy of the determination available to the public upon request.

        § 102-3.160   What activities of an advisory committee are not subject to the notice and open meeting requirements of the Act?

#### § § 102-3.160

        The following activities of an advisory committee are excluded from the procedural requirements contained in this subpart:

        (a)  Meetings of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members convened solely to gather information, conduct research, or analyze relevant issues and facts in preparation for deliberation by advisory committee members in a public meeting of the advisory committee, or deliberation by subcommittee members in a public meeting of the subcommittee (where applicable). These meetings to conduct preparatory work do not include deliberation among advisory committee or subcommittee members; and

        (b)  Meetings of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members convened solely to discuss administrative matters of the advisory committee or subcommittee (such as meeting logistics) or to receive administrative information from a Federal officer or agency (such as a briefing on ethics or FACA procedural requirements).

        § 102-3.165   How are advisory committee meetings documented?

#### § § 102-3.165

        (a) The agency head or, in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the chairperson must ensure that detailed minutes of each advisory committee meeting, including one that is closed or partially closed to the public, are kept. The chairperson of each advisory committee must certify the accuracy of all minutes of advisory committee meetings.

        (b) The minutes must include:

        (1) The time, date, and place (or electronic format) of the advisory committee meeting;

        (2) A list of the persons who were present at the meeting, including advisory committee members and staff, agency employees, and members of the public who presented oral or written statements;

        (3) An accurate description of each matter discussed and the resolution, if any, made by the advisory committee regarding such matter; and

        (4) Copies of each report or other materials received, issued, or approved by the advisory committee at the meeting.

        (c) The DFO must ensure that minutes are certified for accuracy by the chairperson within 90 calendar days of the meeting to which they relate. Agencies should post the meeting minutes on the agency advisory committee website (if one exists) not later than 14 calendar days after the meeting minutes have been certified.

        § 102-3.170   How does an interested party obtain access to advisory committee records?

#### § § 102-3.170

        Timely access to advisory committee records is an important element of the public access requirements of the Act. Section 10(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(b)) provides for the contemporaneous availability of advisory committee records that, when taken in conjunction with the ability to attend committee meetings, provide a meaningful opportunity to comprehend fully the work undertaken by the advisory committee. Although certain advisory committee records may be withheld under an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), agencies may not require members of the public or other interested parties to use FOIA procedures in order to obtain records available under sec. 10(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(b)).

        § 102-3.175   What are the reporting and recordkeeping requirements for an advisory committee?

#### § § 102-3.175

        (a)  Within one year after a Presidential advisory committee has submitted a public report to the President, a follow-up report required by sec. 6(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1005(b)) must be prepared and transmitted to the Congress detailing the disposition of the advisory committee's recommendations. These reports are prepared and transmitted to the Congress as directed by the President, either by the President's delegate, by the agency responsible for providing support to a Presidential advisory committee, or by the responsible agency or organization designated in the charter of the Presidential advisory committee pursuant to § 102-3.75(f).

        (b)  Per sec. 7(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1006(b)), GSA is required to conduct an Annual Comprehensive Review (ACR) of the activities and responsibilities of each Federal advisory committee that was in existence during any part of a Federal fiscal year. The Secretariat initiates this review, provides guidance to the agencies and departments on how to conduct the review, and closes out the ACR when all reviews have been completed. Federal agencies are responsible for reporting data on each advisory committee, such as its purpose, performance measures, subcommittees (if applicable), meeting, membership, and cost, into the GSA FACA database. CMOs, DFOs, and other responsible agency officials, such as GFOs, enter this data for the advisory committees they are responsible for in their agency. The FACA database provides transparency to the public on the activities of Federal advisory committees Government-wide. The database is also used by Congress to perform oversight of the FACA program, and by the general public, the media, and others to stay abreast of important developments resulting from Federal advisory committee activities.

        (c)  In accordance with sec. 10(d) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(d)), advisory committees holding closed or partially closed meetings must issue reports at least annually, setting forth a summary of activities and such related matters as would be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. 552(b).

        (d)  Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552, copies of each report made by an advisory committee, including any report of closed or partially closed meetings as specified in paragraph (c) of this section and, where appropriate, background papers prepared by experts or consultants, must be filed with the Library of Congress as required by sec. 13 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1012) for public inspection and use.

        (e)  Official records generated by or for an advisory committee must be retained for the duration of the advisory committee. Upon termination of the advisory committee, the records must be processed in accordance with the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. chapters 21 and 29 through 33, and regulations issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (see 36 CFR parts 1220, 1222, 1228, and 1234), or in accordance with the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. chapter 22.

      Subpart E—How Does This Subpart Apply to Advice or Recommendations Provided to Agencies by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration?

        § 102-3.180   What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

#### § § 102-3.180

        This subpart provides guidance to agencies on compliance with sec. 15 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014). Section 15 establishes requirements that apply only in connection with a funding or other written agreement involving an agency's use of advice or recommendations provided to the agency by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), if such advice or recommendations were developed by use of a committee created by either academy. For purposes of this subpart, NAS also includes the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Medicine, and the National Research Council. Except with respect to NAS committees that were the subject of judicial actions filed before December 17, 1997, no part of the Act other than sec. 15 applies to any committee created by NAS or NAPA.

        § 102-3.185   What does this subpart require agencies to do?

#### § § 102-3.185

        (a)  An agency may not use any advice or recommendation provided to an agency by NAS or NAPA under an agreement between the agency and an academy, if such advice or recommendation was developed by use of a committee created by either academy, unless:

        (1) The committee was not subject to any actual management or control by an agency or officer of the Federal Government; and

        (2) In the case of NAS, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of sec. 15(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014(b)); or

        (3) In the case of NAPA, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of sec. 15(b) (1), (2), and (5) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014(b)(1), (2), and (5), respectively).

        (b)  Agencies must not manage or control the specific procedures adopted by each academy to comply with the requirements of sec. 15 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014) that are applicable to that academy. In addition, however, any committee created and used by an academy in the development of any advice or recommendation to be provided by the academy to an agency must be subject to both actual management and control by that academy and not by the agency.

        (c)  Agencies may enter into contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with NAS or NAPA that are consistent with the requirements of this subpart to obtain advice or recommendations from such academy. These funding agreements require, and agencies may rely upon, a written certification by an authorized representative of the academy provided to the agency upon delivery to the agency of each report containing advice or recommendations required under the agreement that:

        (1) The academy has adopted policies and procedures that comply with the applicable requirements of sec. 15 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014); and

        (2) To the best of the authorized representative's knowledge and belief, these policies and procedures substantially have been complied with in performing the work required under the agreement.

      Subpart F—Severability

        § 102-3.190   What portions of this part are severable?

#### § § 102-3.190

        All provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. If any provision is stayed or determined to be invalid, it is GSA's intention that the remaining provisions shall continue in effect.

This information should include the job title, number, and operational level where the work is to be performed (e.g., five recruiter personnel or, positions at the Detroit Army Recruiting Battalion).

        § 102-5.90   Should an agency consider whether to base a Government passenger carrier at a Government facility near the employee's home or work rather than authorize home-to-work transportation?

#### § § 102-5.90

        § 102-5.105   May others accompany an employee using home-to-work transportation?

#### § § 102-5.105

        Yes, an employee authorized for home-to-work transportation may share space in a Government passenger carrier with other individuals, provided that the passenger carrier does not travel additional distances as a result and such sharing is consistent with the employee's Federal agency's policy.  When a Federal agency establishes its space sharing policy, the Federal agency should consider its potential liability for and to those individuals. Home-to-work transportation does not extend to the employee's spouse, other relatives, or friends unless they travel with the employee from the same point of departure to the same destination, and this use is consistent with the Federal agency's policy.

          § 102-33.20   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 102-33.20

          The following definitions apply to this part:

          means to procure or otherwise obtain personal property, including by lease or rent.

          means the date that the acquiring executive agency took responsibility for the aircraft,  received title (through purchase, exchange, or gift), signed a bailment agreement with the Department of Defense (DOD), took physical custody, received a court order, put into operational status an aircraft that is newly manufactured by the agency, or otherwise accepted physical transfer ( in the case of a borrowed aircraft).

          means an individual component or an assembly of components that is used on aircraft.

          mean the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including their regular and Reserve components and members serving without component status. For purposes of this part, the National Guard is also included in the _Armed Forces_.

          means equipment that protects flight crewmembers and others aboard an aircraft, assisting their safe escape, survival, and recovery during an accident or other emergency.

          is a division in the Office of Asset and Transportation Management, Office of Government-wide Policy, GSA. Contact the staff via the Aircraft Management Overview page at

          means a person assigned to operate or assist in operating an aircraft during flight time. _Crewmember_s perform duties directly related to the operation of the aircraft ( as pilots, co-pilots, flight engineers, navigators) or duties assisting in operation of the aircraft ( as flight directors, crew chiefs, electronics technicians, mechanics). See also the terms and definitions for “Qualified non-crewmember” and “Passenger” in this section.

          means a single digit code that DOD assigns to military Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP) (see §§ 102-33.115 and 102-33.370).

          means a fireproof plate that is inscribed with certain information required by 14 CFR part 45 (or for military surplus aircraft, as required by Military Specifications), and secured to an aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller. The information must be marked by etching, stamping, engraving, or other approved method of fireproof marking. The plate must be attached in such a manner that it is not likely to be defaced or removed during normal service or lost or destroyed in an accident. _Data plate_s are required only on certificated aircraft. However, non-certificated aircraft may also have data plates.

          means to remove a lost, destroyed, or non-operational aircraft from the Federal aircraft inventory. Agencies may declassify only non-operational aircraft that they will retain for ground use only. Agencies must declassify an aircraft following the rules in §§ 102-33.415 and 102-33.420.

          means the date that the disposing executive agency relinquishes responsibility for an aircraft, for example, when the agency transfers title in the case of an exchange/sale; returns the aircraft to the lessor or bailer; declassifies it (for FAIRS, declassification is considered a “disposal” action, even though the agency retains the property); or relinquishes custody to another agency ( in the case of excess (transferred) or surplus (donated or sold) aircraft).

          means an aircraft disposed of as surplus by GSA through donation to a non-Federal government, a tax-exempt nonprofit entity, or other eligible recipient, following the rules in part § 102-37 (some agencies, for example DOD, may have independent donation authority.)

          means to replace personal property by trade or trade-in with the supplier of the replacement property.

          means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property. See 40 U.S.C. 503.

          means a condition under which an aircraft is operated for the sole benefit of the U.S. Government.

          means any executive department or independent establishment in the executive branch of the United States Government, including any wholly owned Government corporation. See 5 U.S.C. 105.

          means a component of GSA. FAS is organized by geographical regions. The FAS Property Management Division in GSA's Pacific Rim Region, 450 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102-3434, has responsibility for disposing of excess and surplus aircraft.

          means manned or unmanned aircraft that an executive agency owns ( holds title to) or borrows for any length of time. _Federal aircraft_ include—

          (1) Bailed aircraft: Federal aircraft that is owned by one executive agency, but is in the custody of and operated by another executive agency under an agreement that may or may not include cost-reimbursement. Bailments are executive agency to executive agency agreements and involve only aircraft, not services;

          (2) Borrowed aircraft: Aircraft owned by a non-executive agency and provided to an executive agency for use without compensation. The executive agency operates and maintains the aircraft;

          (3) Forfeited aircraft: Aircraft acquired by the Government either by summary process or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to any law of the United States;

          (4) Loaned aircraft: Federal aircraft owned by an executive agency, but in the custody of a non-executive agency under an agreement that does not include compensation; and

          (5) Owned aircraft: An aircraft for which title or rights of title are vested in an executive agency.

          is a management information system operated by GSA to collect, maintain, analyze, and report information on Federal aircraft inventories and cost and usage of Federal aircraft and CAS aircraft (and related services) (see §§ 102-33.395 through 102-33.440).

          means any aircraft part, assembly, or installation containing a critical characteristic whose failure, malfunction, or absence could cause a catastrophic failure resulting in loss or serious damage to the aircraft or an uncommanded engine shutdown resulting in an unsafe condition.

          means a contractual agreement through which an executive agency acquires an aircraft and related aviation services ( pilot, crew, maintenance, catering) for exclusive use. Aircraft hired under full service contracts are commercial aviation services (CAS), not Federal aircraft, regardless of the length of the contract.

          means manned or unmanned aircraft operated for the exclusive use of an executive agency. _Government aircraft_ include—

          (1) Federal aircraft (see definition for “Federal aircraft” in this section); and

          (2) Aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS). CAS include—

          (i) Leased aircraft for exclusive use for an agreed upon period of time (The acquiring executive agency operates and maintains the aircraft);

          (ii) Capital lease aircraft for which the leasing agency holds an option to take title;

          (iii) Charter aircraft for hire under a contractual agreement for one-time exclusive use that specifies performance (The commercial source operates and maintains a charter aircraft);

          (iv) Rental aircraft obtained commercially under an agreement in which the executive agency has exclusive use for an agreed upon period of time (The executive agency operates, but does not maintain, a rental aircraft);

          (v) Contracting for full services ( aircraft and related aviation services for exclusive use); or

          (vi) Obtaining related aviation services ( services but not aircraft) by commercial contract, except those services acquired to support a Federal aircraft.

          means a Federally-funded activity that an executive agency performs in compliance with its statutory authorities.

          means those agencies identified in the National Security Act, 50 U.S.C. 401a(4).

          means any agreement between two or more executive agencies (including the Department of Defense) in which one agency consents to perform aviation support services ( providing an aircraft and other aviation services or providing only services) for another agency with or without cost-reimbursement. An executive agency-to-executive agency agreement that involves only the use of an aircraft, not services, is a bailment, not an ISSA.

          means any aircraft part that has an established replacement time, inspection interval, or other time-related procedure associated with it. For non-military parts, the FAA specifies life-limited part airworthiness limitations in 14 CFR 21.50, 23.1529, 25.1529, 27.1529, 29.1529, 31.82, 33.4, and 35.5, and on product Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS). Letters authorizing Technical Standards Orders (TSO) must also note or reference mandatory replacement or inspection of parts.

          means an aircraft part used on an aircraft that was developed by the Armed Forces (whether or not it carries an FAA airworthiness certificate).

          means a Federal aircraft that is not safe for flight and, in the owning executive agency's determination, cannot economically be made safe for flight. This definition refers to the aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support equipment capability. An aircraft that is temporarily out of service for maintenance or repair and can economically be made safe for flight is considered an operational aircraft.

          in relation to Government aircraft—

          (1) Includes, but is not limited to—

          (i) Carrying crewmembers, qualified non-crewmembers, and cargo directly required for or associated with performing Governmental functions (including travel-related Governmental functions);

          (iii) Training pilots and other aviation personnel.

          (2) Does not include—

          (i) Using Government aircraft for personal or political purposes, except for required use travel and space available travel as defined in OMB Circular A-126; or

          (ii) Carrying passengers who are not officially authorized to travel on Government aircraft.

          means a Federal aircraft that is safe for flight or, in the owning executive agency's determination, can economically be made safe for flight. This definition refers to the aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support capability. An aircraft temporarily out of service for maintenance or repair is considered an operational aircraft.

          means the person or company who originally designed, engineered, and manufactured, or who currently holds the data rights to manufacture, a specific aircraft or aircraft part. Parts produced under a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) are not considered OEM parts, even though they can be acceptable replacement parts for OEM parts.

          means a person flying onboard a Government aircraft who is officially authorized to travel and who is not a crewmember or qualified non-crewmember.

          means a quantitative or qualitative term or value for reporting organizational activities and results, generally with respect to achieving specific goals related to outcomes, outputs, efficiency, and inputs. When applied to aircraft, performance indicators typically measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes involved with safely delivering aircraft services.

          means the person or company who holds a Production Certificate (PC), Approved Production Inspection System (APIS), Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA), or Technical Standards Orders Authorization (TSOA), issued under provisions of 14 CFR part 21, Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, and who controls the design, manufacture, and quality of a specific aircraft part.

          means an individual, other than a member of the crew, aboard an aircraft—

          (1) Operated by an United States Government agency in the intelligence community; or

          (2) Whose presence is required to perform or is associated with performing the Governmental function for which the aircraft is being operated (Qualified non-crewmembers are not passengers).

          means the unique identification mark that is assigned by the FAA and displayed on U.S.-registered Government aircraft (except Armed Forces aircraft). Foreign-registered aircraft hired as CAS will carry their national registration markings. _Registration mark_ings are commonly referred to as tail numbers.

          means a commercial _contract_ual agreement through which an executive agency hires aviation services only (not aircraft),  pilot, crew, maintenance, cleaning, dispatching, or catering.

          means use of a Government aircraft for the travel of an executive agency officer or employee where the use of the Government aircraft is required because of bona fide communications or security need of the agency or exceptional scheduling requirements. _Required use travel_ must be approved as described in OMB Circular A-126.

          means a systematic process for—

          (1) Identifying risks and hazards associated with alternative courses of action involved in an aviation operation;

          (2) Choosing from among these alternatives the course(s) of action that will promote optimum aviation safety;

          (3) Assessing the likelihood and predicted severity of an injurious mishap within the various courses of action;

          (4) Controlling and mitigating identified risks and hazards within the chosen course(s) of action; and

          (5) Periodically reviewing the chosen course(s) of action to identify possible emerging risks and hazards.

          means approved for flight and refers to an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or part that has been inspected and certified to meet the requirements of applicable regulations, specifications, or standards. When applied to an aircraft that an executive agency operates under FAA regulations, safe for flight means “airworthy,”  the aircraft or related parts meet their design specifications and are in a condition, relative to wear and deterioration, for safe operation. When applied to an aircraft that an executive agency uses, but does not operate under the FAA regulations, safe for flight means a state of compliance with military specifications or the executive agency's own Flight Program Standards, and as approved, inspected, and certified by the agency.

          means a formal, top-down business-like approach to managing safety risk. It includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety, safety risk management, safety policy, safety assurance, and safety promotion. For more information on SMS, refer to FAA Advisory Circular 120-92, “Safety Management Systems for Aviation Service Providers.”

          means the person in an executive agency who is the agency's primary member of the Interagency Committee for Aviation Policy (ICAP). This person must be of appropriate grade and position to represent the agency and promote flight safety and adherence to standards.

          means a part that is safe for flight, can fulfill its operational requirements, and is sufficiently documented to indicate that the part conforms to applicable standards/specifications.

          means an aircraft part, component, or material that any person suspects of not meeting the requirements of an “approved part.” Approved parts are those that are produced in compliance with 14 CFR part 21, are maintained in compliance with 14 CFR parts 43 and 91, and meet applicable design standards. A part, component, or material may be suspect because of its questionable finish, size, or color; improper (or lack of) identification; incomplete or altered paperwork; or any other questionable indication. See detailed guidance in FAA Advisory Circular 21-29, “Detecting and Reporting Suspected Unapproved Parts,” available from the FAA at

          means an aircraft part whose manufacturer or production approval holder can be identified by documentation, markings/characteristics on the part, or packaging of the part. Non-military parts are traceable if you can establish that the parts were manufactured in accordance with or were previously determined to be airworthy under rules in 14 CFR parts 21 and 43. Possible sources for making a traceability determination could be shipping tickets, bar codes, invoices, parts marking ( PMA, TSO), data plates, serial/part numbers, manufacturing production numbers, maintenance records, work orders, etc.

          means instruction for all flight program personnel (to include administrative, maintenance and dispatch personnel), which enables them to qualify initially for their positions and to maintain qualification for their positions over time.

          means an unmanned aircraft and its associated elements related to safe operations, which may include but not be limited to control stations, data communications links, support equipment, payloads, flight termination systems, and launch/recovery equipment. The unmanned aircraft (UA) is the flying component of the system, flown by a pilot via a ground control system, or autonomously through the use of an on-board computer, communication links, and any additional equipment necessary for the unmanned aircraft to operate safely. The Federal Aviation Administration issues either an Airworthiness Directive (AD) or a Certificate of Authorization (COA) for the entire system, not just the flying component of the system. Reporting of UAS costs and flight hours is only required if the accumulated costs for acquisition and operations meets the agency's threshold for capitalization, and the UAS has a useful life of two years or more.

          means an aircraft part that cannot be restored to a condition that is safe for flight because of its age, its physical condition, a non-repairable defect, insufficient documentation, or its non-conformance with applicable standards/specifications.

          means guidance for the accounting of Government aircraft costs published by GSA and is based on the cost guidance within OMB Circular A-126, OMB Circular A-76, FAIRS, and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger.

          § 102-33.215   May we use Government aircraft to carry passengers?

#### § § 102-33.215

          Yes, you may use Government aircraft to carry passengers with the following restrictions:

          (a) You may carry passengers only on aircraft that you operate or require contractually to be operated in accordance with the rules and requirements in 14 CFR; and

          (b) For certain kinds of travel, your agency must justify passengers' presence on Government aircraft. See OMB Circular A-126 and the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) §§ 301-10.260 through 301-10.266, and 301-70.800 through 301-70.808, and 301-70.910 (41 CFR 301-10.260 through 301-10.266, 301-70.800 through 301-70.808, and 301-70.910) for complete information on authorizing travel and analyzing costs before authorizing travel on Government aircraft.

          § 102-33.220   What are the responsibilities of our aviation program in justifying the use of a Government aircraft to transport passengers?

#### § § 102-33.220

          After receiving a request from your agency, your aviation program's responsibilities in justifying the use of a Government aircraft to transport passengers are to your travel approving authority:

          (a) Cost estimates to assist in determining whether or not use of a Government aircraft to carry passengers is justified. See OMB Circular A-126 () for more information on justifying travel on Government aircraft. See also FTR §§ 301-10.260 through 301-10.266, and 301-70.800 through 301-70.808, and 301-70.910 (41 CFR 301-10.260 through 301-10.266, 301-70.800 through 301-70.808, and 301-70.910) for guidance on estimating the cost of using a Government aircraft. The cost of using a Government aircraft is—

          (1) The variable cost of using a Federal aircraft;

          (2) The amount your agency will be charged by a CAS provider; or

          (3) The variable cost of using an aircraft owned by another agency as reported by the owning agency; and

          (b) Information to assist in the analysis of alternatives to travel on Government aircraft. The information must include the following:

          (1) If no follow-on trip is scheduled, all time required to position the aircraft to begin the trip and to return the aircraft to its normal base of operations;

          (2) If a follow-on trip requires repositioning, the cost for the repositioning should be charged to the associated follow-on trip;

          (3) If an aircraft supports a multi-leg trip (a series of flights scheduled sequentially), the use of the aircraft for the total trip may be justified by comparing the total variable cost of the entire trip to the commercial aircraft cost (including charter) for all legs of the trip; and

          (4) The use of foreign aircraft as CAS is authorized when the agency has determined that an equivalent level of safety exists as compared to U.S. operations of a like kind. The safety of passengers shall be the overriding consideration for the selection of travel mode when comparing foreign sources of scheduled commercial airlines and CAS.

          “ The aircraft you are purchasing or receiving in an exchange may not be in compliance with applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements. You are solely responsible for bringing the aircraft into compliance with 14 CFR Chapter I, or other applicable standards, by obtaining all necessary FAA inspections or modifications.

          The purchaser/recipient agrees that the Government shall not be held liable for personal injuries to, disabilities of, or death of the purchaser/recipient, the purchaser's/recipient's employees, or to any other persons arising from or incident to the purchase of this aircraft, its use, or disposition. You will hold the Government harmless from any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to the purchase, use, or resale of this item. This aircraft may have been operated outside the limitations of 14 CFR Chapter I, and some type of inspection may be needed to determine its airworthiness prior to being flown. You should be aware of the items below prior to operating this aircraft.

          • All civil and public aircraft must have a valid registration issued by the FAA as required by 14 CFR Chapter I.

          • Civil aircraft must have a valid airworthiness certificate in order to operate in the U.S. airspace.

          • In order for the aircraft to be eligible for a standard airworthiness certificate, the aircraft must conform to its FAA Type Certificate.

          • Aircraft not having a valid airworthiness certificate may be eligible for a special FAA one-time flight permit to enable relocating the aircraft. Relocation can be for a number of reasons, including storage, repair, inspection, or public display. Any one-time flight approval is predicated on the aircraft being safe for flight.

          • Individuals who purchase a surplus military (foreign or domestic) or foreign aircraft not having any type of FAA Type Certificate may be unable to obtain any type of airworthiness certificate or special flight permit.

          • An aircraft with good maintenance and inspection records makes an airworthiness determination easier to ascertain. It is in your best interest to contact the nearest FAA Flight Standards District Office and discuss your responsibilities with respect to gaining an airworthiness determination. The location of your nearest FAA office may be obtained from the FAA's Web site ().

          • When the aircraft is purchased for spare parts and the airframe is scrapped, you should declassify the aircraft (see § 102-33.420 for more information), complete the back of the aircraft's registration form and send it to: The FAA Aircraft Registration Branch, P.O.

      § 102-35.15   What are the goals of GSA's personal property regulations?

#### § § 102-35.15

      The goals of GSA's personal property regulations are to:

      (a) Improve the identification and reporting of excess personal property;

      (b) Maximize the use of excess property as the first source of supply to minimize expenditures for the purchase of new property, when practicable;

      (c) Achieve maximum public benefit from the use of Government property through the donation of surplus personal property to State and local public agencies and other eligible non-Federal recipients;

      (d) Obtain the optimum monetary return to the Government for surplus personal property sold and personal property sold under the exchange/sale authority; and

      (e) Reduce management and inventory costs by appropriate use of the abandonment/destruction authority to dispose of unneeded personal property that has no commercial value or for which the estimated cost of continued care and handling would exceed the estimated sales proceeds (see FMR §§ 102-36.305 through 102-36.330).

      § 102-35.20   What definitions apply to GSA's personal property regulations?

#### § § 102-35.20

      The following are definitions of, or cross-references to, some key terms that apply to GSA's personal property regulations in the FMR (CFR parts 102-36 through 102-42). Other personal property terms are defined in the sections or parts to which they primarily apply.

      includes nonexpendable personal property whose expected useful life is two years or longer and whose acquisition value, as determined by the agency, warrants tracking in the agency's property records, including capitalized and sensitive personal property.

      means the ability to account for personal property by providing a complete audit trail for property transactions from receipt to final disposition.

      means the original purchase price of an item.

      includes property that is entered on the agency's general ledger records as a major investment or asset. An agency must determine its capitalization thresholds as discussed in Financial Accounting Standard Advisory Board (FASAB) Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 6 Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment, Chapter 1, paragraph 13.

      means the ongoing function of maintaining physical oversight and surveillance of personal property throughout its complete life cycle using various property management tools and techniques taking into account the environment in which the property is located and its vulnerability to theft, waste, fraud, or abuse.

      (see § 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).

      (see § 102-39.20 of this subchapter B).

      (see § 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).

      (see § 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).

      (for the definition of relevant terms, see § 102-42.10 of this subchapter B).

      (see § 102-41.20 of this subchapter B).

      includes a formal listing of all accountable property items assigned to an agency, along with a formal process to verify the condition, location, and quantity of such items. This term may also be used as a verb to indicate the actions leading to the development of a listing. In this sense, an inventory must be conducted using an actual physical count, electronic means, and/or statistical methods.

      means an official, designated in accordance with § 102-36.45(b) of this subchapter B, who is responsible for ensuring effective acquisition, use, and disposal of excess property within your agency.

      (see § 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).

      means the system of acquiring, maintaining, using and disposing of the personal property of an organization or entity.

      means personal property that has been confiscated by a Federal agency, and whose care and handling will be the responsibility of that agency until final ownership is determined by the judicial process.

      includes all items, regardless of value, that require special control and accountability due to unusual rates of loss, theft or misuse, or due to national security or export control considerations. Such property includes weapons, ammunition, explosives, information technology equipment with memory capability, cameras, and communications equipment. These classifications do not preclude agencies from specifying additional personal property classifications to effectively manage their programs.

      (see § 102-37.25 of this subchapter B).

      means the identification, reporting, and transfer of excess personal property among Federal agencies.

      § 102-35.25   What management reports must we provide?

#### § § 102-35.25

      (a) There are three reports that must be provided. The report summarizing the property provided to non-Federal recipients and the report summarizing exchange/sale transactions (see §§ 102-36.295 and 102-39.75 respectively of this subchapter B) must be provided every year (negative reports are required). In addition, if you conduct negotiated sales of surplus personal property valued over $5,000 in any year, you must report this transaction in accordance with § 102-38.115 (negative reports are not required for this report).

      (b) The General Services Administration (GSA) may request other reports as authorized by 40 U.S.C. 506(a)(1)(A).

      § 102-35.30   What actions must I take or am I authorized to take regardless of the property disposition method?

#### § § 102-35.30

      Regardless of the disposition method used:

      (a) You must maintain property in a safe, secure, and cost-effective manner until final disposition.

      (b) You have authority to use the abandonment/ destruction provisions at any stage of the disposal process (see §§ 102-36.305 through 102-36.330 and § 102-38.70 of this subchapter B).

      (c) You must implement policies and procedures to remove sensitive or classified information from property prior to disposal. Agency-affixed markings should be removed, if at all possible, prior to personal property permanently leaving your agency's control.

      (d) Government-owned personal property may only be used as authorized by your agency. Title to Government-owned personal property cannot be transferred to a non-Federal entity unless through official procedures specifically authorized by law.

        § 102-36.15   Who must comply with the provisions of this part?

#### § § 102-36.15

        All executive agencies must comply with the provisions of this part. The legislative and judicial branches are encouraged to report and transfer excess personal property and fill their personal property requirements from excess in accordance with these provisions.

        § 102-36.20   To whom do “we”, “you”, and their variants refer?

#### § § 102-36.20

        Use of pronouns “we”, “you”, and their variants throughout this part refer to the agency.

        § 102-36.25   How do we request a deviation from these requirements and who can approve it?

#### § § 102-36.25

        See §§ 102-2.60 through 102-2.110 of this chapter to request a deviation from the requirements of this part.

        § 102-36.30   When is personal property excess?

#### § § 102-36.30

        Personal property is excess when it is no longer needed by the activities within your agency to carry out the functions of official programs, as determined by the agency head or designee.

        § 102-36.35   What is the typical process for disposing of excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.35

        (a) You must ensure personal property not needed by your activity is offered for use elsewhere within your agency. If the property is no longer needed by any activity within your agency, your agency declares the property excess and reports it to GSA for possible transfer to eligible recipients, including federal agencies for direct use or for use by their contractors, project grantees, or cooperative agreement recipients. All executive agencies must, to the maximum extent practicable, fill requirements for personal property by using existing agency property or by obtaining excess property from other federal agencies in lieu of new procurements.

        (b) If GSA determines that there are no federal requirements for your excess personal property, it becomes surplus property and is available for donation to state and local public agencies and other eligible non-federal activities. Title 40 of the United States Code requires that surplus personal property be distributed to eligible recipients by an agency established by each State for this purpose, the State Agency for Surplus Property.

        (c) Surplus personal property not selected for donation is offered for sale to the public by competitive offerings such as sealed bid sales, spot bid sales, or auctions. You may conduct or contract for the sale of your surplus personal property, or have GSA or another executive agency conduct the sale on behalf of your agency in accordance with part 102-38 of this chapter. You must inform GSA at the time the property is reported as excess if you do not want GSA to conduct the sale for you.

        (d) If a written determination is made that the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, you may dispose of the property by abandonment or destruction, or donate it to public bodies.

          § 102-36.65   Why must we use excess personal property instead of buying new property?

#### § § 102-36.65

          Using excess personal property to the maximum extent practicable maximizes the return on government dollars spent and minimizes expenditures for new procurement. Before purchasing new property, check with the appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office or access GSAXcess ® for any available excess personal property that may be suitable for your needs. You must use excess personal property unless it would cause serious hardship, be impractical, or impair your operations.

> [65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]

          § 102-36.70   What must we consider when acquiring excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.70

          Consider the following when acquiring excess personal property:

          (a) There must be an authorized requirement.

          (b) The cost of acquiring and maintaining the excess personal property (including packing, shipping, pickup, and necessary repairs) does not exceed the cost of purchasing and maintaining new material.

          (c) The sources of spare parts or repair/maintenance services to support the acquired item are readily accessible.

          (d) The supply of excess parts acquired must not exceed the life expectancy of the equipment supported.

          (e) The excess personal property will fulfill the required need with reasonable certainty without sacrificing mission or schedule.

          (f) You must not acquire excess personal property with the intent to sell or trade for other assets.

          § 102-36.75   Do we pay for excess personal property we acquire from another federal agency under a transfer?

#### § § 102-36.75

          (a) No, except for the situations listed in paragraph (b) of this section, you do not pay for the property. However, you are responsible for shipping and transportation costs. Where applicable, you may also be required to pay packing, loading, and any costs directly related to the dismantling of the property when required for the purpose of transporting the property.

          (b) You may be required to reimburse the holding agency for excess personal property transferred to you (i.e., transfer with reimbursement) when:

          (1) Reimbursement is directed by GSA.

          (2) The property was originally acquired with funds not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue and the holding agency requests reimbursement. It is executive branch policy that working capital fund property shall be transferred without reimbursement.

          (3) The property was acquired with appropriated funds, but reimbursement is required or authorized by law.

          (4) You or the holding agency is the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

          (5) You are acquiring excess personal property for use by a project grantee that is a public agency or a nonprofit organization and exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501.

          (6) You or the holding agency is the DC Government.

          (7) You or the holding agency is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership government corporation as defined in the Government Corporation Control Act (31 U.S.C. 9101-9110).

          § 102-36.80   How much do we pay for excess personal property on a transfer with reimbursement?

#### § § 102-36.80

          (a) You may be required to reimburse the holding agency the fair market value when the transfer involves any of the conditions in § 102-36.75(b)(1) through (b)(4).

          (b) When acquiring excess personal property for your project grantees (§ 102-36.75(b)(5)), you are required to deposit into the miscellaneous receipts fund of the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to 25 percent of the original acquisition cost of the property, except for transfers under the conditions cited in § 102-36.190.

          (c) When you or the holding agency is the DC Government or a wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation (§ 102-36.75(b)(6) or (b)(7)), you are required to reimburse the holding agency using fair value reimbursement. Fair value reimbursement is 20 percent of the original acquisition cost for new or unused property (i.e., condition code 1), and zero percent for other personal property. Where circumstances warrant, a higher fair value may be used if the agencies concerned agree. Due to special circumstances or the unusual nature of the property, the holding agency may use other criteria for establishing fair value if approved or directed by GSA. You must refer any disagreements to the appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office.

          § 102-36.85   Do we pay for personal property we acquire when it is disposed of by another agency under the exchange/sale authority, and how much do we pay?

#### § § 102-36.85

          Yes, you must pay for personal property disposed of under the exchange/sale authority, in the amount required by the holding agency. The amount of reimbursement is normally the fair market value.

        Screening of Excess

          § 102-36.90   How do we find out what personal property is available as excess?

#### § § 102-36.90

          You may use the following methods to find out what excess personal property is available:

          (c) Retrieve any expired or invalid screener's authorization forms.

        Processing Transfers

          § 102-36.125   How do we process a Standard Form 122 (SF 122), Transfer Order Excess Personal Property, through GSA?

      Subpart C—Acquiring Excess Personal Property for Non-Federal Recipients

        Non-appropriated Fund Activities

          § 102-36.165   Do we retain title to excess personal property furnished to a non-appropriated fund activity within our agency?

#### § § 102-36.165

          Yes, title to excess personal property furnished to a non-appropriated fund activity remains with the Federal Government and you are accountable for establishing controls over the use of such excess property in accordance with § 102-36.45(d). When such property is no longer required by the non-appropriated fund activity, you must reuse or dispose of the property in accordance with this part.

          § 102-36.170   May we transfer personal property owned by one of our non-appropriated fund activities?

#### § § 102-36.170

          Property purchased by a non-appropriated fund activity is not federal property. A non-appropriated fund activity has the option of making its privately owned personal property available for transfer to a federal agency, usually with reimbursement. If such reimbursable personal property is not transferred to another federal agency, it may be offered for sale. Such property is not available for donation.

> [65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 33778, May 25, 2000]

        Contractors

          § 102-36.180   Is there any limitation/condition to acquiring excess personal property for use by cooperatives?

#### § § 102-36.180

          Yes, you must limit the total dollar amount of property transfers (in terms of original acquisition cost) to the dollar value of the cooperative agreement. For any transfers in excess of such amount, you must ensure that an official of your agency at a level higher than the officer administering the agreement approves the transfer. The federal government retains title to such property, except when provided by specific statutory authority.

        Project Grantees

          § 102-36.185   What are the requirements for acquiring excess personal property for use by our grantees?

#### § § 102-36.185

          You may furnish excess personal property for use by your grantees only when:

          (a) The grantee holds a federally sponsored project grant;

          (b) The grantee is a public agency or a nonprofit tax-exempt organization under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);

          (c) The property is for use in connection with the grant; and

          (d) You pay 25 percent of the original acquisition cost of the excess personal property, such funds to be deposited into the miscellaneous receipts fund of the U.S. Treasury. Exceptions to paying this 25 percent are provided in § 102-36.190. Title to property vests in the grantee when your agency pays 25 percent of the original acquisition cost.

          § 102-36.190   Must we always pay 25 percent of the original acquisition cost when furnishing excess personal property to project grantees?

#### § § 102-36.190

          No, you may acquire excess personal property for use by a project grantee without paying the 25 percent fee when any of the following conditions apply:

          (a) The personal property was originally acquired from excess sources by your agency and has been placed into official use by your agency for at least one year. The federal government retains title to such property.

          (b) The property is furnished under section 203 of the Department of Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 (16 U.S.C. 580a) through the U.S. Forest Service in connection with cooperative state forest fire control programs. The federal government retains title to such property.

          (c) The property is furnished by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to state or county extension services or agricultural research cooperatives under 40 U.S.C. 483(d)(2)(E). The federal government retains title to such property.

Title to such property transfers to the grantee. (You need not wait until after the donation screening period when furnishing excess personal property to recipients under the Agency for International Development (AID) Development Loan Program.)

          (e) The property is scientific equipment transferred under section 11(e) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Act of 1950, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1870(e)). GSA will limit such transfers to property within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups 12, 14, 43, 48, 58, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 70. GSA may approve transfers without reimbursement for property under other FSC groups when NSF certifies the item is a component of or related to a piece of scientific equipment or is a difficult-to-acquire item needed for scientific research. Regardless of FSC, GSA will not approve transfers of common-use or general-purpose items without reimbursement. Title to such property transfers to the grantee.

          (f) The property is furnished in connection with grants to Indian tribes, as defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act (24 U.S.C. 1452(c)). Title passage is determined under the authorities of the administering agency.

#### § § 102-36.195

          You may furnish to your project grantees any property, except for consumable items, determined to be necessary and usable for the purpose of the grant. Consumable items are generally not transferable to project grantees. GSA may approve transfers of excess consumable items when adequate justification for the transfer accompanies such requests. For the purpose of this section, “consumable items” are items which are intended for one-time use and are actually consumed in that one time; e.g., drugs, medicines, surgical dressings, cleaning and preserving materials, and fuels.

          § 102-36.200   May we acquire excess personal property for cannibalization purposes by the grantees?

#### § § 102-36.200

          Yes, subject to GSA approval, you may acquire excess personal property for cannibalization purposes. You may be required to provide a supporting statement that indicates disassembly of the item for secondary use has greater benefit than utilization of the item in its existing form and cost savings to the government will result.

          § 102-36.205   Is there a limit to how much excess personal property we may furnish to our grantees?

#### § § 102-36.205

          Yes, you must monitor transfers of excess personal property so the total dollar amount of property transferred (in original acquisition cost) does not exceed the dollar value of the grant. Any transfers above the grant amount must be approved by an official at an administrative level higher than the officer administering the grant.

        § 102-36.150   For which non-federal activities may we acquire excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.150

        Under the Property Act you may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by your non-appropriated fund activities, contractors, cooperatives, and project grantees. You may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by other eligible recipients only when you have specific statutory authority to do so.

        § 102-36.155   What are our responsibilities when acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-federal recipient?

#### § § 102-36.155

        When acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-federal recipient, your authorized agency official must:

        (a) Ensure the use of excess personal property by the non-federal recipient is authorized and complies with applicable federal regulations and agency guidelines.

        (b) Determine that the use of excess personal property will reduce the costs to the government and/or that it is in the government's best interest to furnish excess personal property.

        (c) Review and approve transfer documents for excess personal property as the sponsoring Federal agency.

        (d) Ensure the non-federal recipient is aware of their obligations under the FMR and your agency regulations regarding the management of excess personal property.

        (e) Ensure the non-federal recipient does not stockpile the property but places the property into use within a reasonable period of time, and has a system to prevent nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal or destruction of excess personal property furnished.

        (f) Establish provisions and procedures for property accountability and disposition in situations when the government retains title.

        (g) Report annually to GSA excess personal property furnished to non-federal recipients during the year (see § 102-36.295).

        § 102-36.160   What additional information must we provide on the SF 122 when acquiring excess personal property for non-federal recipients?

#### § § 102-36.160

        Annotate on the SF 122, the name of the non-federal recipient and the contract, grant or agreement number, when applicable, and the scheduled completion/expiration date of the contract, grant or agreement.

#### § § 102-36.240

          The disposal condition codes are contained in the following table:

        Disposing of Excess Personal Property

          § 102-36.245   Are we accountable for the personal property that has been reported excess, and who is responsible for the care and handling costs?

#### § § 102-36.245

          Yes, you are accountable for the excess personal property until the time it is picked up by the designated recipient or its agent. You are responsible for all care and handling charges while the excess personal property is going through the screening and disposal process.

          § 102-36.250   Does GSA ever take physical custody of excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.250

          Generally you retain physical custody of the excess personal property prior to its final disposition. Very rarely GSA may consider accepting physical custody of excess personal property. Under special circumstances, GSA may take custody or may direct the transfer of partial or total custody to other executive agencies, with their consent.

          § 102-36.255   What options do we have when unusual circumstances do not allow adequate time for disposal through GSA?

#### § § 102-36.255

          Contact your regional GSA Personal Property Management office for any existing interagency agreements that would allow you to turn in excess personal property to a federal facility. You are responsible for any turn in costs and all costs related to transporting the excess personal property to these facilities.

          § 102-36.260   How do we promote the expeditious transfer of excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.260

          For expeditious transfer of excess personal property you should:

          (a) Provide complete and accurate property descriptions and condition codes on the report of excess to facilitate the selection of usable property by potential users.

          (b) Ensure that any available operating manual, parts list, diagram, maintenance log, or other instructional publication is made available with the property at the time of transfer.

          (c) Advise the designated recipient of any special requirements for dismantling, shipping/transportation.

          (d) When the excess personal property is located at a facility due to be closed, provide advance notice of the scheduled date of closing, and ensure there is sufficient time for screening and removal of property.

          § 102-36.265   What if there are competing requests for the same excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.265

          (a) GSA will generally approve transfers on a first-come, first-served basis. When more than one federal agency requests the same item, and the quantity available is not sufficient to meet the demand of all interested agencies, GSA will consider factors such as national defense requirements, emergency needs, avoiding the necessity of a new procurement, energy conservation, transportation costs, and retention of title in the government. GSA will normally give preference to the agency that will retain title in the Government.

          (b) Requests for property for the purpose of cannibalization will normally be subordinate to requests for use of the property in its existing form.

          § 102-36.270   What if a federal agency requests personal property that is undergoing donation screening or in the sales process?

#### § § 102-36.270

          Prior to final disposition, GSA will consider requests from authorized federal activities for excess personal property undergoing donation screening or in the sales process. Federal transfers may be authorized prior to removal of the property under a donation or sales action.

          § 102-36.275   May we dispose of excess personal property without GSA approval?

          (b) You may dispose of excess personal property that is not required to be reported to GSA (see § 102-36.220(b)).

          (c) You may dispose of excess personal property without going through GSA when such disposal is authorized by law.

          § 102-36.280   May we withdraw from the disposal process excess personal property that we have reported to GSA?

#### § § 102-36.280

          Yes, you may withdraw excess personal property from the disposal process, but only with the approval of GSA and to satisfy an internal agency requirement. Property that has been approved for transfer or donation or offered for sale by GSA may be returned to your control with proper justification.

        Transfers With Reimbursement

          § 102-36.285   May we charge for personal property transferred to another federal agency?

#### § § 102-36.285

          (a) When any one of the following conditions applies, you may require and retain reimbursement for the excess personal property from the recipient:

          (1) Your agency has the statutory authority to require and retain reimbursement for the property.

          (2) You are transferring the property under the exchange/sale authority.

          (3) You had originally acquired the property with funds not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue. It is current executive branch policy that working capital fund property shall be transferred without reimbursement.

          (4) You or the recipient is the U.S. Postal Service.

          (5) You or the recipient is the DC Government.

          (6) You or the recipient is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership government corporation.

          (b) You may charge for direct costs you incurred incident to the transfer, such as packing, loading and shipping of the property. The recipient is responsible for such charges unless you waive the amount involved.

          (c) You may not charge for overhead or administrative expenses or the costs for care and handling of the property pending disposition.

          § 102-36.290   How much do we charge for excess personal property on a transfer with reimbursement?

#### § § 102-36.290

          (a) You may require reimbursement in an amount up to the fair market value of the property when the transfer involves property meeting conditions in § 102-36.285(a)(1) through (a)(4).

          (b) When you or the recipient is the DC Government or a wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation (§ 102-36.285(a)(5) and (a)(6)), you may only require fair value reimbursement. Fair value reimbursement is 20 percent of the original acquisition cost for new or unused property (i.e., condition code 1), and zero percent for other personal property. A higher fair value may be used if you and the recipient agency agree. Due to special circumstances or the nature of the property, you may use other criteria for establishing fair value if approved or directed by GSA. You must refer any disagreements to the appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office.

        Abandonment/Destruction

          § 102-36.305   May we abandon or destroy excess personal property without reporting it to GSA?

#### § § 102-36.305

          Yes, you may abandon or destroy excess personal property when you have made a written determination that the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. An item has no commercial value when it has neither utility nor monetary value (either as an item or as scrap).

          § 102-36.310   Who makes the determination to abandon or destroy excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.310

          To abandon or destroy excess personal property, an authorized official of your agency makes a written finding that must be approved by a reviewing official who is not directly accountable for the property.

          § 102-36.315   Are there any restrictions to the use of the abandonment/destruction authority?

#### § § 102-36.315

          Yes, the following restrictions apply:

          (a) You must not abandon or destroy property in a manner which is detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety. Additional guidelines for the abandonment/destruction of hazardous materials are prescribed in part 101-42 of this title.

          § 102-36.320   May we transfer or donate excess personal property that has been determined appropriate for abandonment/destruction without GSA approval?

#### § § 102-36.320

          In lieu of abandonment/destruction, you may donate such excess personal property only to a public body without going through GSA. A public body is any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a state or local government; any Indian tribe; or any agency of the federal government. If you become aware of an interest from an eligible non-profit organization (see part 102-37 of this chapter) that is not a public body in acquiring the property, you must contact the regional GSA Personal Property Management office and implement donation procedures in accordance with part 102-37 of this chapter.

          § 102-36.325   What must be done before the abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.325

          Except as provided in § 102-36.330, you must provide public notice of intent to abandon or destroy excess personal property, in a format and timeframe specified by your agency regulations (such as publishing a notice in a local newspaper, posting of signs in common use facilities available to the public, or providing bulletins on your website through the internet). You must also include in the notice an offer to sell in accordance with part 102-38 of this chapter.

          § 102-36.330   Are there occasions when public notice is not needed regarding abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

#### § § 102-36.330

          Yes, you are not required to provide public notice when:

          (a) The value of the property is so little or the cost of its care and handling, pending abandonment/destruction, is so great that its retention for advertising for sale, even as scrap, is clearly not economical;

          (b) Abandonment or destruction is required because of health, safety, or security reasons; or

          (c) When the original acquisition cost of the item (estimated if unknown) is less than $500.

        § 102-36.210   Why must we report excess personal property to GSA?

#### § § 102-36.210

        You must report excess personal property to promote reuse by the government to enable federal agencies to benefit from the continued use of property already paid for with taxpayers' money, thus minimizing new procurement costs. Reporting excess personal property to GSA helps assure that the information on available excess personal property is accessible and disseminated to the widest range of reuse customers.

          § 102-36.345   May we dispose of excess Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP)?

#### § § 102-36.345

          Yes, you may dispose of excess FSCAP, but first you must determine whether the documentation available is adequate to allow transfer, donation, or sale of the part in accordance with part 102-33, subpart D, of this chapter. Otherwise, you must mutilate undocumented FSCAP that has no traceability to its original equipment manufacturer and dispose of it as scrap. When reporting excess FSCAP, annotate the manufacturer, date of manufacture, part number, serial number, and the appropriate Criticality Code on the SF 120, and ensure that all available historical and maintenance records accompany the part at the time of issue.

> [65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]

          § 102-36.350   How do we identify a FSCAP?

#### § § 102-36.350

          Any aircraft part designated as FSCAP is assigned an alpha Criticality Code, and the code is annotated on the original transfer document when you acquire the part. You must perpetuate the appropriate FSCAP Criticality Code on all personal property records. You may contact the Federal agency or Military service that originally owned the part for assistance in making this determination, or query DOD's Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) using the National Stock Number (NSN) for the part. For assistance in subscribing to the FLIS service contact the FedLog Consumer Support Office, 800-351-4381.

          § 102-36.370   Are there special requirements concerning the use of excess personal property for disaster relief?

#### § § 102-36.370

          Yes, upon declaration by the President of an emergency or a major disaster, you may loan excess personal property to state and local governments, with or without compensation and prior to reporting it as excess to GSA, to alleviate suffering and damage resulting from any emergency or major disaster (Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121-5206) and Executive Order 12148 (3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 412), as amended). If the loan involves property that has already been reported excess to GSA, you may withdraw the item from the disposal process subject to approval by GSA. You may also withdraw excess personal property for use by your agency in providing assistance in disaster relief. You are still accountable for this property and your agency is responsible for developing agencywide procedures for recovery of such property.

          § 102-36.410   How do we dispose of a gift in the form of money or intangible personal property?

#### § § 102-36.410

          Report intangible personal property to GSA, Personal Property Management Division (FBP), Washington, DC 20406. You must not transfer or dispose of this property without prior approval of GSA. The Secretary of the Treasury will dispose of money and negotiable instruments such as bonds, notes, or other securities under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 324.

          § 102-36.415   How do we dispose of gifts other than intangible personal property?

#### § § 102-36.415

          (a) When the gift is offered with the condition that the property be sold and the proceeds used to reduce the public debt, report the gift to the regional GSA Personal Property Management office in which the property is located. GSA will convert the gift to money upon acceptance and deposit the proceeds into a special account of the U.S. Treasury.

          (b) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, and your agency has gift retention authority, you may use the gift for an authorized official purpose without reporting to GSA.

When the property is no longer needed, you must report it as excess personal property to GSA.

          (c) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, but your agency does not have gift retention authority, you must report it to the regional GSA Personal Property Management office. GSA will offer the property for screening for possible transfer to a federal agency or convert the gift to money and deposit the funds with U.S. Treasury. If your agency is interested in keeping the gift for an official purpose, you must annotate your interest on the SF 120 and also submit a SF 122.

          You may dispose of excess MLIs/CCLIs only when you comply with the additional disposal and demilitarization (DEMIL) requirements contained in part 101-42 of this title. MLIs may require demilitarization when issued to any non-DoD entity, and will require appropriate licensing when exported from the U.S. CCLIs usually require export licensing when transported from the U.S.

          § 102-36.435   How do we identify Munitions List Items (MLIs)/Commerce Control List Items (CCLIs) requiring demilitarization?

#### § § 102-36.435

          You identify MLIs/CCLIs requiring demilitarization by the demilitarization code that is assigned to each MLI or CCLI.

        Red Cross Property

          § 102-36.445   Do we report excess personal property originally acquired from or through the American National Red Cross?

#### § § 102-36.445

          Yes, when reporting excess personal property which was processed, produced, or donated by the American National Red Cross, note “RED CROSS PROPERTY” on the SF 120 or report document. GSA will offer to return this property to the Red Cross if no other federal agency has a need for it. If the Red Cross has no requirement, the property continues in the disposal process and is available for donation.

        Shelf-Life Items

          § 102-36.450   Do we report excess shelf-life items?

#### § § 102-36.450

          (a) When there are quantities on hand, that would not be utilized by the expiration date and cannot be returned to the vendor for credit, you must report such expected overage as excess for possible transfer and disposal to ensure maximum use prior to deterioration.

          (b) You need not report expired shelf-life items. You may dispose of property with expired shelf-life by abandonment/destruction in accordance with § 102-36.305 and in compliance with Federal, State, and local waste disposal and air and water pollution control standards.

          § 102-36.455   How do we report excess shelf-life items?

#### § § 102-36.455

          You must identify the property as shelf-life items by “SL”, indicate the expiration date, whether the date is the original or an extended date, and if the date is further extendable. GSA may adjust the screening period based on re-use potential and the remaining useful shelf life.

          § 102-36.460   Do we report excess medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes?

#### § § 102-36.460

          When the remaining shelf life of any medical materials or supplies held for national emergency purposes is of too short a period to justify their continued retention, you should report such property excess for possible transfer and disposal. You must make such excess determinations at such time as to ensure that sufficient time remains to permit their use before their shelf-life expires and the items are unfit for human use. You must identify such items with “MSL” and the expiration date, and indicate any specialized storage requirements.

          § 102-36.465   May we transfer or exchange excess medical shelf-life items with other federal agencies?

#### § § 102-36.465

          Yes, you may transfer or exchange excess medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes with any other federal agency for other medical materials or supplies, without GSA approval and without regard to part 102-39 of this chapter. You and the transferee agency will agree to the terms and prices. You may credit any proceeds derived from such transactions to your agency's current applicable appropriation and use the funds only for the purchase of medical materials or supplies for national emergency purposes.

#### § § 102-36.475

        (a) The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), authorizes federal agencies to transfer excess education-related federal equipment to educational institutions or nonprofit organizations for educational and research activities.

        (b) Each federal agency is required to identify a point of contact within the agency to assist eligible recipients, and to publicize the availability of such property to eligible communities. Excess education-related equipment may be transferred directly under established agency procedures, or reported to GSA as excess for subsequent transfer to potential eligible recipients as appropriate. You must include transfers under this authority in the annual Non-federal Recipients Report (See § 102-36.295) to GSA.

        (c) The “Computers for Learning” website has been developed to streamline the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to schools and nonprofit educational organizations. For additional information about this program access the “Computers for Learning” website,

        Donation Overview

          § 102-37.30   When does property become available for donation?

#### § § 102-37.30

          Excess personal property becomes available for donation the day following the surplus release date. This is the point at which the screening period has been completed without transfer to a Federal agency or other eligible recipient, and the GSA has determined the property to be surplus.

          § 102-37.35   Who handles the donation of surplus property?

#### § § 102-37.35

          (a) The SASPs handle the donation of most surplus property to eligible donees in their States in accordance with this part.

          (b) The GSA handles the donation of surplus property to public airports under a program administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (see subpart F of this part).

          (g) Property that requires reimbursement upon transfer (such as abandoned or other unclaimed property that is found on premises owned or leased by the Government).

          (h) Controlled substances.

          (i) Items as may be specified from time to time by the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy.

          § 102-37.45   How long is property available for donation screening?

#### § § 102-37.45

          Entities authorized to participate in the donation program may screen property, concurrently with Federal agencies, as soon as the property is reported as excess up until the surplus release date. The screening period is normally 21 calendar days, except as noted in § 102-36.95 of this chapter.

          § 102-37.50   What is the general process for requesting surplus property for donation?

          (b) SASPs and public airports should submit their requests to the appropriate GSA regional office. Requests must be submitted on a Standard Form (SF) 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, or its electronic equivalent. Public airports must have FAA certify their transfer requests prior to submission to GSA for approval. GSA may ask SASPs or public airports to submit any additional information required to support and justify transfer of the property.

          (c) The American National Red Cross should submit requests to GSA as described in subpart G of this part when obtaining property under the authority of 40 U.S.C. 551.

          § 102-37.55   Who pays for transportation and other costs associated with a donation?

#### § § 102-37.55

          The receiving organization (the transferee) is responsible for any packing, shipping, or transportation charges associated with the transfer of surplus property for donation. Those costs, in the case of SASPs, may be passed on to donees that receive the property.

          § 102-37.60   How much time does a transferee have to pick up or remove surplus property from holding agency premises?

#### § § 102-37.60

          The transferee (or the transferee's agent) must remove property from the holding agency premises within 15 calendar days after being notified that the property is available for pickup, unless otherwise coordinated with the holding agency. If the transferee decides prior to pickup or removal that it no longer needs the property, it must notify the GSA regional office that approved the transfer request.

          § 102-37.65   What happens to surplus property that has been approved for transfer when the prospective transferee decides it cannot use the property and declines to pick it up?

#### § § 102-37.65

          When a prospective transferee decides it cannot use surplus property that has already been approved for transfer and declines to pick it up, the GSA regional office will advise any other SASP or public airport known to be interested in the property to submit a transfer request. If there is no transfer interest, GSA will release the property for other disposal.

          § 102-37.70   How should a transferee account for the receipt of a larger or smaller number of items than approved by GSA on the SF 123?

#### § § 102-37.70

          When the quantity of property received doesn't agree with that approved by GSA on the SF 123, the transferee should handle the overage or shortage as follows:

          § 102-37.75   What should be included in a shortage report?

#### § § 102-37.75

          The shortage report should include:

          (a) The name and address of the holding agency;

          (b) All pertinent GSA and holding agency control numbers, in addition to the original transfer order number; and

          (c) A description of each line item of property, the condition code, the quantity and unit of issue, and the unit and total acquisition cost.

          § 102-37.80   What happens to surplus property that isn't transferred for donation?

#### § § 102-37.80

          Surplus property not transferred for donation is generally offered for sale under the provisions of part 102-38 of this chapter. Under the appropriate circumstances (see § 102-36.305 of this chapter), such property might be abandoned or destroyed.

> [67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]

          § 102-37.85   Can surplus property being offered for sale be withdrawn and approved for donation?

#### § § 102-37.85

          Yes, surplus property being offered for sale may be withdrawn for donation if approved by GSA. GSA will not approve requests for the withdrawal of property that has been advertised or listed on a sales offering if that withdrawal would be harmful to the overall outcome of the sale. GSA will only grant such requests prior to sales award, since an award is binding.

        § 102-37.5   What does this part cover?

#### § § 102-37.5

        This part covers the donation of surplus Federal personal property located within a State, including foreign excess personal property returned to a State for handling as surplus property. For purposes of this part, the term State includes any of the 50 States, as well as the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        § 102-37.10   What is the primary governing authority for this part?

#### § § 102-37.10

        § 102-37.15   Who must comply with the provisions of this part?

#### § § 102-37.15

        You must comply with this part if you are a holding agency or a recipient of Federal surplus personal property approved by GSA for donation (e.g., a State agency for surplus property (SASP) or a public airport).

        § 102-37.20   How do we request a deviation from this part and who can approve it?

#### § § 102-37.20

        See §§ 102-2.60 through 102-2.110 of this chapter to request a deviation from the requirements of this part.

      Subpart B—General Services Administration (GSA)

        § 102-37.90   What are GSA's responsibilities in the donation of surplus property?

#### § § 102-37.90

        The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for supervising and directing the disposal of surplus personal property. In addition to issuing regulatory guidance for the donation of such property, GSA:

        (a) Determines when property is surplus to the needs of the Government;

        (b) Allocates and transfers surplus property on a fair and equitable basis to State agencies for surplus property (SASPs) for further distribution to eligible donees;

        (c) Oversees the care and handling of surplus property while it is in the custody of a SASP;

        (d) Approves all transfers of surplus property to public airports, pursuant to the appropriate determinations made by the Federal Aviation Administration (see subpart F of this part);

        (e) Donates to the American National Red Cross property (generally blood plasma and related medical materials) originally provided by the Red Cross to a Federal agency, but that has subsequently been determined surplus to Federal needs (see subpart G of this part);

        (f) Approves, after consultation with the holding agency, foreign excess personal property to be returned to the United States for donation purposes;

        (g) Coordinates and controls the level of SASP and donee screening at Federal installations;

        (h) Imposes appropriate conditions on the donation of surplus property having characteristics that require special handling or use limitations (see § 102-37.455); and

        (i) Keeps track of and reports on Federal donation programs (see § 102-37.105).

        § 102-37.95   How will GSA resolve competing transfer requests?

#### § § 102-37.95

        In case of requests from two or more SASPs, GSA will use the allocating criteria in § 102-37.100. When competing requests are received from public airports and SASPs, GSA will transfer property fairly and equitably, based on such factors as need, proposed use, and interest of the holding agency in having the property donated to a specific public airport.

        § 102-37.100   What factors will GSA consider in allocating surplus property among SASPs?

#### § § 102-37.100

        GSA allocates property among the SASPs on a fair and equitable basis using the following factors:

        (a) Extraordinary needs caused by disasters or emergency situations.

        (b) Requests from the Department of Defense (DOD) for DOD-generated property to be allocated through a SASP for donation to a specific service educational activity.

        (c) Need and usability of property, as reflected by requests from SASPs. GSA will also give special consideration to requests transmitted through the SASPs by eligible donees for specific items of property. (Requests for property to be used as is will be given preference over cannibalization requests.)

        (d) States in greatest need of the type of property to be allocated where the need is evidenced by a letter of justification from the intended donee.

        (e) Whether a SASP has already received similar property in the past, and how much.

        (f) Past performance of a SASP in effecting timely pickup or removal of property approved for transfer and making prompt distribution of property to eligible donees.

        (g) The property's condition and its original acquisition cost.

        (h) Relative neediness of each State based on the State's population and per capita income.

      Subpart C—Holding Agency

        § 102-37.110   What are a holding agency's responsibilities in the donation of surplus property?

#### § § 102-37.110

        Your donation responsibilities as a holding agency begin when you determine that property is to be declared excess. You must then:

        (a) Let GSA know if you have a donee in mind for foreign gift items or airport property, as provided for in §§ 102-37.525 and 102-42.95(h) of this chapter;

        (c) Set aside or hold surplus property from further disposal upon notification of a pending transfer for donation; (If GSA does not notify you of a pending transfer within 5 calendar days following the surplus release date, you may proceed with the sale or other authorized disposal of the property.)

        (d) Upon receipt of a GSA-approved transfer document, promptly ship or release property to the transferee (or the transferee's designated agent) in accordance with pickup or shipping instructions on the transfer document;

        (e) Notify the approving GSA regional office if surplus property to be picked up is not removed within 15 calendar days after you notify the transferee (or its agent) of its availability. (GSA will advise you of further disposal instructions.); and

        (f) Perform and bear the cost of care and handling of surplus property pending its disposal, except as provided in § 102-37.115.

        § 102-37.115   May a holding agency be reimbursed for costs incurred incident to a donation?

#### § § 102-37.115

        Yes, you, as a holding agency, may charge the transferee for the direct costs you incurred incident to a donation transfer, such as your packing, handling, crating, and transportation expenses. However, you may not include overhead or administrative costs in these charges.

          (1) Your distribution document, signed and dated by the authorized donee representative; and

          (2) A conditional transfer document, signed by you and the intended donee, and containing the special terms and conditions prescribed by GSA.

          § 102-37.230   What must a letter of intent for obtaining surplus aircraft or vessels include?

If an aircraft is requested for cannibalization, the donee must provide details of the cannibalization process (time to complete the cannibalization process, how recovered parts are to be used, method of accounting for usable parts, disposition of unsalvageable parts, etc.) If a vessel is requested for waterway purposes, the donee must specify a source of pilot(s) and where the vessel will be docked. If a vessel is requested for permanent docking on water or land, the donee must provide details of the process, including the time to complete the process; and

          (d) Any supplemental information (such as geographical area and population served, number of students enrolled in educational programs, etc.) supporting the donee's need for the aircraft or vessel.

          § 102-37.235   What type of information must a SASP provide when requesting surplus property for cannibalization?

#### § § 102-37.235

          When a donee wants surplus property to cannibalize, include the following statement on the SF 123: “Line Item Number(s)___requested for cannibalization.”. In addition to including this statement, provide a detailed justification concerning the need for the components or accessories and an explanation of the effect removal will have on the item. GSA will approve requests for cannibalization only when it is clear from the justification that disassembly of the item for use of its component parts will provide greater potential benefit than use of the item in its existing form.

          § 102-37.240   How must a transfer request for surplus firearms be justified?

#### § § 102-37.240

          § 102-37.255   Must a SASP insure surplus property against loss or damage?

#### § § 102-37.255

          No, you are not required to carry insurance on Federal surplus property in your custody. However, if you elect to carry insurance and the insured property is lost or damaged, you must submit a check made payable to GSA for any insurance proceeds received in excess of your actual costs of acquiring and rehabilitating the property prior to its loss, damage, or destruction.

        Distribution of Property

          § 102-37.260   How must a SASP document the distribution of surplus property?

          Yes, you may distribute surplus property to eligible donees of another State, if you and the other SASP determine that such an arrangement will be of mutual benefit to you and the donees concerned. Where such determinations are made, an interstate distribution cooperative agreement must be prepared as prescribed in § 102-37.335 and submitted to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. When acting under an interstate distribution cooperative agreement, you must:

          (a) Require the donee recipient to execute the distribution documents of its home SASP; and

          (b) Forward copies of executed distribution documents to the donee's home SASP.

          § 102-37.270   May a SASP retain surplus property for its own use?

#### § § 102-37.270

          Yes, you can retain surplus property for use in operating the donation program, but only if you have a cooperative agreement with GSA that allows you to do so. You must obtain prior GSA approval before using any surplus property in the operation of the SASP. Make your needs known by submitting a listing of needed property to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. GSA will review the list to ensure that it is of the type and quantity of property that is reasonably needed and useful in performing SASP operations. GSA will notify you within 30 calendar days whether you may retain the property for use in your operations. Title to any surplus property GSA approves for your retention will vest in your SASP. You must maintain separate records for such property.

        Service and Handling Charges

          § 102-37.275   May a SASP accept personal checks and non-official payment methods in payment of service charges?

#### § § 102-37.275

          No, service charge payments must readily identify the donee institution as the payer (or the name of the parent organization when that organization pays the operational expenses of the donee). Personal checks, personal cashier checks, personal money orders, and personal credit cards are not acceptable.

          § 102-37.280   How may a SASP use service charge funds?

#### § § 102-37.280

          § 102-37.285   May a SASP use service charge funds to support non-SASP State activities and programs?

#### § § 102-37.285

          No, except as provided in § 102-37.495, you must use funds collected from service charges, or from other sources such as proceeds from sale of undistributed property or funds collected from compliance cases, solely for the operation of the SASP and the benefit of participating donees.

        Disposing of Undistributed Property

          § 102-37.290   What must a SASP do with surplus property it cannot donate?

#### § § 102-37.290

          (a) As soon as it becomes clear that you cannot donate the surplus property, you should first determine whether or not the property is usable.

          (1) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is not usable, you should seek GSA approval to abandon or destroy the property in accordance with § 102-37.320.

          (2) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is usable, you should immediately offer it to other SASPs. If other SASPs cannot use the property, you should promptly report it to GSA for redisposal (i.e., disposition through retransfer, sale, or other means).

          (b) Normally, any property not donated within a 1-year period should be processed in this manner.

          § 102-37.295   Must GSA approve a transfer between SASPs?

#### § § 102-37.295

          Yes, the requesting SASP must submit a SF 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, to the GSA regional office in which the releasing SASP is located. GSA will approve or disapprove the request within 30 calendar days of receipt of the transfer order.

          § 102-37.300   What information must a SASP provide GSA when reporting unneeded usable property for disposal?

#### § § 102-37.300

          When reporting unneeded usable property that is not required for transfer to another SASP, provide GSA with the:

          (a) Best possible description of each line item of property, its current condition code, quantity, unit and total acquisition cost, State serial number, demilitarization code, and any special handling conditions;

          (b) Date you received each line item of property listed; and

          (c) Certification of reimbursement requested under § 102-37.315.

          § 102-37.305   May a SASP act as GSA's agent in selling undistributed surplus property (either as usable property or scrap)?

#### § § 102-37.305

          Yes, you may act as GSA's agent in selling undistributed surplus property (either as usable property or scrap) if an established cooperative agreement with GSA permits such an action. You must notify GSA each time you propose to conduct a sale under the cooperative agreement. You may request approval to conduct a sale when reporting the property to GSA for disposal instructions. If no formal agreement exists, you may submit such an agreement at that time for approval.

          § 102-37.310   What must a proposal to sell undistributed surplus property include?

#### § § 102-37.310

          (a) Your request to sell undistributed surplus property must include:

          § 102-37.315   What costs may a SASP recover if undistributed surplus property is retransferred or sold?

#### § § 102-37.315

          (a) When undistributed surplus property is transferred to a Federal agency or another SASP, or disposed of by public sale, you are entitled to recoup:

          (1) Direct costs you initially paid to the Federal holding agency, including but not limited to, packing, preparation for shipment, and loading. You will not be reimbursed for actions following receipt of the property, including unloading, moving, repairing, preserving, or storage.

          (2) Transportation costs you incurred, but were not reimbursed by a donee, for initially moving the property from the Federal holding agency to your distribution facility or other point of receipt. You must document and certify the amount of reimbursement requested for these costs.

          (b) Reimbursable arrangements should be made prior to transfer of the property. In the case of a Federal transfer, GSA will secure agreement of the Federal agency to reimburse your authorized costs, and annotate the amount of reimbursement on the transfer document. You must coordinate and make arrangements for reimbursement when property is transferred to another SASP. If you and the receiving SASP cannot agree on an appropriate reimbursement charge, GSA will determine appropriate reimbursement. The receiving SASP must annotate the reimbursement amount on the transfer document prior to its being forwarded to GSA for approval.

          (c) When undistributed property is disposed of by public sale, GSA must approve the amount of sales proceeds you may receive to cover your costs. Generally, this will not exceed 50 percent of the total sales proceeds.

          § 102-37.320   Under what conditions may a SASP abandon or destroy undistributed surplus property?

#### § § 102-37.320

          (a) You may abandon or destroy undistributed surplus property when you have made a written finding that the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. The abandonment or destruction finding must be sent to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. You must include in the finding:

          (1) The basis for the abandonment or destruction;

          (2) A detailed description of the property, its condition, and total acquisition cost;

          (3) The proposed method of destruction (burning, burying, etc.) or the abandonment location;

          (4) A statement confirming that the proposed abandonment or destruction will not be detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety and will not infringe on the rights of other persons; and

          (5) The signature of the SASP director requesting approval for the abandonment or destruction.

          (b) GSA will notify you within 30 calendar days whether you may abandon or destroy the property. GSA will provide alternate disposition instructions if it disapproves your request for abandonment or destruction. If GSA doesn't reply to you within 30 calendar days of notification, the property may be abandoned or destroyed.

        Cooperative Agreements

          § 102-37.325   With whom and for what purpose(s) may a SASP enter into a cooperative agreement?

#### § § 102-37.325

          Section 549(f) of title 40, United States Code allows GSA, or Federal agencies designated by GSA, to enter into cooperative agreements with SASPs to carry out the surplus property donation program. Such agreements allow GSA, or the designated Federal agencies, to use the SASP's property, facilities, personnel, or services or to furnish such resources to the SASP. For example:

          (a) Regional GSA personal property management offices, or designated Federal agencies, may enter into a cooperative agreement to assist a SASP in distributing surplus property for donation. Assistance may include:

          (1) Furnishing the SASP with available GSA or agency office space and related support such as office furniture and information technology equipment needed to screen and process property for donation.

          (2) Permitting the SASP to retain items of surplus property transferred to the SASP that are needed by the SASP in performing its donation functions (see § 102-37.270).

          (b) Regional GSA personal property management offices may help the SASP to enter into agreements with other GSA or Federal activities for the use of Federal telecommunications service or federally-owned real property and related personal property.

          (c) A SASP may enter into a cooperative agreement with GSA to conduct sales of undistributed property on behalf of GSA (see § 102-37.305).

> [67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]

          § 102-37.330   Must the costs of providing support under a cooperative agreement be reimbursed by the parties receiving such support?

#### § § 102-37.330

          The parties to a cooperative agreement must decide among themselves the extent to which the costs of the services they provide must be reimbursed. Their decision should be reflected in the cooperative agreement itself. As a general rule, the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) would require a Federal agency receiving services from a SASP to reimburse the SASP for those services. Since SASPs are not Federal agencies, the Economy Act would not require them to reimburse Federal agencies for services provided by such agencies. In this situation, the Federal agencies would have to determine whether or not their own authorities would permit them to provide services to SASPs without reimbursement. If a Federal agency is reimbursed by a SASP for services provided under a cooperative agreement, it must credit that payment to the fund or appropriation that incurred the related costs.

          § 102-37.335   May a SASP enter into a cooperative agreement with another SASP?

#### § § 102-37.335

          Yes, with GSA's concurrence and where authorized by State law, a SASP may enter into an agreement with an adjacent State to act as its agent and authorized representative in disposing of surplus Federal property. Interstate cooperative agreements may be considered when donees, because of their geographic proximity to the property distribution centers of the adjoining State, could be more efficiently and economically serviced by surplus property facilities in the adjacent State. You and the other SASP must agree to the payment or reimbursement of service charges by the donee and you also must agree to the requirements of § 102-37.205(e).

          § 102-37.340   When may a SASP terminate a cooperative agreement?

#### § § 102-37.340

          You may terminate a cooperative agreement with GSA 60-calendar days after providing GSA with written notice. For other cooperative agreements with other authorized parties, you or the other party may terminate the agreement as mutually agreed. You must promptly notify GSA when such other agreements are terminated.

        Audits and Reviews

          § 102-37.345   When must a SASP be audited?

#### § § 102-37.345

          For each year in which a SASP receives $500,000 or more a year in surplus property or other Federal assistance, it must be audited in accordance with the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) as implemented by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations” (for availability see 5 CFR 1310.3). GSA's donation program should be identified by Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number 39.003 when completing the required schedule of Federal assistance.

          § 102-37.350   Does coverage under the single audit process in OMB Circular A-133 exempt a SASP from other reviews of its program?

#### § § 102-37.350

          No, although SASPs are covered under the single audit process in OMB Circular A-133, from time to time the Government Accountability Office (GAO), GSA, or other authorized Federal activities may audit or review the operations of a SASP. GSA will notify the chief executive officer of the State of the reasons for a GSA audit. When requested, you must make available financial records and all other records of the SASP for inspection by representatives of GSA, GAO, or other authorized Federal activities.

          § 102-37.355   What obligations does a SASP have to ensure that donees meet Circular A-133 requirements?

#### § § 102-37.355

          SASPs, if they donate $500,000 or more in Federal property to a donee in a fiscal year, must ensure that the donee has an audit performed in accordance with Circular A-133. If a donee receives less than $500,000 in donated property, the SASP is not expected to assume responsibility for ensuring the donee meets audit requirements, beyond making sure the donee is aware that the requirements do exist. It is the donee's responsibility to identify and determine the amount of Federal assistance it has received and to arrange for audit coverage.

          (b)  Make other reports GSA may require to carry out its discretionary authority to transfer surplus personal property for donation and to report to the Congress on the status and progress of the donation program.

        Liquidating a SASP

          § 102-37.365   What steps must a SASP take if the State decides to liquidate the agency?

#### § § 102-37.365

          Before suspending operations, a SASP must submit to GSA a liquidation plan that includes:

          (a) Reasons for the liquidation;

          § 102-37.370   Do liquidation plans require public notice?

#### § § 102-37.370

          Yes, a liquidation plan constitutes a major amendment of a SASP's plan of operation and, as such, requires public notice.

        § 102-37.130   What are a SASP's responsibilities in the donation of surplus property?

#### § § 102-37.385

          (a) For most public and nonprofit activities, the SASP determines if an applicant is eligible to receive property as a public agency, a nonprofit educational or public health institution, or for a program for older individuals. A SASP may request GSA assistance or guidance in making such determinations.

          (b) For applicants that offer courses of instruction devoted to the military arts and sciences, the Defense Department will determine eligibility to receive surplus property through the SASP as a service educational activity or SEA.

          § 102-37.390   What basic criteria must an applicant meet before a SASP can qualify it for eligibility?

#### § § 102-37.390

          To qualify for donation program eligibility through a SASP, an applicant must:

          (a) Conform to the definition of one of the categories of eligible entities listed in § 102-37.380 (see appendix C of this part for definitions);

          (b) Demonstrate that it meets any approval, accreditation, or licensing requirements for operation of its program;

          (c) Prove that it is a public agency or a nonprofit and tax-exempt organization under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code;

          (d) Certify that it is not debarred, suspended, or excluded from any Federal program, including procurement programs; and

          (e) Operate in compliance with applicable Federal nondiscrimination statutes.

          § 102-37.395   How can a SASP determine whether an applicant meets any required approval, accreditation, or licensing requirements?

#### § § 102-37.395

          A SASP may accept the following documentation as evidence that an applicant has met established standards for the operation of its educational or health program:

          (a) A certificate or letter from a nationally recognized accrediting agency affirming the applicant meets the agency's standards and requirements.

          (b) The applicant's appearance on a list with other similarly approved or accredited institutions or programs when that list is published by a State, regional, or national accrediting authority.

          (c) Letters from State or local authorities (such as a board of health or a board of education) stating that the applicant meets the standards prescribed for approved or accredited institutions and organizations.

          (d) In the case of educational activities, letters from three accredited or State-approved institutions that students from the applicant institution have been and are being accepted.

          (e) In the case of public health institutions, licensing may be accepted as evidence of approval, provided the licensing authority prescribes the medical requirements and standards for the professional and technical services of the institution.

          (f) The awarding of research grants to the institution by a recognized authority such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Education, or by similar national advisory council or organization.

#### § § 102-37.400

          In general, you must maintain the records required by your State plan to document donee eligibility (see appendix B of this part). For SEAs, you must maintain separate records that include:

          (a) Documentation verifying that the activity has been designated as eligible by DOD to receive surplus DOD property.

          (b) A statement designating one or more donee representative(s) to act for the SEA in acquiring property.

          (c) A listing of the types of property that are needed or have been authorized by DOD for use in the SEA's program.

          § 102-37.405   How often must a SASP update donee eligibility records?

#### § § 102-37.405

          You must update donee eligibility records as needed, but no less than every 3 years, to ensure that all documentation supporting the donee's eligibility is current and accurate. Annually, you must update files for nonprofit organizations whose eligibility depends on annual appropriations, annual licensing, or annual certification. Particular care must be taken to ensure that all records relating to the authority of donee representatives to receive and receipt for property, or to screen property at Federal facilities, are current.

          § 102-37.410   What must a SASP do if a donee fails to maintain its eligibility status?

#### § § 102-37.410

          If you determine that a donee has failed to maintain its eligibility status, you must terminate distribution of property to that donee, recover any usable property still under Federal restriction (as outlined in § 102-37.465), and take any other required compliance actions.

          § 102-37.415   What should a SASP do if an applicant appeals a negative eligibility determination?

#### § § 102-37.415

          If an applicant appeals a negative eligibility determination, forward complete documentation on the appeal request, including your comments and recommendations, to the applicable GSA regional office for review and coordination with GSA headquarters. GSA's decision will be final.

        Conditional Eligibility

          § 102-37.420   May a SASP grant conditional eligibility to applicants who would otherwise qualify as eligible donees, but have been unable to obtain approval, accreditation, or licensing because they are newly organized or their facilities are not yet constructed?

#### § § 102-37.420

          You may grant conditional eligibility to such an applicant provided it submits a statement from any required approving, accrediting, or licensing authority confirming it will be approved, accredited, or licensed. Conditional eligibility may be granted for a limited and reasonable time, not to exceed one year.

> [67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 79 FR 64514, Oct. 30, 2014]

          § 102-37.425   May a SASP grant conditional eligibility to a not-for-profit organization whose tax-exempt status is pending?

#### § § 102-37.425

          No, under no circumstances may you grant conditional eligibility prior to receiving from the applicant a copy of a letter of determination by the Internal Revenue Service stating that the applicant is exempt from Federal taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.

          § 102-37.430   What property can a SASP make available to a donee with conditional eligibility?

#### § § 102-37.430

          You may only make available surplus property that the donee can use immediately. You may not make available property that will only be used at a later date, for example, after the construction of the donee's facility has been completed. If property is provided to the donee with conditional eligibility, and the conditional eligibility lapses (see § 102-37.420), the property must be returned to the SASP for redistribution or disposal.

          § 102-37.445   What certifications must a donee make before receiving property?

#### § § 102-37.445

          Prior to a SASP releasing property to a donee, the donee must certify that:

          § 102-37.450   What agreements must a donee make?

#### § § 102-37.450

          Before a SASP may release property to a donee, the donee must agree to the following conditions:

          (a) The property is acquired on an “as is, where is” basis, without warranty of any kind, and it will hold the Government harmless from any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to the donation of the property, its use, or final disposition.

          (b) It will return to the SASP, at its own expense, any donated property:

          (1) That is not placed in use for the purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation; or

          (2) Which ceases to be used for such purposes within 1 year after being placed in use.

          (c) It will comply with the terms and conditions imposed by the SASP on the use of any item of property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more and any passenger motor vehicle or other donated item. (Not applicable to SEAs.)

          (d) It agrees that, upon execution of the SASP distribution document, it has conditional title only to the property during the applicable period of restriction. Full title to the property will vest in the donee only after the donee has met all of the requirements of this part.

          (e) It will comply with conditions imposed by GSA, if any, requiring special handling or use limitations on donated property.

          (f) It will use the property for an authorized purpose during the period of restriction.

          (g) It will obtain permission from the SASP before selling, trading, leasing, loaning, bailing, cannibalizing, encumbering or otherwise disposing of property during the period of restriction, or removing it permanently for use outside the State.

          (h) It will report to the SASP on the use, condition, and location of donated property, and on other pertinent matters as the SASP may require from time to time.

          (i) If an insured loss of the property occurs during the period of restriction, GSA or the SASP (depending on which agency has imposed the restriction) will be entitled to reimbursement out of the insurance proceeds of an amount equal to the unamortized portion of the fair market value of the damaged or destroyed item.

        Special Handling or Use Conditions

          § 102-37.455   On what categories of surplus property has GSA imposed special handling conditions or use limitations?

#### § § 102-37.455

          GSA has imposed special handling or processing requirements on the property discussed in this section. GSA may, on a case-by-case basis, prescribe additional restrictions for handling or using these items or prescribe special processing requirements on items in addition to those listed in this section.

          (a)  The requirements of this section apply to the donation of any fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft and donable vessels that are 50 feet or more in length, having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more, regardless of the purpose for which donated. Such aircraft or vessels may be donated to public agencies and eligible nonprofit activities provided the aircraft or vessel is not classified for reasons of national security and any lethal characteristics are removed. The following table provides locations of other policies and procedures governing aircraft and vessels:

          (b)  (1) When tax-free or specially denatured alcohol is requested for donation, the donee must have a special permit issued by the Assistant Regional Commissioner of the appropriate regional office, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Department of the Justice, in order to acquire the property. Include the ATF use-permit number on the SF 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property.

          (2) You may not store tax-free or specially denatured alcohol in SASP facilities. You must make arrangements for this property to be shipped or transported directly from the holding agency to the designated donee.

          § 102-37.460   What special terms and conditions apply to the donation of aircraft and vessels?

#### § § 102-37.460

          The following special terms and conditions apply to the donation of aircraft and vessels:

          (a) There must be a period of restriction which will expire after the aircraft or vessel has been used for the purpose stated in the letter of intent (see § 102-37.230) for a period of 5 years, except that the period of restriction for a combat-configured aircraft is in perpetuity.

          (b) The donee of an aircraft must apply to the FAA for registration of an aircraft intended for flight use within 30 calendar days of receipt of the aircraft. The donee of a vessel must, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the vessel, apply for documentation of the vessel under applicable Federal, State, and local laws and must record each document with the U.S. Coast Guard at the port of documentation. The donee's application for registration or documentation must include a fully executed copy of the conditional transfer document and a copy of its letter of intent. The donee must provide the SASP and GSA with a copy of the FAA registration (and a copy of its FAA Standard Airworthiness Certificate if the aircraft is to be flown as a civil aircraft) or Coast Guard documentation.

          (c) The aircraft or vessel must be used solely in accordance with the executed conditional transfer document and the plan of utilization set forth in the donee's letter of intent, unless the donee has amended the letter, and it has been approved in writing by the SASP and GSA and a copy of the amendment recorded with FAA or the U.S. Coast Guard, as applicable.

          (d) In the event any of the terms and conditions imposed by the conditional transfer document are breached, title may revert to the Government. GSA may require the donee to return the aircraft or vessel or pay for any unauthorized disposal, transaction, or use.

          (e) If, during the period of restriction, the aircraft or vessel is no longer needed by the donee, the donee must promptly notify the SASP and request disposal instructions. A SASP may not issue disposal instructions without the prior written concurrence of GSA.

          (f) Military aircraft previously used for ground instruction and/or static display (Category B aircraft, as designated by DOD) or that are combat-configured (Category C aircraft) may not be donated for flight purposes.

          (g) For all aircraft donated for nonflight use, the donee must, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the aircraft, turn over to the SASP the remaining aircraft historical records (except the records of the major components/life limited parts; e.g., engines, transmissions, rotor blades, etc., necessary to substantiate their reuse). The SASP in turn must transmit the records to GSA for forwarding to the FAA.

        Release of Restrictions

          § 102-37.465   May a SASP modify or release any of the terms and conditions of donation?

#### § § 102-37.465

          You may alter or grant releases from State-imposed restrictions, provided your State plan of operation sets forth the standards by which such actions will be taken. You may not grant releases from, or amendments or corrections to:

          (a) The terms and conditions you are required by the Property Act to impose on the use of passenger motor vehicles and any item of property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more.

          (b) Any special handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA, except with the prior written approval of GSA.

          (c) The statutory requirement that usable property be returned by the donee to the SASP if the property has not been placed in use for the purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation or ceases to be used by the donee for those purposes within 1 year of being placed in use, except that:

          (1) You may grant authority to the donee to cannibalize property items subject to this requirement when you determine that such action will result in increased use of the property and that the proposed action meets the standards prescribed in your plan of operation.

          (2) You may, with the written concurrence of GSA, grant donees:

          (i) A time extension to place property into use if the delay in putting the property into use was beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the donee.

          (ii) Authority to trade in one donated item for one like item having similar use potential.

          § 102-37.470   At what point may restrictions be released on property that has been authorized for cannibalization?

#### § § 102-37.470

          Property authorized for cannibalization must remain under the period of restriction imposed by the transfer/distribution document until the proposed cannibalization is completed. Components resulting from the cannibalization, which have a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more, must remain under the restrictions imposed by the transfer/distribution document. Components with a unit acquisition cost of less than $5,000 may be released upon cannibalization from the additional restrictions imposed by the State. However, these components must continue to be used or be otherwise disposed of in accordance with this part.

          § 102-37.475   What are the requirements for releasing restrictions on property being considered for exchange?

#### § § 102-37.475

          GSA must consent to the exchange of donated property under Federal restrictions or special handling conditions. The donee must have used the donated item for its acquired purpose for a minimum of 6 months prior to being considered for exchange, and it must be demonstrated that the exchange will result in increased utilization value to the donee. As a condition of approval of the exchange, the item being exchanged must have remained in compliance with the terms and conditions of the donation. Otherwise, § 102-37.485 applies. The item acquired by the donee must be:

          (a) Made subject to the period of restriction remaining on the item exchanged; and

          (b) Of equal or greater value than the item exchanged.

        Compliance and Utilization

          § 102-37.480   What must a SASP do to ensure that property is used for the purpose(s) for which it was donated?

#### § § 102-37.480

          You must conduct utilization reviews, as provided in your plan of operation, to ensure that donees are using surplus property during the period of restriction for the purposes for which it was donated. You must fully document your efforts and report all instances of noncompliance (misuse or mishandling of property) to GSA.

          § 102-37.485   What actions must a SASP take if a review or other information indicates noncompliance with donation terms and conditions?

#### § § 102-37.485

          If a review or other information indicates noncompliance with donation terms and conditions, you must:

          (a) Promptly investigate any suspected failure to comply with the conditions of donated property;

          (b) Notify GSA immediately where there is evidence or allegation of fraud, wrongdoing by a screener, or nonuse, misuse, or unauthorized disposal or destruction of donated property;

          (c) Temporarily defer any further donations of property to any donee to be investigated for noncompliance allegations until such time as the investigation has been completed and:

          (1) A determination made that the allegations are unfounded and the deferment is removed.

          (2) The allegations are substantiated and the donee is proposed for suspension or debarment; and

          (d) Take steps to correct the noncompliance or otherwise enforce the conditions imposed on use of the property if a donee is found to be in noncompliance. Enforcement of compliance may involve:

          (1) Ensuring the property is used by the present donee for the purpose for which it was donated.

          (2) Recovering the property from the donee for:

          (i) Redistribution to another donee within the State;

          (ii) Transfer through GSA to another SASP; or

          (iii) Transfer through GSA to a Federal agency.

          (3) Recovering fair market value or the proceeds of disposal in cases of unauthorized disposal or destruction.

          (4) Recovering fair rental value for property in cases where the property has been loaned or leased to an ineligible user or used for an unauthorized purpose.

          (5) Disposing of by public sale property no longer suitable, usable, or necessary for donation.

          § 102-37.490   When must a SASP coordinate with GSA on compliance actions?

#### § § 102-37.490

#### § § 102-38.75

          (a) You will sell personal property upon such terms and conditions as the head of your agency or designee deems proper to promote the fairness, openness, and timeliness necessary for the sale to be conducted in a manner most advantageous to the Government.

You must also document the required terms and conditions of each sale, including, but not limited to, the following terms and conditions, as applicable:

          (1) Inspection.

          (2) Condition and location of property.

          (3) Eligibility of bidders.

          (11) Modifications, withdrawals, or late bids.

          (12) Requirements to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 41 CFR part 101-42 contains useful guidance addressing many of these requirements. You should also contact your agency's Office of General Counsel or environmental office to identify applicable Federal, State, or local environmental laws and regulations.

          (13) Certificate of independent price determinations.

          (14) Covenant against contingent fees.

          (15) Limitation on Government's liability.

          § 102-38.80   Which method of sale should we use?

#### § § 102-38.80

          (a) You may use any method of sale provided the sale is publicly advertised and the personal property is sold with full and open competition. Exceptions to the requirement for competitive bids for negotiated sales (including fixed price sales) are contained in §§ 102-38.100 through 102-38.125. You must select the method of sale that will bring maximum return at minimum cost, considering factors such as—

          (1) Type and quantity of property;

          (2) Location of property;

          (3) Potential market;

          (4) Cost to prepare and conduct the sale;

          (5) Available facilities; and

          (6) Sales experience of the selling activity.

          (b) Methods of sale may include sealed bid sales, spot bid sales, auctions, or negotiated sales and may be conducted at a physical location or through any electronic media that is publicly accessible.

        Competitive Sales

          § 102-38.85   What is a sealed bid sale?

#### § § 102-38.85

          A sealed bid sale is a sale in which bid prices are kept confidential until bid opening. Bids are submitted either electronically or in writing according to formats specified by the selling agency, and all bids are held for public disclosure at a designated time and place.

          § 102-38.90   What is a spot bid sale?

#### § § 102-38.90

          A spot bid sale is a sale where immediately following the offering of the item or lot of property, bids are examined, and awards are made or bids rejected on the spot. Bids are either submitted electronically or in writing according to formats specified by the selling agency, and must not be disclosed prior to announcement of award.

          § 102-38.95   What is an auction?

#### § § 102-38.95

          An auction is a sale where the bid amounts of different bidders are disclosed as they are submitted, providing bidders the option to increase their bids if they choose. Bids are submitted electronically and/or by those physically present at the sale. Normally, the bidder with the highest bid at the close of each bidding process is awarded the property.

        Negotiated Sales

          § 102-38.100   What is a negotiated sale?

#### § § 102-38.100

          A negotiated sale is a sale where the selling price is arrived at between the seller and the buyer, subject to obtaining such competition as is feasible under the circumstances.

          § 102-38.105   Under what conditions may we negotiate sales of personal property?

#### § § 102-38.105

          You may negotiate sales of personal property when—

          (a) The personal property has an estimated fair market value that does not exceed $15,000;

          (b) The disposal will be to a State, territory, possession, political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation;

          (c) Bid prices after advertising are not reasonable and re-advertising would serve no useful purpose;

          (d) Public exigency does not permit any delay such as that caused by the time required to advertise a sale;

          (e) The sale promotes public health, safety, or national security;

          (f) The sale is in the public interest under a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress. This authority may be used only with specific lot(s) of property or for categories determined by the Administrator of General Services for a designated period but not in excess of three months;

          (g) Selling the property competitively would have an adverse impact on the national economy, provided that the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation, e.g., sale of large quantities of an agricultural product that impact domestic markets; or

          (h) Otherwise authorized by Title 40 of the U.S. Code or other law.

          § 102-38.110   Who approves our determinations to conduct negotiated sales?

#### § § 102-38.110

          The head of your agency (or designee) must approve all negotiated sales of personal property.

          § 102-38.115   What are the specific reporting requirements for negotiated sales?

#### § § 102-38.115

          For negotiated sales of personal property, you must—

          (a) In accordance with 40 U.S.C. 545(e), and in advance of the sale, submit to the oversight committees for the General Services Administration (GSA) in the Senate and House, explanatory statements for each sale by negotiation of any personal property with an estimated fair market value in excess of $15,000. You must maintain copies of the explanatory statements in your disposal files. No statement is needed for negotiated sales at fixed price or for any sale made without advertising when authorized by law other than 40 U.S.C. 545; and

          (b) Report annually to GSA, Personal Property Management Policy Division (MTP), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC, 20405, within 60 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, a listing and description of all negotiated sales of personal property with an estimated fair market value in excess of $5,000. You may submit the report electronically or manually (see § 102-38.330).

          § 102-38.120   When may we conduct negotiated sales of personal property at fixed prices (fixed price sale)?

#### § § 102-38.120

          You may conduct negotiated sales of personal property at fixed prices (fixed price sale) under this section when:

          (a) The items are authorized to be sold at fixed price by the Administrator of General Services, as reflected in GSA Bulletin FMR B-10 (located at ). You may also contact the GSA Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management (MT) at the address listed in § 102-38.115 to determine which items are on this list of authorized items;

          (b) The head of your agency, or designee, determines in writing that such sales serve the best interest of the Government. When you are selling property on behalf of a holding agency, you must consult with the holding agency in determining whether a fixed price sale meets this criterion; and

          (c) You must publicize such sales to the extent consistent with the value and nature of the property involved, and the prices established must reflect the estimated fair market value of the property. Property is sold on a first-come, first-served basis. You or the holding agency may also establish additional terms and conditions that must be met by the successful purchaser in accordance with § 102-38.75.

> [73 FR 20803, Apr. 17, 2008]

          § 102-38.125   May we sell personal property at fixed prices to State agencies?

#### § § 102-38.125

          Yes, before offering to the public, you may offer the property at fixed prices (through the State Agencies for Surplus Property) to any States, territories, possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax-supported agencies therein, which have expressed an interest in obtaining the property. For additional information, see subpart G of this part.

        Advertising

          § 102-38.130   Must we publicly advertise sales of Federal personal property?

#### § § 102-38.130

          Yes, you must provide public notice of your sale of personal property to permit full and open competition.

          § 102-38.135   What constitutes a public advertisement?

#### § § 102-38.135

          Announcement of the sale using any media that reaches the public and is appropriate to the type and value of personal property to be sold is considered public advertising. You may also distribute mailings or flyers of your offer to sell to prospective purchasers on mailing lists. Public notice should be made far enough in advance of the sale to ensure adequate notice, and to target your advertising efforts toward the market that will provide the best return at the lowest cost.

          § 102-38.140   What must we include in the public notice on sale of personal property?

#### § § 102-38.140

          In the public notice, you must provide information necessary for potential buyers to participate in the sale, such as—

          (a) Date, time and location of sale;

          (b) General categories of property being offered for sale;

          (c) Inspection period;

          (d) Method of sale (i.e., spot bid, sealed bid, auction);

          (e) Selling agency; and

          (f) Who to contact for additional information.

        Pre-Sale Activities

          § 102-38.145   Must we allow for inspection of the personal property to be sold?

#### § § 102-38.145

          Yes, you must allow for an electronic or physical inspection of the personal property to be sold. You must allow prospective bidders sufficient time for inspection. If inspection is restricted to electronic inspections only, due to unusual circumstances prohibiting physical inspection, you must notify your General Services Administration Regional Personal Property Office in writing, with the circumstances surrounding this restriction at least 3 days prior to the start of the screening period.

          § 102-38.150   How long is the inspection period?

#### § § 102-38.150

          The length of the inspection period allowed depends upon whether the inspection is done electronically or physically. You should also consider such factors as the circumstances of sale, volume of property, type of property, location of the property, and accessibility of the sales facility. Normally, you should provide at least 7 calendar days to ensure potential buyers have the opportunity to perform needed inspections.

        Offer to Sell

          § 102-38.155   What is an offer to sell?

#### § § 102-38.155

          An offer to sell is a notice listing the terms and conditions for bidding on an upcoming sale of personal property, where prospective purchasers are advised of the requirements for a responsive bid and the contractual obligations once a bid is accepted.

          § 102-38.160   What must be included in the offer to sell?

#### § § 102-38.160

          § 102-38.165   Are the terms and conditions in the offer to sell binding?

#### § § 102-38.165

          Yes, the terms and conditions in the offer to sell are normally incorporated into the sales contract, and therefore binding upon both the buyer and the seller once a bid is accepted.

        Buyer Eligibility

          § 102-38.170   May we sell Federal personal property to anyone?

However, unless allowed by Federal or agency regulations, employees having nonpublic information regarding property offered for sale may not participate in that sale (see 5 CFR 2635.703). For purposes of this section, the term “Federal employee” also applies to an immediate member of the employee's household.

          § 102-38.195   Must bidders use authorized bid forms?

#### § § 102-38.195

          No, bidders do not have to use authorized bid forms; however if a bidder uses does not use an authorized bid form to submit a bid, the bid may be considered only if—

          (a) The bidder accepts all the terms and conditions of the offer to sell; and

          (b) Award of the bid would result in a binding contract.

> [68 FR 51421, Aug. 26, 2003, as amended at 89 FR 67866, Aug. 22, 2024]

          § 102-38.200   Who may accept bids?

          Authorized agency representatives may accept bids for your agency. These individuals should meet your agency's requirements for approval of Government contracts.

          § 102-38.205   Must we accept all bids?

#### § § 102-38.205

          No, the Government reserves the right to accept or reject any or all bids. You may reject any or all bids when such action is advantageous to the Government, or when it is in the public interest to do so.

          § 102-38.210   What happens when bids have been rejected?

#### § § 102-38.210

          You may re-offer items for which all bids have been rejected at the same sale, if possible, or another sale.

#### § § 102-38.215

          You may disclose bid results to the public after the sales award of any item or lot of property.

No information other than names may be disclosed regarding the bidder(s).

          § 102-38.220   What must we do when the highest bids received have the same bid amount?

#### § § 102-38.220

          When the highest bids received have the same bid amount, you must consider other factors of the sale (e.g., timely removal of the property, terms of payment, etc.) that would make one offer more advantageous to the Government. However, if you are unable to make a determination based on available information, and the Government has an acceptable offer, you may re-offer the property for sale, or you may utilize random tiebreakers to avoid the expense of reselling the property.

          § 102-38.225   What are the additional requirements in the bid process?

#### § § 102-38.225

          All sales except fixed price sales must contain a certification of independent price determination. If there is suspicion of false certification or an indication of collusion, you must refer the matter to the Department of Justice or your agency's Office of the Inspector General.

          § 102-38.230   Is a bid deposit required to buy personal property?

#### § § 102-38.230

          No, a bid deposit is not required to buy personal property. However, should you require a bid deposit to protect the Government's interest, a deposit of 20 percent of the total amount of the bid is generally considered reasonable.

#### § § 102-38.235

          In addition to the acceptable types of payments in § 102-38.290, you may also accept a deposit bond. A deposit bond may be used in lieu of cash or other acceptable form of deposit when permitted by the offer to sell, such as the Standard Form (SF) 150, Deposit Bond—Individual Invitation, Sale of Government Personal Property, SF 151, Deposit Bond—Annual, Sale of Government Personal Property, and SF 28, Affidavit of Individual Surety. For information on how to obtain these forms, see § 102-2.135 of subchapter A.

          § 102-38.240   What happens to the deposit bond if the bidder defaults or wants to withdraw their bid?

#### § § 102-38.240

          (a) When a bid deposit is secured by a deposit bond and the bidder defaults, you must issue a notice of default to the bidder and the surety company.

          (b) When a bid deposit is secured by a deposit bond and the bidder wants to withdraw their bid, you should return the deposit bond to the bidder.

#### § § 102-38.245

          Consider late bids for award only when the bids were delivered timely to the address specified and your agency caused the delay in delivering the bids to the official designated to accept the bids.

#### § § 102-38.255

          (a) Yes, a bidder may modify or withdraw a bid prior to the start of the sale or the time set for the opening of the bids. After the start of the sale, or the time set for opening the bids, the bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid.

#### § § 102-38.285

          (a) Generally, no specific form or format is designated for transferring title from the Government to the buyer for personal property sold.

          (a) You may retain that portion of the sales proceeds, in accordance with your agreement with the holding agency, equal to your direct costs and reasonably related indirect costs (including your share of the Governmentwide costs to support the eFAS Internet portal and Governmentwide reporting requirements) incurred in selling personal property.

          (b) A holding agency may retain that portion of the sales proceeds equal to its costs of care and handling directly related to the sale of personal property by the SC (e.g., shipment to the SC, storage pending sale, and inspection by prospective buyers).

          (c) After accounting for amounts retained under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, a holding agency may retain the balance of proceeds from the sale of its agency's personal property when—

          (1) It has the statutory authority to retain all proceeds from sales of personal property;

          (2) The property sold was acquired with non-appropriated funds as defined in § 102-36.40 of this subchapter B;

          (3) The property sold was surplus Government property that was in the custody of a contractor or subcontractor, and the contract or subcontract provisions authorize the proceeds of sale to be credited to the price or cost of the contract or subcontract;

          (4) The property was sold to obtain replacement property under the exchange/sale authority pursuant to part 102-39 of this subchapter B; or

          (5) The property sold was related to waste prevention and recycling programs, under the authority of Section 607 of Public Law 107-67 (Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. 107-67, 115 Stat. 514). Consult your General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer for guidance on use of this authority.

        Disputes

          § 102-38.305   How do we handle disputes involved in the sale of Federal personal property?

#### § § 102-38.305

          First contact your Office of General Counsel. Further guidance can be found in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 33.

          § 102-38.310   Are we required to use the Disputes clause in the sale of personal property?

#### § § 102-38.310

          Yes, you must ensure the Disputes clause contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.233-1 (48 CFR part 52) is included in all offers to sell and contracts for the sale of personal property.

          § 102-38.315   Are we required to use Alternative Disputes Resolution for sales contracts?

#### § § 102-38.315

          No, you are not required to use Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) for sales contracts. However, you are encouraged to use ADR procedures in accordance with the authority and the requirements of the Alternative Disputes Resolution Act of 1998 (28 U.S.C. 651-658).

      Subpart E—Other Governing Statutes

        Antitrust Requirements

          § 102-38.325   What are the requirements pertaining to antitrust laws?

#### § § 102-38.325

          When the sale of personal property has an estimated fair market value of $3 million or more or if the sale involves a patent, process, technique, or invention, you must notify the Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and get DOJ's opinion as to whether the sale would give the buyer an unfair advantage in the marketplace and violate any antitrust laws. Include in the notification the description and location of the property, method of sale and proposed selling price, and information on the proposed purchaser and intended use of the property. You must not complete the sale until you have received confirmation from the Attorney General that the proposed transaction would not violate any antitrust laws.

        § 102-38.320   Are there other statutory requirements governing the sale of Federal personal property?

#### § § 102-38.320

        Yes, in addition to Title 40 of the U.S. Code the sale of Federal personal property is governed by other statutory requirements, such as the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134, sec. 31001, 110 Stat. 1321-358) and antitrust requirements that are discussed in § 102-38.325.

      Subpart F—Reporting Requirements

        § 102-38.330   Are there any reports that we must submit to the General Services Administration?

#### § § 102-38.330

        Yes, there are two sales reports you must submit to the General Services Administration (GSA), Personal Property Management Policy Division (MTP), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405—

        (a)  Within 60 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, you must provide GSA with a listing and description of all negotiated sales with an estimated fair market value in excess of $5,000 (see § 102-38.115). For each negotiated sale that meets this criterion, provide the following:

        (1) Description of the property (including quantity and condition).

        (2) Acquisition cost and date (if not known, estimate and so indicate).

        (3) Estimated fair market value (including date of estimate and name of estimator).

        (4) Name and address of purchaser.

        (5) Date of sale.

        (6) Gross and net sales proceeds.

        (7) Justification for conducting a negotiated sale.

        (b)  Within 90 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, you must provide a summary report to GSA of transactions conducted under the exchange/sale authority under part 102-39 of this subchapter B (see § 102-39.75).

        § 102-38.335   Is there any additional personal property sales information that we must submit to the General Services Administration?

#### § § 102-38.335

        Yes, you must report to the General Services Administration's (GSA's) Asset Disposition Management System (ADMS), once that capability is established, any sales information that GSA deems necessary.

      Subpart G—Provisions for State and Local Governments

        § 102-38.340   How may we sell personal property to State and local governments?

#### § § 102-38.340

        You may sell Government personal property to State and local governments through—

        (a) Competitive sale to the public;

        (b) Negotiated sale, through the appropriate State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP); or

        (c) Negotiated sale at fixed price (fixed price sale), through the appropriate SASP. (This method of sale can be used prior to a competitive sale to the public, if desired.)

        § 102-38.345   Do we have to withdraw personal property advertised for public sale if a State Agency for Surplus Property wants to buy it?

#### § § 102-38.345

        No, you are not required to withdraw the item from public sale if the property has been advertised.

        § 102-38.350   Are there special provisions for State and local governments regarding negotiated sales?

#### § § 102-38.350

        Yes, you must waive the requirement for bid deposits and payment prior to removal of the property. However, payment must be made within 30 calendar days after purchase. If payment is not made within 30 days, you may charge simple interest at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611), from the date of written demand for payment.

        § 102-38.355   Do the regulations of this part apply to State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) when conducting sales?

#### § § 102-38.355

        Yes, State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) must follow the regulations in this part when conducting sales on behalf of the General Services Administration of Government personal property in their custody.

      Subpart H—Implementation of the Federal Asset Sales Program

**Source:** Source: 73 FR 20803, Apr. 17, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

        § 102-38.360   What must an executive agency do to implement the eFAS program?

#### § § 102-38.360

        (a) An executive agency must review the effectiveness of all sales solutions, and compare them to the effectiveness (e.g., cost, level of service, and value added services) of the eFAS SCs. Agencies should give full consideration to sales solutions utilizing private sector entities, including small businesses, that are more effective than the solutions provided by any eFAS-approved SC. If the agency decides that there are more effective sales solutions than those solutions offered by the eFAS SCs, the agency must request a waiver from the milestones using the procedures and forms provided by the eFAS Planning Office. Waivers will be approved by the eFAS Planning Office upon presentation of a business case showing that complying with an eFAS milestone is either impracticable or inefficient. Waiver approval will be coordinated with GSA's Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management. Contact the eFAS Planning Office at  to obtain these procedures and forms.

        (b) An approved waiver for meeting one of the eFAS milestones does not automatically waive all milestone requirements. For example, if an agency receives a waiver to the migration milestone, the agency must still (1) post asset information on the eFAS Web site and (2) provide post-sales data to the eFAS Planning Office in accordance with the content and format requirements developed by the eFAS ESC, unless waivers to these milestones are also requested and approved. Waivers to the eFAS milestones will not be permanent. Upon expiration of the waiver to the migration milestone, an agency must either migrate to an approved SC, or serve as a fully functioning SC, as soon as practicable. See the definition of a “Sales Center” at § 102-38.35 for an overview of how agency sales solutions become SCs.

        (c) An agency which receives a waiver from the eFAS milestones must comply with subparts A through G of this part as if it were an SC.

        (d) An executive agency must comply with all eFAS milestones approved by OMB including those regarding the completion of an agency-wide sales migration plan, the reporting of pre- and post-sales data, and the migration to approved SCs unless a waiver has been submitted by the agency and approved by the eFAS Planning Office. The eFAS milestones are available for viewing at

        § 102-38.365   Is a holding agency required to report property in “scrap” condition to its selected SC?

#### § § 102-38.365

        No. Property which has no value except for its basic material content (scrap material) may be disposed of by the holding agency by sale or as otherwise provided in § 102-38.70. However, the holding agency should consult the SC(s) selected by the holding agency as to the feasibility of selling the scrap material. Agencies selling scrap property under authority of this subpart are still required to report sales metrics in accordance with eFAS ESC-approved format and content.

        § 102-38.370   What does a holding agency do with property which cannot be sold by its SC?

#### § § 102-38.370

        All reasonable efforts must be afforded the SC to sell the property. If the property remains unsold after the time frame agreed to between the SC and the holding agency, the holding agency may dispose of the property by sale or as otherwise provided in § 102-38.70. The lack of public interest in buying the property is evidence that the sales proceeds would be minimal. Agencies selling property under authority of this subpart are still required to report sales metrics in accordance with eFAS ESC-approved format and content.

    PART 102-39—REPLACEMENT OF PERSONAL PROPERTY PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE/SALE AUTHORITY

**Source:** Source: 66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General

        § 102-39.5   What is the exchange/sale authority?

#### § § 102-39.5

        The exchange/sale authority is a statutory provision, (40 U.S.C. 503), which states in part: “In acquiring personal property, an executive agency may exchange or sell similar items and may apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the property acquired.”

> [73 FR 50880, Aug. 29, 2008]

        § 102-39.10   What does this part cover?

#### § § 102-39.10

        This part covers the exchange/sale authority, and applies to all personal property owned by executive agencies worldwide. For the exchange/sale of aircraft parts and hazardous materials, you must meet the requirements in this part and in parts 101-33 and 101-42 of this title.

        § 102-39.15   How are the terms “I” and “you” used in this part?

#### § § 102-39.15

        Use of pronouns “I” and “you” throughout this part refer to executive agencies.

        § 102-39.20   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 102-39.20

        The following definitions apply to this part:

        means to procure or otherwise obtain personal property, including by lease (sometimes known as rent).

        means arms, ammunition, and implements of war listed in the U.S. munitions list (22 CFR part 121).

        means any personal property under the control of any Federal agency that is no longer required for that agency's needs or responsibilities, as determined by the agency head or designee.

        means to replace personal property by trade or trade-in with the supplier of the replacement property.

        means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property.

        means any executive department or independent establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including any wholly owned Government corporation.

        means any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under the Architect's direction).

        means property having added value for display purposes because its historical significance is greater than its fair market value for continued use. Items that are commonly available and remain in use for their intended purpose, such as military aircraft still in use by active or reserve units, are not historic items.

        means the process of acquiring personal property to be used in place of personal property that is still needed but:

        (1) No longer adequately performs the tasks for which it is used; or

        (2) Does not meet the agency's need as well as the personal property to be acquired.

        means the modification of a personal property item undertaken to extend the life of the item beyond that which was previously planned. SLEPs extend capital asset life by retrofit, major modification, remanufacturing, betterment, or enhancement.

        means the acquired item(s) and replaced item(s):

        (1) Are identical; or

        (2) Fall within a single Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group of property (includes any and all forms of property within a single FSC Group); or

        (3) Are parts or containers for similar end items; or

        (4) Are designed or constructed for the same general purpose (includes any and all forms of property regardless of the FSC Group to which they are assigned).

        means excess personal property not required for the needs of any Federal agency, as determined by GSA under part 102-37 of this chapter.

        § 102-39.25   Which exchange/sale provisions are subject to deviation?

#### § § 102-39.25

        All of the provisions in this part are subject to deviation (upon presentation of adequate justification) except for those mandated by statute, as described in note 1 to §§ 102-39.60(a) and 102-39.80.

      Subpart B—Exchange/Sale Considerations

        § 102-39.35   When should I consider using the exchange/sale authority?

#### § § 102-39.35

        You should consider using the exchange/sale authority when replacing personal property.

> [73 FR 50880, Aug. 29, 2008]

        § 102-39.40   How does the exchange/sale authority differ from the disposal process for excess/surplus personal property?

#### § § 102-39.40

        (a) The primary difference is that sales proceeds or exchange allowances may be used to acquire similar replacement personal property that is still needed under the exchange/sale authority as described in this part; whereas under the more frequently used excess/surplus disposal process, you would not be able to use sales proceeds or exchange allowances to acquire replacement personal property.

        (b) Your use of the exchange/sale authority is optional and should be considered when needed replacement assets may be acquired under the provisions of this part. If exchange/sale is not practicable (for example, if conducting an exchange/sale transaction is not cost effective), you should dispose of the property through the excess/surplus disposal process by reporting the property as excess, as addressed in part 102-36 of this chapter.

        (c) In the excess/surplus disposal process, any net proceeds from the sale of surplus property generally must be forwarded to the miscellaneous receipts account at the United States Treasury, and thus would not be available to you for use in acquiring similar replacement property or for any other purpose. You may use the exchange/sale authority in the acquisition of personal property even if the acquisition is under a services contract, as long as the property acquired under the services contract is similar to the property exchanged or sold (e.g., for a service life extension program (SLEP), exchange allowances or sales proceeds would be available for replacement of similar items, but not for services).

> [88 FR 25511, Apr. 27, 2023]

        § 102-39.45   When should I not use the exchange/sale authority?

#### § § 102-39.45

        You should not use the exchange/sale authority if the exchange allowance or estimated sales proceeds for the property will be unreasonably low. You must either abandon or destroy such property, or declare the property excess, in accordance with part 102-36 of this chapter. Further, you must not use the exchange/sale authority if the transaction(s) would violate any other applicable statute or regulation.

> [66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 11539, Mar. 11, 2004. Redesignated at 73 FR 50880, Aug. 29, 2008]

        § 102-39.50   How do I determine whether to do an exchange or a sale?

#### § § 102-39.50

        You must determine whether an exchange or sale will provide the greater return for the Government. When estimating the return under each method, consider all related administrative and overhead costs.

> [66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001. Redesignated at 73 FR 50880, Aug. 29, 2008]

        § 102-39.55   When should I offer property I am exchanging or selling under the exchange/sale authority to other Federal agencies or State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASP)?

#### § § 102-39.55

        If you have property to replace which is eligible for exchange/sale, you should first, to the maximum extent practicable, solicit:

        (a) Federal agencies known to use or distribute such property. If a Federal agency is interested in acquiring and paying for the property, you should arrange for a reimbursable transfer. Reimbursable transfers may also be conducted with the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under the Architect's direction, the District of Columbia, and mixed-ownership Government corporations. When conducting a reimbursable transfer, you must:

        (1) Do so under terms mutually agreeable to you and the recipient.

        (2) Not require reimbursement of an amount greater than the estimated fair market value of the transferred property.

        (3) Apply the transfer proceeds in whole or part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property; and

        (b) State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) known to have an interest in acquiring such property. If a SASP is interested in acquiring the property, you should consider selling it to the SASP by negotiated sale at fixed price under the conditions specified at § 102-38.125 of this title. The sales proceeds must be applied in whole or part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property.

        § 102-39.60   What restrictions and prohibitions apply to the exchange/sale of personal property?

#### § § 102-39.60

        Unless a deviation is requested of and approved by GSA as addressed in part 102-2 of this chapter and the provisions of §§ 102-39.25 and 102-39.30, you must not use the exchange/sale authority for:

        (a) The following FSC Groups of personal property:

        (1) 10 Weapons.

        (2) 11 Nuclear ordinance.

        (3) 44 Furnace, Steam Plant, and Drying Equipment; and Nuclear Reactors (FSC Class 4470, Nuclear Reactors only).

        (4) 68 Chemical and chemical products.

        (5) 84 Clothing, individual equipment, and insignia.

        (b) Materials in the National Defense Stockpile (50 U.S.C. 98-98h) or the Defense Production Act inventory (50 U.S.C. App. 2093).

        (c) Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials unless you meet the requirements of § 101-42.1102-4 of this title.

        (d) Controlled substances, unless you meet the requirements of § 101-42.1102-3 of this title.

        (e) Property with a condition code of scrap, as defined at FMR 102-36.40, except:

        (1) Property that had utility and value at the point in time when a determination was made to use the exchange/sale authority;

        (2) Property that was otherwise eligible for exchange/sale, but was coded as scrap due to damage (e.g., accident or natural disaster); or

        (3) Scrap gold for fine gold.

        (f) Property that was originally acquired as excess or forfeited property or from another source other than new procurement, unless such property has been in official use by the acquiring agency for at least 1 year. You may exchange or sell forfeited property in official use for less than 1 year if the head of your agency determines that a continuing valid requirement exists, but the specific item in use no longer meets that requirement, and that exchange or sale meets all other requirements of this part.

        (g) Property that is dangerous to public health or safety without first rendering such property innocuous or providing for adequate safeguards as part of the exchange/sale.

        (h) Combat material without demilitarizing it or obtaining a demilitarization waiver or other necessary clearances from the Department of Defense Demilitarization Office.

        (i) Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP) and Critical Safety Items (CSI) unless you meet the provisions of § 102-33.370 of this title.

        (j) Acquisition of unauthorized replacement property.

        (k) Acquisition of replacement property that violates any:

        (1) Restriction on procurement of a commodity or commodities;

        (2) Replacement policy or standard prescribed by the President, the Congress, or the Administrator of General Services; or

        (3) Contractual obligation.

        (l) Vessels subject to 40 U.S.C. 548.

        (m) Aircraft and aircraft parts, unless there is full compliance with all exchange/sale provisions in part 102-33 of this chapter (41 CFR part 102-33).

        You may use the exchange/sale authority only if you meet all of the following conditions:

        (a) The property exchanged or sold is similar to the property acquired;

        (b) The property exchanged or sold is not excess or surplus and you have a continuing need for similar property;

        (c) The property exchanged or sold was not acquired for the principal purpose of exchange or sale;

        (d) When replacing personal property, the exchange allowance or sales proceeds from the disposition of that property may only be used to offset the cost of the replacement property, not services;

        (e) Your agency documents at the time of exchange or sale (or at the time of acquiring the replacement property if acquisition precedes the exchange or sale) that the exchange allowance or sale proceeds will be applied to the acquisition of replacement property; and

        (f) Except for transactions involving books and periodicals in your libraries, you document the basic facts associated with each exchange/sale transaction. At a minimum, the documentation must include:

        (1) The FSC Group of the items exchanged or sold, and the items acquired;

        (2) The number of items exchanged or sold, and the number of items acquired;

        (3) The acquisition cost and exchange allowance or net sales proceeds of the items exchanged or sold, and the acquisition cost of the items acquired;

        (4) The date of the transaction(s);

#### § § 102-40.35

        Personal property requiring special handling includes property containing hazardous materials or property which exhibits dangerous characteristics such that improper use, storage, transportation or disposal may lead to potential safety, health, environmental, economic, or national security risks. In many situations, the use, storage, transportation or disposal of these items is governed by Federal, state, and local laws. Personal property requiring special handling may also include animals and plants which may perish if not handled appropriately, as well as perishable products that may lose their utility if not handled appropriately.

        § 102-40.40   What are our responsibilities concerning personal property requiring special handling?

#### § § 102-40.40

        You are responsible for—

        (a) Identifying and accounting for property with special handling requirements;

        (b) Complying with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the handling, storage, labeling, use, and final disposition of such property;

        (c) Ensuring adequate storage and safeguarding of such property,  secured or limited access storage areas, warning signs, and protective clothing and equipment; and

        (d) Transporting materials requiring special handling in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT), EPA, state and local regulations.

        § 102-40.45   What must we do when we have identified personal property with special handling requirements?

#### § § 102-40.45

        You must properly mark, tag, or label personal property with special handling requirements in accordance with applicable Federal law, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements (29 CFR 1910.1200), regarding the actual or potential hazard associated with the property, and ensure that such information is maintained and perpetuated in the official agency property records. Labeling requirements for substances that are excluded from the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200 are found in the references listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) and (6).

        § 102-40.50   What must we do when we no longer need personal property with special handling requirements?

#### § § 102-40.50

        Except for the items listed in § 102-40.55, you must report excess personal property with special handling requirements that you no longer need to GSA for Federal and donation screening (see § 102-36.215 of this subchapter for how to report excess personal property to GSA). The report to GSA must clearly identify property requiring special handling, and all related hazards, precautions, and handling requirements related to this property. You must dispose of property not required to be reported to GSA in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and your agency procedures. See § 102-40.125 for policy regarding disposal of property requiring special handling by abandonment or destruction. Disposal must be accomplished so as to preserve as much as possible, any civilian utility or commercial value of the property.

        § 102-40.55   Do we report all excess personal property with special handling requirements to GSA?

#### § § 102-40.55

        No. Because of their characteristics, certain items are not subject to the usual disposal procedures. You are not required to report to GSA excess personal property with special handling requirements in any of the following categories listed below.

        (a)  You must dispose of extremely hazardous personal property not reported to GSA in accordance with applicable demilitarization requirements, EPA regulations, state and local laws or regulations, and other Federal laws, regulations or guidelines. However, if time and circumstances permit, this material may be reported to GSA to optimize use of this already-acquired material. When an item that is determined to be extremely hazardous property becomes excess, the holding agency should notify the appropriate GSA regional personal property office, which will determine if the property should be reported using Report of Excess Personal Property, Standard Form (SF) 120 or another method. At a minimum, you must identify the item, and describe the actual or potential hazard(s) associated with the handling, storage, or use of the item(s). This GSA regional office will determine the utilization, donation, sales or other disposal requirements, and provide appropriate guidance to the holding agency.

        (b)  You must dispose of hazardous wastes not reported to GSA in accordance with applicable demilitarization requirements, EPA regulations, state and local laws or regulations, and other Federal laws, regulations or guidelines.

        (c)  You may dispose of perishables with no further utility by abandonment or destruction when it is not detrimental to public health or safety (see the abandonment/destruction provisions in § 102-40.125 and in part 102-36 of this subchapter). Although there is no requirement to report perishables to GSA if their spoilage is imminent (see § 102-36.220), perishables that have a longer time before spoilage and are clearly able to be used may be reported to GSA in accordance with part 102-36. When reporting perishables to GSA, you should annotate the Report for Excess Personal Property, SF 120 or electronic reporting form to show whether there is a specific expiration date for the perishable item and whether such date is an original or extended date.

        (d)  The EPA, under its independent authority, may transfer accountability for hazardous materials deemed by EPA to be research materials to Federal, state, and local agencies, research institutions, or commercial businesses to conduct research or to clean-up a contaminated site.

        § 102-40.60   May we reassign hazardous materials?

#### § § 102-40.60

        Yes, when hazardous materials are reassigned within an executive agency, information on the actual or potential hazard must be included in the documentation effecting the reassignment, and the recipient organization must perpetuate in the inventory or control records visibility of the nature of the actual or potential hazard.

        § 102-40.65   Who is responsible for the custody of hazardous materials and property requiring special handling?

#### § § 102-40.65

        The holding agency is responsible for the custody of hazardous materials and property requiring special handling. Custody of these items may be transferred in whole or in part to another Federal agency with that receiving agency's consent.

        (f) Friable asbestos materials that contain more than one percent asbestos by weight and can, by hand pressure, be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder, thus allowing for potential release of asbestos fibers into the air. Property containing friable asbestos normally is not to be transferred, donated or sold. Notwithstanding these provisions, holding agencies, on a case-by-case basis, may request approval from GSA Central Office, with consultation from the EPA, to transfer, donate or sell such property if in the judgment of the holding agency, special circumstances warrant such action.

        (g) Excess personal property known to contain friable asbestos shall neither be reported to GSA nor transferred among Federal agencies excepted as noted in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (h) Surplus property containing friable asbestos is to be neither donated nor sold. Such property is disposed of under paragraph (i) of this section.

        (i) Excess and surplus property containing friable asbestos is to be disposed of by burial in a site that meets the EPA requirements of 40 CFR 61.156.

The recipient agency must certify that it is authorized to procure the particular controlled substance and provide the registration number on the Certificate of Registration, issued by the DEA. See the transfer procedures in FMR part 102-36 (41 CFR part 102-36).

        (b) You must not donate controlled substances.

        (c) In accordance with sales procedures specified in part 102-38 of this subchapter, and under the conditions specified in this paragraph, you may sell controlled substances by sealed bid only, to bidders who have registered with the DEA to manufacture, distribute, or dispense of the particular controlled substance. As a condition of sale, the bidder must submit verification of DEA registration. Prior to finalizing the sale, you must obtain confirmation from the DEA of the bidder's status as a registered manufacturer, distributor or dispenser of controlled substances.

        (1) The invitation for bids for controlled substances must list only controlled substances and must only be distributed to bidders who are registered with the DEA, Department of Justice, to manufacture, distribute or dispense of the controlled substances being sold. In addition, the following statement, or an equivalent statement, must be included in the sales terms and conditions when selling controlled substances:

        (2) The following certification, or an equivalent certification, must be made a part of the invitation for bids and contract to be completed and signed by the bidder and returned with the bid. Failure to sign the certification may result in the bid being rejected as nonresponsive:

        (d) As a condition precedent to making an award for the sale of surplus controlled substances, holding agencies should follow procedures provided by the DEA in 21 CFR part 1310.

        § 102-40.165   How do we handle drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances?

#### § § 102-40.165

        (a) Drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances may be transferred to another Federal agency for official purposes under procedures specified in part 102-36 of this subchapter. For donation of drugs, biologicals, or reagents other than controlled substances, follow the procedures in part 102-37 of this subchapter, and paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) Drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances must be clearly identified when they are unfit for human use. As a general rule, you must destroy drugs, biologicals, and reagents unfit for human use, with destruction performed by an agency employee and witnessed and certified by two additional representatives of your agency. Similarly, destruction of this property held by a SASP or donee must be destroyed by a SASP employee and witnessed by two additional SASP employees. Destruction shall be coordinated with local air and water pollution control authorities, when required. However, you may report such property to GSA for subsequent transfer or donation for the purpose of animal experimental use when the property is unfit due to expired shelf life. The following certification, or an equivalent certification, must be used and retained by the Federal agency or SASP to document the destruction of drugs, biologicals, and reagents:

        (c) When donating drugs, biologicals, or reagents other than controlled substances, the SASP shall obtain a certification from the donee indicating that the items donated will be safeguarded, dispensed, and administered under competent supervision and in accordance with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents requested for donation by state agencies will not be transported by the state agency or stored in its warehouse prior to distribution to donees. Arrangements will be made by the state agency for the donee to make direct pickup at the holding agency after approval by GSA and after notification by the holding agency that the property is ready for pickup. Additionally, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, SF 123 from a state agency requesting surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents for donation will not be processed or approved by GSA until it has been determined by the GSA donation representative that the specific donee is legally licensed to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property. A copy of the donee's license, registration, or other legal authorization to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property should be attached and made a part of the SF 123. The administration or use of drugs, biologicals, and reagents must be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301, ).

        (d) The sale of any unexpired drugs, biologicals, or reagents must be in accordance with rules published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You may sell drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances, only to those entities legally qualified to engage in the sale, manufacture or distribution of such items and a certification or evidence of licensing must accompany the bids. An entity is legally qualified when a Federal agency ( the Department of Health and Human Services, the DEA, or the Department of Agriculture) or state agency having legal or regulatory oversight over that commodity has approved the entity to engage in the designated activity.

        (1) When selling drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than controlled substances, the following condition of sale (or an equivalent condition of sale) must be used:

        (2) The following certification, or an equivalent certification, must be made a part of the invitation for bids (and contract), to be completed and signed by the bidder, and returned with the bid with a copy of the bidder's license. Failure to sign the certification may result in the bid being rejected as nonresponsive.

        (b) Excess electronic products, certified and noncertified, meeting radiation safety performance standards or electronic products which are not required to meet such performance standards must be reported to GSA for transfer to Federal agencies in accordance with part 102-36 of this subchapter and may be donated or sold in accordance with parts 102-37 and 102-38 of this subchapter, respectively.

        (c) Excess electronic products NOT meeting radiation safety performance standards must be reported to GSA for transfer to Federal agencies in accordance with FMR part 102-36 (41 CFR part 102-36) and may be donated or sold in accordance with parts 102-37 and 102-38 of this subchapter, respectively. The report to GSA, and any subsequent transfer, donation, or sales documents, must include a statement that the items are not in compliance with applicable radiation safety performance standards and specify the standard which is not being met. Additionally, the recipient must acknowledge that they are aware of the potential danger in handling or using such items.

        (d) Donation documentation for items not meeting radiation safety performance standards must contain the following certification, or an equivalent certification, signed by the donee before release:

        (e) Sales documents listing electronic products not meeting safety performance standards must also clearly warn purchasers that the items may not be in compliance with FDA radiation safety performance standards prescribed pursuant to 21 CFR parts 1010 through 1050 and that the purchaser assumes all risks associated with the use or resale of the items. The following type of warning will be placed on the sales documentation:

        § 102-40.175   How do we handle firearms?

#### § § 102-40.175

        (a) You must submit reports and transfer documents on excess firearms to GSA (8QSC), Denver, CO 80225-0506. GSA will approve transfers of firearms only to those Federal agencies authorized to acquire firearms for official use, and may require additional written justification from the requesting agency.

        (b) GSA may donate only surplus hand guns, rifles, shotguns, and individual light automatic weapons previously used by the Federal Government, with less than .50 caliber in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) 1005, and rifle and shoulder fired grenade launchers in FSC 1010, with a disposal condition code of 4 or better (see condition codes in § 102-36.240 of this subchapter). Only eligible law enforcement entities whose primary function is the enforcement of applicable Federal, state, and/or local laws, and whose compensated law enforcement officers have powers to apprehend and arrest, may obtain these donated firearms for law enforcement purposes.

        (c)(1) For purposes of donation under paragraph (b) of this section, each Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property SF 123 must be accompanied by a conditional transfer document, signed by both the intended donee agency and the SASP, which includes the special terms, conditions, restrictions, and other forms or information required for the transfer of the donated firearms. Restrictions on donated firearms are perpetual and may not be amended by the SASP without prior written approval from GSA. Donated firearms must be released or shipped directly from the Federal donor agency to the designated donee.

        (2) If the firearms to be donated are subject to the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53, ( machineguns, silencers, short-barrel rifles, short-barrel shotguns, firearms over .50 caliber or with a bore diameter of more than   inch, and destructive devices) the SF 123 must be accompanied by an ATF Form 10, Application for Registration of Firearms Acquired by Certain Governmental Entities, completed by the donee agency as specified in 27 CFR 479.104. Upon approval of the donation by the SASP, the Form 10 shall be forwarded in accordance with the form's instructions. The Chief, National Firearms Act Branch, shall notify the donee agency of ATF registration of the donated firearms by returning the approved Form 10 to the donee agency. The donee agency shall provide a copy of the approved Form 10 to the SASP who shall retain a copy of the approved Form 10 and attach it to the SF 123. Firearms shall not be released for shipment until the ATF Form 10 has been approved by the ATF and a copy provided to the SASP. The registration of any firearms on ATF Form 10 is for official use only and subsequent transfers will be approved only to other Governmental entities for official use and in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If you have questions concerning whether particular firearms are subject to the National Firearms Act, contact the Firearms Technology Industry Services Branch, ATF, at (304) 616-4300 or

        (d) When authorized by circumstances described in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), or (i) of this section, the destruction of firearms must be performed by an entity authorized by your agency head or designee. The destruction must be witnessed by two additional agency employees authorized by the agency head or designee.

        (e)(1) When the approved donee agency no longer needs the donated firearms, the donee agency must notify the SASP. The SASP may, with GSA approval and in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, reassign firearms to another donee agency within the state or to a donee agency in another state through the appropriate SASP. In such a case, transfer of the firearms must be between eligible donee agencies only. No SASP is eligible to take custody of the firearms. If the firearms are not sought for reassignment, the donee agency and a representative from the SASP, or designee, must witness destruction of the firearms and complete and sign a certificate of destruction, which will be maintained by the SASP. If firearms subject to the National Firearms Act are destroyed, the SASP shall notify the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch, ATF, so the destruction can be noted in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.

        (2) If the firearms sought for reassignment are subject to the National Firearms Act, the firearms must be transferred in accordance with 27 CFR 479.90. This regulation requires that the donor agency submit an ATF Form 5, Application for Tax Exempt Transfer and Registration of Firearm, which must be approved prior to transfer of the firearms. Donor agencies wishing to reassign firearms subject to the National Firearms Act shall submit a completed ATF Form 5 to the SASP along with the request to reassign the firearms to another donee agency. The SASP shall forward the ATF Form 5 to the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch. If transfer is approved by the ATF, the donor agency will receive a copy of the Form 5, with approval noted thereon, from the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch, ATF. The donor agency shall provide a copy of the approved Form 5 to the SASP at which time the reassignment shall be approved.

        (f) You must not abandon firearms. You must destroy unneeded firearms by crushing, cutting, breaking, or deforming each firearm in a manner to ensure that each firearm is rendered completely inoperative and incapable of being made operable for any purpose except the recovery of basic material content. Destruction of firearms must be performed as stated in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

        (g) You must not dispose of functional or repairable firearms under an exchange/sale transaction or by sale. Surplus firearms may be sold only for scrap after total destruction as described in paragraph (f) of this section to ensure that the firearms are rendered completely inoperative and to preclude their being made operative. Such sale shall be conducted under part 102-38 of this subchapter.

        (h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, firearms received as foreign gifts may be offered for transfer to Federal agencies or sold to the gift recipient in accordance with part 102-42 of this subchapter. If sold to the gift recipient, a certification signed by the gift recipient certifying compliance with all Federal, state, and local laws regarding purchase and possession of firearms must be received by the gift recipient's agency and the agency conducting the sale prior to the sale and release of such firearm to the gift recipient.

        (2) Firearms subject to the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53 that are received as foreign gifts cannot be lawfully transferred to an individual gift recipient. These firearms must remain the property of the United States or may be transferred to a donee agency in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. In addition, all firearms must also be transferred, shipped, received, and possessed in accordance with the Gun Control Act of 1968. Persons having questions concerning compliance with the Gun Control Act should contact the nearest ATF field office.

        (i) Firearms that are forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed as described in 40 U.S.C. 1306 and 40 U.S.C. 552, must be reported to GSA for disposal in accordance with § 102-41.195 of this subchapter. GSA will direct the disposition of these firearms under this section.

        Responsibility

          § 102-41.25   Who retains custody and is responsible for the reporting, care, and handling of property covered by this part?

#### § § 102-41.25

          You, the holding agency, normally retain physical custody of the property and are responsible for its care and handling pending final disposition. With the exception of property listed in § 102-41.35, you must report promptly to the GSA forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed personal property not being retained for official use and seized property on which proceedings for forfeiture by court decree are being started or have begun. In general, the procedures for reporting such property parallel those for reporting excess personal property under part 102-36 of this subchapter B.

#### § § 102-41.30

          (a)  (1) If the seizing agency files a request for the property for its official use, the GSA Region 3/National Capital Region will apply to the court for an order to turn the property over to the agency should forfeiture be decreed. If no such request has been filed, GSA will determine whether retention of the property for Federal official use is in the Government's best interest, and, if so, will apply to the court to order delivery of the property to—

          (i) Any other Federal agency that requests it; or

          (ii) The seizing agency to be retained for a reasonable time in case the property may later become necessary to any agency for official use.

          (2) In the event that the property is not ordered by competent authority to be forfeited to the United States, it may be returned to the claimant.

          (b)  When forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed property is reported to GSA for disposal, GSA will direct its disposition by—

          (1) Transfer to another Federal agency;

          (2) Donation to an eligible recipient, if the property is not needed by a Federal agency and there are no requirements for reimbursement to satisfy the claims of owners, lien holders, or other lawful claimants;

          (3) Sale; or

          (4) Abandonment and destruction in accordance with § 102-36.305 of this subchapter B.

          § 102-41.35   Do we report to GSA all seized personal property subject to judicial forfeiture as well as forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed personal property not retained for official use?

#### § § 102-41.35

        § 102-41.45   May we place seized personal property into official use before the forfeiture process is completed?

#### § § 102-41.45

Except for the items noted in § 102-41.35, report to GSA all forfeited personal property not being retained for official use.

        § 102-41.55   Where do we send the reports for seized or forfeited personal property?

#### § § 102-41.55

        (a) Whether the property—

        (1) Was forfeited in a judicial proceeding or administratively (without going through a court);

        (2) Is subject to pending court proceedings for forfeiture, and, if so, the name of the defendant, the place and judicial district of the court from which the decree will be issued, and whether you wish to retain the property for official use;

        (b) The report or case number under which the property is listed; and

#### § § 102-41.65

        Except for drug paraphernalia (see §§ 102-41.210 through 102-41.235), forfeited personal property retained for official use or transferred to another Federal agency under this subpart loses its identity as forfeited property. When no longer required for official use, you must report it to GSA as excess for disposal in accordance with part 102-36 of this subchapter B. You must follow the additional provisions of subpart E of this part and part 101-42 of Chapter 101, Federal Property Management Regulations in this title when disposing of firearms, distilled spirits, wine, beer, and drug paraphernalia.

        Recipient agencies do not pay for the property. However, you may charge the recipient agency all costs you incurred in storing, packing, loading, preparing for shipment, and transporting the property.

Any payment due to lien holders or other lawful claimants under a judicial forfeiture must be made in accordance with provisions of the court decree.

        § 102-41.75   May we retain the proceeds from the sale of forfeited personal property?

#### § § 102-41.75

        No, you must deposit the sales proceeds in the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, unless otherwise directed by court decree or specifically authorized by statute.

      Subpart C—Voluntarily Abandoned Personal Property

        § 102-41.80   When is personal property voluntarily abandoned?

#### § § 102-41.80

        Personal property is voluntarily abandoned when the owner of the property intentionally and voluntarily gives up title to such property and title vests in the Government. The receiving agency ordinarily documents receipt of the property to evidence its voluntary relinquishment. Evidence of the voluntary abandonment may be circumstantial.

          (b) Decorations that have been offered or awarded for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance. If the employing agency disapproves retention of the decoration by the employee, the decoration becomes the property of the U.S. Government.

          (4) If GSA does not transfer the gift or decoration during Federal utilization screening, the employee may purchase the gift or decoration (see § 102-42.140).

          (5) If the employee declines to purchase the gift or decoration, and there is no Federal requirement for either, GSA may offer it for donation through State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASP) under part 102-37 of this subchapter B.

          (6) If no SASP requests the gift or decoration for donation, GSA may offer it for public sale, with the approval of the Secretary of State, or will authorize the destruction of the gift or decoration under part 102-38 of this subchapter B.

          (b)  When an employee receives a monetary gift above the minimal value:

Prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasing buildings (or sites for such buildings), Federal agencies must use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties available to the agency. In site selections, Executive agencies must consider Executive Order 12072 (August 16, 1978, 43 FR 36869) and Executive Order 13006 (40 U.S.C. 3306 note). In addition, Executive agencies must consider all of the following:

          (a) Encourages and expedites the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners;

          (b) Avoids litigation, including condemnation actions, where possible and relieves congestion in the courts;

          (c) Provides for consistent treatment of owners; and

          (d) Promotes public confidence in Federal land acquisition practices.

          § 102-73.265   What actions must Federal agencies take to facilitate land acquisition?

#### § § 102-73.265

          To facilitate land acquisition, Federal agencies must, among other things—

          (a) Appraise the real property before starting negotiations and give the owner (or the owner's representative) the opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the inspection;

          (b) Establish an amount estimated to be the just compensation before starting negotiations and promptly offer to acquire the property for this full amount;

          (c) Try to negotiate with owners on the price;

          (d) Pay the agreed purchase price to the property owner, or in the case of a condemnation, deposit payment in the registry of the court, for the benefit of the owner, before requiring the owner to surrender the property; and

          (e) Provide property owners (and occupants) at least 90 days' notice of displacement before requiring anyone to move. If a Federal agency permits the owner to keep possession for a short time after acquiring the owner's property, Federal agencies must not charge rent in excess of the property's fair rental value to a short-term occupier.

        Just Compensation

          § 102-73.270   Are Federal agencies required to provide the owner with a written statement of the amount established as just compensation?

#### § § 102-73.270

          Yes, Federal agencies must provide the owner with a written statement of this amount and summarize the basis for it. When it is appropriate, Federal agencies must separately state the just compensation for the property to be acquired and damages to the remaining real property.

          § 102-73.275   What specific information must be included in the summary statement for the owner that explains the basis for just compensation?

          (b) Identify the buildings, structures, and other improvements the Federal agency considers part of the real property for which just compensation is being offered;

          (c) State that the Federal agency based the estimate of just compensation on the Government's estimate of the property's fair market value. If only part of a property or less than a full interest is being acquired, Federal agencies must explain how they determined the just compensation for it; and

          (d) State that the Government's estimate of just compensation is at least as much as the property's approved appraisal value.

          § 102-73.280   Where can Federal agencies find guidance on how to appraise the value of properties being acquired by the Federal Government?

#### § § 102-73.280

          The Interagency Land Acquisition Conference has developed, promulgated, and adopted the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, sometimes referred to as the “Yellow Book.” The Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, established on November 27, 1968, by invitation of the Attorney General, is a voluntary organization composed of the many Federal agencies engaged in the acquisition of real estate for public uses. The “Yellow Book” is published by the Appraisal Institute in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice and is available in hard copy or on the Department of Justice's internet Web site at

          Yes, Federal agencies must not—

          (a) Duplicate any payment to the tenant otherwise authorized by law; and

          (b) Pay a tenant unless the landowner disclaims all interests in the tenant's improvements. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant must assign, transfer, and release to the Federal agency all of its right, title, and interest in the improvements. The tenant may reject such payment under this subpart and obtain payment for its property interests according to other sections of applicable law.

        Expenses Incidental to Property Transfer

          § 102-73.295   What property transfer expenses must Federal agencies cover when acquiring real property?

#### § § 102-73.295

          Federal agencies must—

          (a) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually incurred for recording fees, transfer taxes, documentary stamps, evidence of title, boundary surveys, legal descriptions of the real property, and similar expenses needed to convey the property to the Federal Government;

          (b) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually incurred for penalty costs and other charges to prepay any existing, recorded mortgage that a property owner entered into in good faith and that encumbers the real property;

          (c) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually incurred for the prorated part of any prepaid real property taxes that cover the period after the Federal Government gets title to the property or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier; and

          (d) Whenever possible, directly pay the costs identified in this section, so property owners will not have to pay them and then seek reimbursement from the Government.

        Litigation Expenses

          § 102-73.300   Are Federal agencies required to pay for litigation expenses incurred by a property owner because of a condemnation proceeding?

#### § § 102-73.300

Appropriate relocation assistance means that the Federal agency must pay the displaced person for actual—

          (a) Reasonable moving expenses (in moving himself, his family, and business);

          (b) Direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business;

          (c) Reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm; and

          (d) Reasonable expenses necessary to reestablish a displaced farm, nonprofit organization, or small business at its new site, but not to exceed $10,000.

#### § § 102-74.335

          Federal agency building managers are responsible for furnishing and installing suitable, uniform signs in the building, and in and around building entrance doorways and air intake ducts, reading “No Smoking,” “No Smoking Except in Designated Areas,” “No Smoking Within 25 Feet of Doorway,” or “No Smoking Within 25 Feet of Air Duct,” as applicable.

> [73 FR 77518, Dec. 19, 2008]

          § 102-74.340   Who is responsible for monitoring and controlling areas designated for smoking by an agency head and for identifying those areas with proper signage?

#### § § 102-74.340

          Agency heads are responsible for monitoring and controlling areas designated by them under § 102-74.320(d) for smoking and identifying these areas with proper signage. Suitable, uniform signs reading “Designated Smoking Area” must be furnished and installed by the occupant agency.

> [73 FR 77518, Dec. 19, 2008]

          § 102-74.345   Does the smoking policy in this part apply to the judicial branch?

#### § § 102-74.345

          This smoking policy applies to the judicial branch when it occupies space in buildings controlled by the executive branch. Furthermore, the Federal Chief Judge in a local jurisdiction may be deemed to be comparable to an agency head and may establish exceptions for Federal jurors and others as provided in § 102-74.320(d).

> [73 FR 77518, Dec. 19, 2008]

          § 102-74.350   Are agencies required to meet their obligations under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act where there is an exclusive representative for the employees prior to implementing this smoking policy?

#### § § 102-74.350

          Yes. Where there is an exclusive representative for the employees, Federal agencies must meet their obligations under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. Ch. 71, Labor-Management Relations, prior to implementing this section. In all other cases, agencies may consult directly with employees.

> [73 FR 77518, Dec. 19, 2008]

          § 102-74.351   If a state or local government has a smoke-free ordinance that is more strict than the smoking policy for Federal facilities, does the state or local law or Federal policy control?

#### § § 102-74.351

          The answer depends on whether the facility is Federally owned or privately owned. If the facility is Federally owned, then Federal preemption principles apply and the Federal policy controls. If the facility is privately owned, then Federal tenants are subject to the provisions of the state or local ordinance, even in the Federally leased space, if the state or local restrictions are more stringent than the Federal policy.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        Real Property Disposal Services

          § 102-75.15   What real property disposal services must agencies provide under a delegation of authority from GSA?

#### § § 102-75.15

          Disposal agencies must provide real property disposal services for real property assets under their custody and control, such as the utilization of excess property, surveys, and the disposal of surplus property, which includes public benefit conveyances, negotiated sales, public sales, related disposal services, and appraisals.

          § 102-75.20   How can Federal agencies with independent disposal authority obtain related disposal services?

#### § § 102-75.20

          Federal agencies with independent disposal authority are encouraged to obtain utilization, disposal, and related services from those agencies with expertise in real property disposal, such as GSA, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 1535 (the Economy Act), so that they can remain focused on their core mission.

        § 102-75.5   What is the scope of this part?

#### § § 102-75.5

        The real property policies contained in this part apply to Federal agencies, including GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS), operating under, or subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General Services. Federal agencies with authority to dispose of real property under Subchapter III of Chapter 5 of Title 40 of the United States Code will be referred to as “disposal agencies” in this part. Except in rare instances where GSA delegates disposal authority to a Federal agency, the “disposal agency” as used in this part refers to GSA.

        § 102-75.10   What basic real property disposal policy governs disposal agencies?

#### § § 102-75.10

        Disposal agencies must provide, in a timely, efficient, and cost effective manner, the full range of real estate services necessary to support their real property utilization and disposal needs. Landholding agencies must survey the real property under their custody or control to identify property that is not utilized, underutilized, or not being put to optimum use. Disposal agencies must have adequate procedures in place to promote the effective utilization and disposal of such real property.

      Subpart B—Utilization of Excess Real Property

        Standards

          § 102-75.40   What are the standards that each Executive agency must use to identify unneeded Federal real property?

#### § § 102-75.40

          Each Executive agency must identify unneeded Federal property using the following standards:

          (a) Not utilized.

          (b) Underutilized.

          (c) Not being put to optimum use.

          § 102-75.45   What does the term “Not utilized” mean?

#### § § 102-75.45

          Not utilized means an entire property or portion thereof, with or without improvements, not occupied for current program purposes of the accountable Executive agency, or occupied in caretaker status only.

          § 102-75.50   What does the term “Underutilized” mean?

#### § § 102-75.50

          Underutilized means an entire property or portion thereof, with or without improvements, which is used—

          (a) Irregularly or intermittently by the accountable Executive agency for current program purposes of that agency; or

          (b) For current program purposes that can be satisfied with only a portion of the property.

          § 102-75.55   What does the term “Not being put to optimum use” mean?

#### § § 102-75.55

          Not being put to optimum use means an entire property or portion thereof, with or without improvements, which—

          (a) Even though used for current program purposes, the nature, value, or location of the property is such that it could be utilized for a different and significantly higher and better purpose; or

          (b) The costs of occupying are substantially higher than other suitable properties that could be made available through transfer, purchase, or lease with total net savings to the Government, after considering property values, costs of moving, occupancy, operational efficiency, environmental effects, regional planning, and employee morale.

        Guidelines

          § 102-75.60   What are landholding agencies' responsibilities concerning real property surveys?

#### § § 102-75.60

          A landholding agency's responsibilities concerning real property utilization surveys are to—

          (a) Survey real property under its control (i.e., property reported on its financial statements) at least annually to identify property that is not utilized, underutilized, or not being put to optimum use. When other needs for the property are identified or recognized, the agency must determine whether continuation of the current use or another use would better serve the public interest, considering both the Federal agency's needs and the property's location. In conducting annual reviews of their property holdings, the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal can provide guidelines for Executive agencies to consider in identifying unneeded Federal real property;

          (b) Maintain its inventory of real property at the absolute minimum consistent with economical and efficient conduct of the affairs of the agency; and

          (c) Promptly report to GSA real property that it has determined to be excess.

          § 102-75.65   Why is it important for Executive agencies to notify the disposal agency of its real property needs?

#### § § 102-75.65

          It is important that each Executive agency notify the disposal agency of its real property needs to determine whether the excess or surplus property of another agency is available that would meet its need and prevent the unnecessary purchase or lease of real property.

          § 102-75.70   Are there any exceptions to this notification policy?

#### § § 102-75.70

          Yes, Executive agencies are not required to notify the disposal agency when an agency's proposed acquisition of real property is dictated by such factors as exact geographical location, topography, engineering, or similar characteristics that limit the possible use of other available property. For example, Executive agencies are not required to notify disposal agencies concerning the acquisition of real property for a dam site, reservoir area, or the construction of a generating plant or a substation, since specific lands are needed, which limit the possible use of other available property. Therefore, no useful purpose would be served by notifying the disposal agency.

          § 102-75.75   What is the most important consideration in evaluating a proposed transfer of excess real property?

#### § § 102-75.75

          In every case of a proposed transfer of excess real property, the most important consideration is the validity and appropriateness of the requirement upon which the proposal is based. Also, a proposed transfer must not establish a new program that has never been reflected in any previous budget submission or congressional action. Additionally, a proposed transfer must not substantially increase the level of an agency's existing programs beyond that which has been contemplated in the President's budget or by the Congress.

          (Note: See Subpart I—Screening of Excess Federal Real Property (§§ 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on screening and transfer requests.)

          § 102-75.80   What are an Executive agency's responsibilities before requesting a transfer of excess real property?

#### § § 102-75.80

          Before requesting a transfer of excess real property, an Executive agency must—

          (a) Screen its own property holdings to determine whether the new requirement can be met through improved utilization of existing real property; however, the utilization must be for purposes that are consistent with the highest and best use of the property under consideration;

          (b) Review all real property under its accountability that has been permitted or outleased and terminate the permit or lease for any property, or portion thereof, suitable for the proposed need, if termination is not prohibited by the terms of the permit or lease;

          (c) Utilize property that is or can be made available under § 102-75.80(a) or (b) for the proposed need in lieu of requesting a transfer of excess real property and reassign the property, when appropriate;

          (d) Confirm that the appraised fair market value of the excess real property proposed for transfer will not substantially exceed the probable purchase price of other real property that would be suitable for the intended purpose;

          (e) Limit the size and quantity of excess real property to be transferred to the actual requirements and separate, if possible, other portions of the excess installation for possible disposal to other agencies or to the public; and

          (f) Consider the design, layout, geographic location, age, state of repair, and expected maintenance costs of excess real property proposed for transfer; agencies must be able to demonstrate that the transfer will be more economical over a sustained period of time than the acquisition of a new facility specifically planned for the purpose.

          § 102-75.85   Can disposal agencies transfer excess real property to agencies for programs that appear to be scheduled for substantial curtailment or termination?

#### § § 102-75.85

          Yes, but only on a temporary basis with the condition that the property will be released for further Federal utilization or disposal as surplus property at an agreed upon time when the transfer is arranged.

          § 102-75.90   How is excess real property needed for office, storage, and related purposes normally transferred to the requesting agency?

#### § § 102-75.90

          GSA may temporarily assign or direct the use of such excess real property to the requesting agency. See § 102-75.240.

          § 102-75.95   Can Federal agencies that normally do not require real property (other than for office, storage, and related purposes) or that may not have statutory authority to acquire such property, obtain the use of excess real property?

#### § § 102-75.95

          Yes, GSA can authorize the use of excess real property for an approved program. See § 102-75.240.

        Land Withdrawn or Reserved From the Public Domain

          § 102-75.100   When an agency holds land withdrawn or reserved from the public domain and determines that it no longer needs this land, what must it do?

#### § § 102-75.100

          An agency holding unneeded land withdrawn or reserved from the public domain must submit to the appropriate GSA Regional Office a Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), with appropriate Schedules A, B, and C, only when—

          (a) It has filed a notice of intention to relinquish with the Department of the Interior (43 CFR part 2372 ) and sent a copy of the notice to the appropriate GSA Regional Office;

          (b) The Department of the Interior has notified the agency that the Secretary of the Interior has determined that the lands are not suitable for return to the public domain for disposition under the general public land laws because the lands are substantially changed in character by improvements or otherwise; and

          (c) The Department of the Interior provides a report identifying whether or not any other agency claims primary, joint, or secondary jurisdiction over the lands and whether its records show that the lands are encumbered by rights or privileges under the public land laws.

          § 102-75.105   What responsibility does the Department of the Interior have if it determines that minerals in the land are unsuitable for disposition under the public land mining and mineral leasing laws?

#### § § 102-75.105

          In such cases, the Department of the Interior must—

          (a) Notify the appropriate GSA Regional Office of such a determination; and

          (b) Authorize the landholding agency to identify in the Standard Form 118 any minerals in the land that the Department of the Interior determines to be unsuitable for disposition under the public land mining and mineral leasing laws.

        Transfers Under Other Laws

          § 102-75.110   Can transfers of real property be made under authority of laws other than those codified in Title 40 of the United States Code?

#### § § 102-75.110

          Yes, the provisions of this section shall not apply to transfers of real property authorized to be made by 40 U.S.C. 113(e) or by any special statute that directs or requires an Executive agency to transfer or convey specifically described real property in accordance with the provisions of that statute. Transfers of real property must be made only under the authority of Title 40 of the United States Code, unless the independent authority granted to such agency specifically exempts the authority from the requirements of Title 40.

        Reporting of Excess Real Property

          § 102-75.115   Must reports of excess real property and related personal property be prepared on specific forms?

#### § § 102-75.115

          Yes, landholding agencies must prepare reports of excess real property and related personal property on—

          (a) Standard Form 118, Report of Excess Real Property, and accompanying Standard Form 118a, Buildings Structures, Utilities, and Miscellaneous Facilities, Schedule A;

          (b) Standard Form 118b, Land, Schedule B; and

          (c) Standard Form 118c, Related Personal Property, Schedule C.

          § 102-75.120   Is there any other information that needs to accompany (or be submitted with) the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)?

#### § § 102-75.120

          Yes, in all cases where Government-owned land is reported excess, Executive agencies must include a title report, prepared or approved by a qualified employee of the landholding agency, documenting the Government's title to the property.

        Title Report

          § 102-75.125   What information must agencies include in the title report?

#### § § 102-75.125

          When completing the title report, agencies must include—

          (a) The description of the property;

          (b) The date title vested in the United States;

          (c) All exceptions, reservations, conditions, and restrictions, relating to the title;

          (d) Detailed information concerning any action, thing, or circumstance that occurred from the date the United States acquired the property to the date of the report that in any way affected or may have affected the United States' right, title, or interest in and to the real property (including copies of legal comments or opinions discussing the manner in which and the extent to which such right, title, or interest may have been affected). In the absence of any such action, thing, or circumstance, a statement to that effect must be made a part of the report;

          (e) The status of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the land that is peculiar to the property by reason of it being Government-owned land. In the absence of any special circumstances, a statement to that effect must be made a part of the report;

          (f) Detailed information regarding any known flood hazards or flooding of the property, and, if the property is located in a flood-plain or on wetlands, a listing of restricted uses (along with the citations) identified in Federal, State, or local regulations as required by Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 of May 24, 1977;

          (g) The specific identification and description of fixtures and related personal property that have possible historic or artistic value;

          (h) The historical significance of the property and whether the property is listed, is eligible for, or has been nominated for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or is in proximity to a property listed in the National Register. If the landholding agency is aware of any effort by the public to have the property listed in the National Register, it must also include this information;

          (i) A description of the type, location, and condition of asbestos incorporated in the construction, repair, or alteration of any building or improvement on the property (e.g., fire-proofing, pipe insulation, etc.) and a description of any asbestos control measures taken for the property. Agencies must also provide to GSA any available indication of costs and/or time necessary to remove all or any portion of the asbestos-containing materials. Agencies are not required to conduct any specific studies and/or tests to obtain this information. (The provisions of this subpart do not apply to asbestos on Federal property that is subject to section 120(h) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, Public Law 99-499);

          (j) A statement indicating whether or not lead-based paint is present on the property. Additionally, if the property is target housing (all housing except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities or any zero bedroom dwelling) constructed prior to 1978, provide a risk assessment and paint inspection report that details all lead-based paint hazards; and

          (k) A statement indicating whether or not, during the time the property was owned by the United States, any hazardous substance activity, as defined by regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 373, took place on the property. Hazardous substance activity includes situations where any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, known to have been released, or disposed of on the property. Agencies reporting such property must review the regulations issued by EPA at 40 CFR part 373 for details on the information required and must comply with these requirements. In addition, agencies reporting such property shall review and comply with the regulations for the utilization and disposal of hazardous materials and certain categories of property set forth at 41 CFR part 101-42.

          § 102-75.130   If hazardous substance activity took place on the property, what specific information must an agency include in the title report?

#### § § 102-75.130

          If hazardous substance activity took place on the property, the reporting agency must include information on the type and quantity of such hazardous substance and the time at which such storage, release, or disposal took place. The reporting agency must also advise the disposal agency if all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such hazardous substance activity was taken before the date the property was reported excess. If such action was not taken, the reporting agency must advise the disposal agency when such action will be completed or how the agency expects to comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in the disposal. See §§ 102-75.340 and 102-75.345.

          § 102-75.135   If no hazardous substance activity took place on the property, what specific information must an agency include in the title report?

#### § § 102-75.135

          If no hazardous substance activity took place, the reporting agency must include the following statement:

        Other Necessary Information

          § 102-75.140   In addition to the title report, and all necessary environmental information and certifications, what information must an Executive agency transmit with the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)?

#### § § 102-75.140

          Executive agencies must provide—

          (a) A legible, reproducible copy of all instruments in possession of the agency that affect the United States' right, title, or interest in the property reported or the use and operation of such property (including agreements covering and licenses to use, any patents, processes, techniques, or inventions). If it is impracticable to transmit the abstracts of title and related title evidence, agencies must provide the name and address of the custodian of such documents in the title report referred to in § 102-75.120;

          (b) Any appraisal reports indicating or providing the fair market value or the fair annual rental of the property, if requested by the disposal agency; and

          (c) A certification by a responsible person that the property does or does not contain polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformers or other equipment regulated by EPA under 40 CFR part 761, if requested by the disposal agency. If the property does contain any equipment subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR part 761, the certification must include the landholding agency's assurance that each piece of equipment is now and will continue to be in compliance with the EPA regulations until disposal of the property.

        Examination for Acceptability

          § 102-75.145   Is GSA required to review each report of excess?

#### § § 102-75.145

          Yes, GSA must review each report of excess to ascertain whether the report was prepared according to the provisions of this part. GSA must notify the landholding agency, in writing, whether the report is acceptable or other information is needed within 15 calendar days after receipt of the report.

          § 102-75.150   What happens when GSA determines that the report of excess is adequate?

#### § § 102-75.150

          When GSA determines that a report is adequate, GSA will accept the report and inform the landholding agency of the acceptance date. However, the landholding agency must, upon request, promptly furnish any additional information or documents relating to the property required by GSA to accomplish a transfer or a disposal.

          § 102-75.155   What happens if GSA determines that the report of excess is insufficient?

#### § § 102-75.155

          Where GSA determines that a report is insufficient, GSA will return the report and inform the landholding agency of the facts and circumstances that make the report insufficient. The landholding agency must promptly take appropriate action to submit an acceptable report to GSA. If the landholding agency is unable to submit an acceptable report, the property will no longer be considered as excess property and the disposal agency will cease activity for the disposal of the property. However, GSA may accept the report of excess on a conditional basis and identify what deficiencies in the report must be corrected in order for the report to gain full acceptance.

        Designation as Personal Property

          § 102-75.160   Should prefabricated movable structures be designated real or personal property for disposition purposes?

#### § § 102-75.160

          Prefabricated movable structures such as Butler-type storage warehouses, Quonset huts, and house trailers (with or without undercarriages) reported to GSA along with the land on which they are located may, at GSA's discretion, be designated for disposition as personal property for off-site use or as real property for disposal with the land.

          § 102-75.165   Should related personal property be designated real or personal property for disposition purposes?

#### § § 102-75.165

          Related personal property may, at the disposal agency's discretion, be designated as personal property for disposal purposes. However, for fine artwork and sculptures, GSA's policy is that artwork specifically created for a Federal building is considered as a fixture of the building. This also applies to sculptures created for a Federal building or a public park. Disposal agencies must follow the policies and guidance for disposal of artwork and sculptures developed by the GSA Office of the Chief Architect, Center for Design Excellence and the Arts, and the Bulletin dated March 26, 1934, entitled “Legal Title to Works Produced under the Public Works of Art Project.”

          § 102-75.170   What happens to the related personal property in a structure scheduled for demolition?

#### § § 102-75.170

          When a structure is to be demolished, any fixtures or related personal property therein may, at the disposal agency's discretion, be designated for disposition as personal property where a ready disposition can be made of these items. As indicated in § 102-75.165, particular consideration should be given to designating items having possible historical or artistic value as personal property.

        Transfers

          § 102-75.175   What are GSA's responsibilities regarding transfer requests?

#### § § 102-75.175

          Before property can be transferred among Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the municipal government of the District of Columbia, GSA must determine that—

          (a) The transfer is in the best interest of the Government;

          (b) The requesting agency is the appropriate agency to hold the property; and

          (c) The proposed land use will maximize use of the real property, in terms of economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of real property.

          (Note: See Subpart I—Screening of Excess Federal Real Property (§§ 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on screening and transfer requests.)

          § 102-75.180   May landholding agencies transfer excess real property without notifying GSA?

#### § § 102-75.180

          Landholding agencies may, without notifying GSA, transfer excess real property that they use, occupy, or control under a lease, permit, license, easement, or similar instrument when—

          (a) The lease or other instrument is subject to termination by the grantor or owner of the premises within nine months;

          (b) The remaining term of the lease or other instrument, including renewal rights, will provide for less than nine months of use and occupancy; or

          (c) The lease or other instrument provides for use and occupancy of space for office, storage, and related facilities, which does not exceed a total of 2,500 square feet.

          § 102-75.185   In those instances where landholding agencies may transfer excess real property without notifying GSA, which policies must they follow?

#### § § 102-75.185

          In those instances, landholding agencies must transfer property following the policies in this subpart.

          § 102-75.190   What amount must the transferee agency pay for the transfer of excess real property?

#### § § 102-75.190

          The transferee agency must pay an amount equal to the property's fair market value (determined by the Administrator)—

          (a) Where the transferor agency has requested the net proceeds of the transfer pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 574; or

          (b) Where either the transferor or transferee agency (or organizational unit affected) is subject to the Government Corporation Control Act (31 U.S.C. 841), is a mixed-ownership Government corporation, or the municipal government of the District of Columbia.

          § 102-75.195   If the transferor agency is a wholly owned Government corporation, what amount must the transferee agency pay?

#### § § 102-75.195

          As may be agreed upon by GSA and the corporation, the transferee agency must pay an amount equal to—

          (a) The estimated fair market value of the property; or

          (b) The corporation's book value of the property.

          § 102-75.200   What amount must the transferee agency pay if property is being transferred for the purpose of upgrading the transferee agency's facilities?

#### § § 102-75.200

          Where the transfer is for the purpose of upgrading facilities (i.e., for the purpose of replacing other property of the transferee agency, which because of the location, nature, or condition thereof, is less efficient for use), the transferee must pay an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the property to be replaced and the fair market value of the property requested, as determined by the Administrator.

          § 102-75.205   Are transfers ever made without reimbursement by the transferee agency?

#### § § 102-75.205

          Transfers may be made without reimbursement by the transferee agency only if—

          (a) Congress has specifically authorized the transfer without reimbursement, or

          (b) The Administrator, with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has approved a request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement.

          § 102-75.210   What must a transferee agency include in its request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

#### § § 102-75.210

          The request must include an explanation of how granting the exception would further essential agency program objectives and at the same time be consistent with Executive Order 12512, Federal Real Property Management, dated April 29, 1985. The transferee agency must attach the explanation to the Request for Transfer of Excess Real and Related Personal Property (GSA Form 1334) prior to submitting the form to GSA. The unavailability of funds alone is not sufficient to justify an exception.

          § 102-75.215   Who must endorse requests for exception to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

#### § § 102-75.215

          Agency heads must endorse requests for exceptions to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement.

          § 102-75.220   Where should an agency send a request for exception to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

#### § § 102-75.220

          Agencies must submit all requests for exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement to the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office.

          § 102-75.225   Who must review and approve a request for exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

#### § § 102-75.225

          The Administrator must review all requests for exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement. If the Administrator approves the request, it is then submitted to OMB for final concurrence. If OMB approves the request, then GSA may complete the transfer.

          § 102-75.230   Who is responsible for property protection and maintenance costs while the request for exception is being reviewed?

#### § § 102-75.230

          The agency requesting the property will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance costs not more than 40 days from the date of the Administrator's letter to OMB requesting concurrence for an exception to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement. If the request is denied, the requesting agency may pay the fair market value for the property or withdraw its request. If the request is withdrawn, responsibility for protection and maintenance cost will return to the landholding agency at that time.

          § 102-75.235   May disposal agencies transfer excess property to the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol?

#### § § 102-75.235

          Yes, disposal agencies may transfer excess property to the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under his or her direction, pursuant to the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 113(d). The amount of reimbursement for such transfer must be the same as would be required for a transfer of excess property to an Executive agency under similar circumstances.

        Temporary Utilization

          § 102-75.240   May excess real property be temporarily assigned/reassigned?

#### § § 102-75.240

          Yes, whenever GSA determines that it is more advantageous to assign property temporarily rather than permanently, it may do so. If the space is for office, storage, or related facilities, GSA will determine the length of the assignment/reassignment. Agencies are required to reimburse the landholding agency (or GSA, if GSA has become responsible for seeking an appropriation for protection and maintenance expenses) (see § 102-75.970) for protection and maintenance expenses. GSA may also temporarily assign/reassign excess real property for uses other than storage, office or related facilities. In such cases, the agency receiving the temporary assignment may be required to pay a rental or users charge based upon the fair market value of the property, as determined by GSA. If the property will be required by the agency for a period of more than 1 year, it may be transferred on a conditional basis, with an understanding that the property will be reported excess at an agreed upon time (see § 102-75.85). The requesting agency is responsible for protection and maintenance expenses.

        Non-Federal Interim Use of Excess Property

          § 102-75.245   When can landholding agencies grant rights for non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA?

#### § § 102-75.245

          Landholding agencies, upon approval from GSA, may grant rights for non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA, when it is determined that such excess property is not required for the needs of any Federal agency and when the interim use will not impair the ability to dispose of the property.

        § 102-75.25   What are landholding agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of excess property?

#### § § 102-75.25

        Landholding agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of excess property are to—

        (a) Achieve maximum use of their real property, in terms of economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of real property;

        (b) Increase the identification and reporting of their excess real property; and

        (c) Fulfill its needs for real property, so far as practicable, by utilization of real property determined excess by other agencies, pursuant to the provision of this part, before it purchases non-Federal real property.

        § 102-75.30   What are disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of excess property?

#### § § 102-75.30

        Disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of excess property are to—

        (a) Provide for the transfer of excess real property among Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the municipal government of the District of Columbia; and

        (b) Resolve conflicting requests for transferring real property that the involved agencies cannot resolve.

        § 102-75.35   [Reserved]

#### § § 102-75.35

      Subpart C—Surplus Real Property Disposal

        Applicability of Antitrust Laws

          § 102-75.270   Must antitrust laws be considered when disposing of property?

#### § § 102-75.270

          Yes, antitrust laws must be considered in any case in which there is contemplated a disposal to any private interest of—

          (a) Real and related personal property that has an estimated fair market value of $3 million or more; or

          (b) Patents, processes, techniques, or inventions, irrespective of cost.

          § 102-75.275   Who determines whether the proposed disposal would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with antitrust laws?

#### § § 102-75.275

          The Attorney General determines whether the proposed disposal would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with antitrust laws.

          § 102-75.280   What information concerning a proposed disposal must a disposal agency provide to the Attorney General to determine the applicability of antitrust laws?

#### § § 102-75.280

          The disposal agency must promptly provide the Attorney General with notice of any such proposed disposal and the probable terms or conditions, as required by 40 U.S.C. 559. If notice is given by any disposal agency other than GSA, a copy of the notice must also be provided simultaneously to the GSA Regional Office in which the property is located. Upon request, a disposal agency must furnish information that the Attorney General believes to be necessary in determining whether the proposed disposition or any other disposition of surplus real property violates or would violate any of the antitrust laws.

          § 102-75.285   Can a disposal agency dispose of real property to a private interest specified in § 102-75.270 before advice is received from the Attorney General?

#### § § 102-75.285

          No, advice from the Attorney General must be received before disposing of real property.

        Disposals Under Other Laws

          § 102-75.290   Can disposals of real property be made under authority of laws other than Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code?

#### § § 102-75.290

          Except for disposals specifically authorized by special legislation, disposals of real property must be made only under the authority of Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code. However, the Administrator of General Services can evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the disposal provisions of any other law to determine consistency with the authority conferred by Title 40. The provisions of this section do not apply to disposals of real property authorized to be made by 40 U.S.C. 113 or by any special statute that directs or requires an Executive agency named in the law to transfer or convey specifically described real property in accordance with the provisions of that statute.

        Credit Disposals

          § 102-75.295   What is the policy on extending credit in connection with the disposal of surplus property?

#### § § 102-75.295

          The disposal agency—

          (a) May extend credit in connection with any disposal of surplus property when it determines that credit terms are necessary to avoid reducing the salability of the property and potential obtainable price and, when below market rates are extended, confer with the Office of Management and Budget to determine if the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 is applicable to the transaction;

          (b) Must administer and manage the credit disposal and any related security;

          (c) May enforce, adjust, or settle any right of the Government with respect to extending credit in a manner and with terms that are in the best interests of the Government; and

          (d) Must include provisions in the conveyance documents that obligate the purchaser, where a sale is made upon credit, to obtain the disposal agency's prior written approval before reselling or leasing the property. The purchaser's credit obligations to the United States must be fulfilled before the disposal agency may approve the resale of the property.

        Designation of Disposal Agencies

          § 102-75.296   When may a landholding agency other than GSA be the disposal agency for real and related personal property?

#### § § 102-75.296

          A landholding agency may be the disposal agency for real and related personal property when—

          (a) The agency has statutory authority to dispose of real and related personal property;

          (b) The agency has delegated authority from GSA to dispose of real and related personal property; or

          (c) The agency is disposing of—

          (1) Leases, licenses, permits, easements, and other similar real estate interests held by agencies in non-Government-owned real property;

          (2) Government-owned improvements, including fixtures, structures, and other improvements of any kind as long as the underlying land is not being disposed; or

          (3) Standing timber, embedded gravel, sand, stone, and underground water, without the underlying land.

          § 102-75.297   Are there any exceptions to when landholding agencies can serve as the disposal agency?

#### § § 102-75.297

          Yes, landholding agencies may not serve as the disposal agency when—

          (a) Either the landholding agency or GSA determines that the Government's best interests are served by disposing of leases, licenses, permits, easements and similar real estate interests together with other property owned or controlled by the Government that has been or will be reported to GSA, or

          (b) Government-owned machinery and equipment being used by a contractor-operator will be sold to a contractor-operator.

          § 102-75.298   Can agencies request that GSA be the disposal agency for real property and real property interests described in § 102-75.296?

#### § § 102-75.298

          Yes. If requested, GSA, at its discretion, may be the disposal agency for such real property and real property interests.

          § 102-75.299   What are landholding agencies' responsibilities if GSA conducts the disposal?

#### § § 102-75.299

          Landholding agencies are and remain responsible for all rental/lease payments until the lease expires or is terminated. Landholding agencies are responsible for paying any restoration or other direct costs incurred by the Government associated with termination of a lease, and for paying any demolition and removal costs not offset by the sale of the property. (See also § 102-75.965.)

        Appraisal

          § 102-75.300   Are appraisals required for all real property disposal transactions?

#### § § 102-75.300

          Generally, yes, appraisals are required for all real property disposal transactions, except when—

          (a) An appraisal will serve no useful purpose (e.g., legislation authorizes conveyance without monetary consideration or at a fixed price). This exception does not apply to negotiated sales to public agencies intending to use the property for a public purpose not covered by any of the special disposal provisions in subpart C of this part; or

          (b) The estimated fair market value of property to be offered on a competitive sale basis does not exceed $300,000.

          § 102-75.305   What type of appraisal value must be obtained for real property disposal transactions?

#### § § 102-75.305

          For all real property transactions requiring appraisals, agencies must obtain, as appropriate, an appraisal of either the fair market value or the fair annual rental value of the property available for disposal.

          § 102-75.310   Who must agencies use to appraise the real property?

#### § § 102-75.310

          Agencies must use only experienced and qualified real estate appraisers familiar with the types of property to be appraised when conducting the appraisal. When an appraisal is required for negotiation purposes, the same standard applies. However, agencies may authorize other methods of obtaining an estimate of the fair market value or the fair annual rental when the cost of obtaining that data from a contract appraiser would be out of proportion to the expected recoverable value of the property.

          § 102-75.315   Are appraisers authorized to consider the effect of historic covenants on the fair market value?

#### § § 102-75.315

          Yes, appraisers are authorized to consider the effect of historic covenants on the fair market value, if the property is in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

          § 102-75.320   Does appraisal information need to be kept confidential?

#### § § 102-75.320

          Yes, appraisals, appraisal reports, appraisal analyses, and other pre-decisional appraisal documents are confidential and can only be used by authorized Government personnel who can substantiate the need to know this information. Appraisal information must not be divulged prior to the delivery and acceptance of the deed. Any persons engaged to collect or evaluate appraisal information must certify that—

          (a) They have no direct or indirect interest in the property; and

          (b) The report was prepared and submitted without bias or influence.

        Inspection

          § 102-75.325   What responsibility does the landholding agency have to provide persons the opportunity to inspect available surplus property?

#### § § 102-75.325

          Landholding agencies should provide all persons interested in acquiring available surplus property with the opportunity to make a complete inspection of the property, including any available inventory records, plans, specifications, and engineering reports that relate to the property. These inspections are subject to any necessary national security restrictions and are subject to the disposal agency's rules. (See §§ 102-75.335 and 102-75.985.)

        Submission of Offers To Purchase or Lease

          § 102-75.330   What form must all offers to purchase or lease be in?

#### § § 102-75.330

          All offers to purchase or lease must be in writing, accompanied by any required earnest money deposit, using the form prescribed by the disposal agency. In addition to the financial terms upon which the offer is predicated, the offer must set forth the willingness of the offeror to abide by the terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions upon which the property is offered, and must contain such other information as the disposal agency may request.

        Provisions Relating to Asbestos

          § 102-75.335   Where asbestos is identified, what information must the disposal agency incorporate into the offer to purchase and the conveyance document?

#### § § 102-75.335

          Where the existence of asbestos on the property has been brought to the attention of the disposal agency by the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118) information provided (see § 102-75.125), the disposal agency must incorporate this information (less any cost or time estimates to remove the asbestos-containing materials) into any offer to purchase and conveyance document and include the following wording:

        Provisions Relating to Hazardous Substance Activity

          § 102-75.340   Where hazardous substance activity has been identified on property proposed for disposal, what information must the disposal agency incorporate into the offer to purchase and the conveyance document?

#### § § 102-75.340

          Where the existence of hazardous substance activity has been brought to the attention of the disposal agency by the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118) information provided (see §§ 102-75.125 and 102-75.130), the disposal agency must incorporate this information into any offer to purchase and conveyance document. In any offer to purchase and conveyance document, disposal agencies, generally, must also address the following (specific recommended language that addresses the following issues can be found in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal):

          (a) Notice of all hazardous substance activity identified as a result of a complete search of agency records by the landholding agency.

          (b) A statement, certified by a responsible landholding agency official in the Report of Excess Real Property, that all remedial actions necessary to protect human health and the environment with regard to such hazardous substance activity have been taken (this is not required in the offer to purchase or conveyance document in the case of a transfer of property under the authority of section 120(h)(3)(C) of CERCLA, or the Early Transfer Authority, or a conveyance to a “potentially responsible party”, as defined by CERCLA (see 102-75.345)).

          (c) A commitment, on behalf of the United States, to return to correct any hazardous condition discovered after the conveyance that results from hazardous substance activity prior to the date of conveyance.

          (d) A reservation by the United States of a right of access in order to accomplish any further remedial actions required in the future.

          § 102-75.345   What is different about the statements in the offer to purchase and conveyance document if the sale is to a potentially responsible party with respect to the hazardous substance activity?

#### § § 102-75.345

          In the case where the purchaser or grantee is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to hazardous substance activity on the property under consideration, the United States is no longer under a general obligation to certify that the property has been successfully remediated, or to commit to return to the property to address contamination that is discovered in the future. Therefore, the statements of responsibility and commitments on behalf of the United States referenced in § 102-75.340 should not be used. Instead, language should be included in the offer to purchase and conveyance document that is consistent with any agreement that has been reached between the landholding agency and the PRP with regard to prior hazardous substance activity.

        Public Benefit Conveyances

          § 102-75.350   What are disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning public benefit conveyances?

#### § § 102-75.350

          Based on a highest and best use analysis, disposal agencies may make surplus real property available to State and local governments and certain non-profit institutions or organizations at up to 100 percent public benefit discount for public benefit purposes. Some examples of such purposes are education, health, park and recreation, the homeless, historic monuments, public airports, highways, correctional facilities, ports, and wildlife conservation. The implementing regulations for these conveyances are found in this subpart.

          § 102-75.351   May the disposal agency waive screening for public benefit conveyances?

#### § § 102-75.351

          All properties, consistent with the highest and best use analysis, will normally be screened for public benefit uses. However, the disposal agency may waive public benefit screening, with the exception of the mandatory McKinney-Vento homeless screening, for specific property disposal considerations, e.g., when a property has been reported excess for exchange purposes.

          § 102-75.355   What clause must be in the offer to purchase and the conveyance documents for public benefit conveyances?

#### § § 102-75.355

          Executive agencies must include in the offer to purchase and conveyance documents the non-discrimination clause in § 102-75.360 for public benefit conveyances.

          § 102-75.360   What wording must be in the non-discrimination clause that is required in the offer to purchase and in the conveyance document?

#### § § 102-75.360

          The wording of the non-discrimination clause must be as follows:

        Power Transmission Lines

          § 102-75.365   Do disposal agencies have to notify State entities and Government agencies that a surplus power transmission line and right-of-way is available?

#### § § 102-75.365

          Yes, disposal agencies must notify State entities and Government agencies of the availability of a surplus power transmission line and right-of-way.

          § 102-75.370   May a State, or any political subdivision thereof, certify to a disposal agency that it needs a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way acquired for its construction to meet the requirements of a public or cooperative power project?

#### § § 102-75.370

          Yes, section 13(d) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(d)) allows any State or political subdivision, or any State or Government agency or instrumentality to certify to the disposal agency that a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way acquired for its construction is needed to meet the requirements of a public or cooperative power project.

          § 102-75.375   What happens once a State, or political subdivision, certifies that it needs a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way acquired for its construction to meet the requirements of a public or cooperative power project?

#### § § 102-75.375

          Generally, once a State or political subdivision certifies that it needs a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way, the disposal agency may sell the property to the state, or political subdivision thereof, at the fair market value. However, if a sale of a surplus transmission line cannot be accomplished because of the price to be charged, or other reasons, and the certification by the State or political subdivision is not withdrawn, the disposal agency must report the facts involved to the Administrator of General Services, to determine what further action will or should be taken to dispose of the property.

          § 102-75.380   May power transmission lines and rights-of-way be disposed of in other ways?

#### § § 102-75.380

          Yes, power transmission lines and rights-of-way not disposed of by sale for fair market value may be disposed of following other applicable provisions of this part, including, if appropriate, reclassification by the disposal agency.

        Property for Public Airports

          § 102-75.385   Do disposal agencies have the responsibility to notify eligible public agencies that airport property has been determined to be surplus?

#### § § 102-75.385

          Yes, the disposal agency must notify eligible public agencies that property currently used as or suitable for use as a public airport under the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, has been determined to be surplus. A copy of the landholding agency's Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118, with accompanying schedules) must be transmitted with the copy of the surplus property notice sent to the appropriate regional office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA must furnish an application form and instructions for the preparation of an application to eligible public agencies upon request.

          § 102-75.390   What does the term “surplus airport property” mean?

#### § § 102-75.390

          For the purposes of this part, surplus airport property is any surplus real property including improvements and personal property included as a part of the operating unit that the Administrator of FAA deems is—

          (a) Essential, suitable, or desirable for the development, improvement, operation, or maintenance of a public airport, as defined in the Federal Airport Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101); or

          (b) Reasonably necessary to fulfill the immediate and foreseeable future requirements of the grantee for the development, improvement, operation, or maintenance of a public airport, including property needed to develop sources of revenue from non-aviation businesses at a public airport. Approval for non-aviation revenue-producing areas may only be given for such areas as are anticipated to generate net proceeds that do not exceed expected deficits for operation of the aviation area applied for at the airport.

          § 102-75.395   May surplus airport property be conveyed or disposed of to a State, political subdivision, municipality, or tax-supported institution for a public airport?

#### § § 102-75.395

          Yes, section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (49 U.S.C. § 47151) authorizes the disposal agency to convey or dispose of surplus airport property to a State, political subdivision, municipality, or tax-supported institution for use as a public airport.

          § 102-75.400   Is industrial property located on an airport also considered to be “airport property”?

#### § § 102-75.400

          No, if the Administrator of General Services determines that a property's highest and best use is industrial, then the property must be classified as such for disposal without regard to the public benefit conveyance provisions of this subpart.

          § 102-75.405   What responsibilities does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have after receiving a copy of the notice (and a copy of the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)) given to eligible public agencies that there is surplus airport property?

#### § § 102-75.405

          As soon as possible after receiving the copy of the surplus notice, the FAA must inform the disposal agency of its determination. Then, the FAA must provide assistance to any eligible public agency known to have a need for the property for a public airport, so that the public agency may develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan of use and procurement for the property.

          § 102-75.410   What action must the disposal agency take after an eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use and application to acquire property for a public airport?

#### § § 102-75.410

          After an eligible public agency submits a plan of use and application, the disposal agency must transmit two copies of the plan and two copies of the application to the appropriate FAA regional office. The FAA must promptly submit a recommendation to the disposal agency for disposal of the property for a public airport or must inform the disposal agency that no such recommendation will be submitted.

          § 102-75.415   What happens after the disposal agency receives the FAA's recommendation for disposal of the property for a public airport?

#### § § 102-75.415

          The head of the disposal agency, or his or her designee, may convey property approved by the FAA for use as a public airport to the eligible public agency, subject to the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended.

          § 102-75.420   What happens if the FAA informs the disposal agency that it does not recommend disposal of the property for a public airport?

#### § § 102-75.420

          Any airport property that the FAA does not recommend for disposal as a public airport must be disposed of in accordance with other applicable provisions of this part. However, the disposal agency must first notify the landholding agency of its inability to dispose of the property for use as a public airport. In addition, the disposal agency must allow the landholding agency 30 days to withdraw the property from surplus or to waive any future interest in the property for public airport use.

#### § § 102-75.425

          The Administrator of the FAA has the sole responsibility for enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of disposals to be used as a public airport. The FAA is also responsible for reforming, correcting, or amending any disposal instruments; granting releases; and any action necessary for recapturing the property, using the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47101

          § 102-75.430   What happens if property conveyed for use as a public airport is revested in the United States?

#### § § 102-75.430

          If property that was conveyed for use as a public airport is revested in the United States for noncompliance with the terms of the disposal, or other cause, the Administrator of the FAA must be accountable for the property and must report the property to GSA as excess property following the provisions of this part.

          § 102-75.435   Does the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, as amended (Airport Act of 1970), apply to the transfer of airports to State and local agencies?

#### § § 102-75.435

          No, the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, as amended (49 U.S.C. 47101-47131) (Airport Act of 1970), does not apply to the transfer of airports to State and local agencies. The transfer of airports to State and local agencies may be made only under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (49 U.S.C. 47151-47153). Only property that the landholding agency determines cannot be reported excess to GSA for disposal under Title 40, but nevertheless may be made available for use by a State or local public body as a public airport without being inconsistent with the Federal program of the landholding agency, may be conveyed under the Airport Act of 1970. In the latter instance, the Airport Act of 1970 may be used to transfer non-excess land for airport development purposes provided it does not constitute an entire airport. An entire, existing and established airport can only be disposed of to a State or eligible local government under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944.

Any of these actions are subject to the approval of the head of the disposal agency. DOT must notify the head of the disposal agency of its intent to take any proposed action, identify the property affected, and describe in detail the proposed action, including the reasons for the proposed action.

          § 102-75.875   What happens in the case of repossession by the United States under a reversion of title for noncompliance with the terms or conditions of conveyance?

#### § § 102-75.875

          In each case of a repossession by the United States, DOT must, at or prior to reversion of title, provide the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office, with a Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118) and accompanying schedules. After receiving a statement from DOT that title to the property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement and determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in consultation with DOT, determines that the property should be revested, DOT must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review and act upon the Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the grantee must provide protection and maintenance for the property until the title reverts to the Federal Government, including the period following the notice of intent to revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.

          (b) Bid prices after advertising are unreasonable (for all or part of the property) or were not independently arrived at in open competition;

          (c) The character or condition of the property or unusual circumstances make it impractical to advertise for competitive bids and the fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtainable by negotiation;

          (d) The disposals will be to States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, possessions, political subdivisions, or tax-supported agencies therein, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtainable by negotiation. Negotiated sales to public bodies can only be conducted if a public benefit, which would not be realized from a competitive sale, will result from the negotiated sale; or

          (e) Negotiation is otherwise authorized by Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code or other law, such as disposals of power transmission lines for public or cooperative power projects.

          § 102-75.885   What are the disposal agency's responsibilities concerning negotiated sales?

#### § § 102-75.885

#### § § 102-75.890

          Disposal agencies must include in the offer to purchase and conveyance documents an excess profits clause, which usually runs for 3 years, to eliminate the potential for windfall profits to public agencies. This clause states that, if the purchaser should sell or enter into agreements to sell the property within 3 years from the date of title transfer by the Federal Government, all proceeds in excess of the purchaser's costs will be remitted to the Federal Government.

          § 102-75.895   What wording must generally be in the excess profits clause that is required in the offer to purchase and in the conveyance document?

#### § § 102-75.895

          The wording of the excess profits clause should generally be as follows:

          § 102-75.900   What is a negotiated sale for economic development purposes?

#### § § 102-75.900

          A negotiated sale for economic development purposes means that the public body purchasing the property will develop or make substantial improvements to the property with the intention of reselling or leasing the property in parcels to users to advance the community's economic benefit. This type of negotiated sale is acceptable where the expected public benefits to the community are greater than the anticipated proceeds derived from a competitive public sale.

          (c) Any real property disposed of by lease for a term of more than 5 years, if the total estimated rent over the term of the lease is in excess of $100,000.

          (d) Any real property or real and related personal property disposed of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property disposed in which any part of the consideration is real property.

          § 102-75.910   Are there any exceptions to this policy of preparing explanatory statements?

#### § § 102-75.910

          Yes, the disposal agency is not required to prepare an explanatory statement for property authorized to be disposed of without advertising by any provision of law other than 40 U.S.C. 545.

          § 102-75.915   Do disposal agencies need to retain a copy of the explanatory statement?

#### § § 102-75.915

          If there is no objection, the disposal agency may consummate the sale on or after 35 days from the date the Administrator of General Services transmitted the explanatory statement to the committees. If there is an objection, the disposal agency must resolve objections with the appropriate Congressional committee or subcommittee before consummating the sale.

        Public Sales

          § 102-75.935   What are disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning public sales?

#### § § 102-75.935

        Disposing of Easements

          § 102-75.936   When can an agency dispose of an easement?

#### § § 102-75.936

          When the use, occupancy or control of an easement is no longer needed, agencies may release the easement to the owner of the land subject to the easement (servient estate).

          § 102-75.937   Can an easement be released or disposed of at no cost?

#### § § 102-75.937

          Yes. However, agencies must consider the Government's cost of acquiring the easement and other factors when determining if the easement will be disposed of with or without monetary or other consideration. If the easement was acquired at substantial consideration, agencies must—

          (a) Determine the easement's fair market value (estimate the fair market value of the fee land without the easement and with the easement then compute the difference or compute the damage the easement caused to the fee land); and

          (b) Negotiate the highest obtainable price with the owner of the servient estate to release the easement.

          § 102-75.938   May the easement and the land that benefited from the easement (dominant estate) be disposed of separately?

#### § § 102-75.938

          Yes. If the easement is no longer needed in connection with the dominant estate, it may be disposed of separately to the owner of the servient estate. However, if the dominant estate is also surplus, the easement should be disposed of with the dominant estate.

#### § § 102-75.940

          Yes. Easements may be granted with or without monetary or other consideration, including any interest in real property.

          § 102-75.941   Does an agency retain responsibility for the easement?

#### § § 102-75.941

          Agencies may relinquish legislative jurisdiction as deemed necessary and desirable to the State where the real property containing the easement is located.

          § 102-75.942   What must agencies consider when granting easements?

#### § § 102-75.942

          Agencies must—

          (a) Determine the easement's fair market value; and

          (b) Determine the remaining property's reduced or enhanced value because of the easement.

          § 102-75.943   What happens if granting an easement will reduce the value of the property?

#### § § 102-75.943

          If the easement will reduce the property's value, agencies must grant the easement for the amount by which the property's fair market value is decreased unless the agency determines that the Government's best interests are served by granting the easement at either reduced or without monetary or other consideration.

        Non-Federal Interim Use of Surplus Property

          § 102-75.944   Can landholding agencies outlease surplus real property for non-Federal interim use?

          (a) The lease or permit does not exceed one year and is revocable with not more than a 30-day notice by the disposal agency;

          (b) The use and occupancy will not interfere with, delay, or impede the disposal of the property; and

          (c) The agency executing the agreement is responsible for the servicing of such property.

        § 102-75.250   What general policy must the disposal agency follow concerning the disposal of surplus property?

        § 102-75.255   What are disposal agencies' specific responsibilities concerning the disposal of surplus property?

#### § § 102-75.255

        The disposal agency must determine that there is no further Federal need or requirement for the excess real property and the property is surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. After reaching this determination, the disposal agency must expeditiously make the surplus property available for acquisition by State and local governmental units and non-profit institutions (see § 102-75.350) or for sale by public advertising, negotiation, or other disposal action. The disposal agency must consider the availability of real property for public purposes on a case-by-case basis, based on highest and best use and estimated fair market value. Where hazardous substance activity is identified, see §§ 102-75.340 and 102-75.345 for required information that the disposal agency must incorporate into the offer to purchase and conveyance document.

#### § § 102-75.260

        The disposal agency may dispose of surplus real property by exchange for privately owned property for property management considerations such as boundary realignment or for providing access. The disposal agency may also dispose of surplus real property by exchange for privately owned property where authorized by law, when the requesting Federal agency receives approval from the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate oversight committees, and where the transaction offers substantial economic or unique program advantages not otherwise obtainable by any other acquisition method.

        § 102-75.265   Are conveyance documents required to identify all agreements and representations concerning property restrictions and conditions?

#### § § 102-75.265

Extreme care must be exercised in the decontamination, management, and disposal of contaminated property in order to prevent such properties from becoming a hazard to the general public. The landholding agency must inform the disposal agency of any and all hazards involved relative to such property to protect the general public from hazards and to limit the Government's liability resulting from disposal or mishandling of hazardous materials.

        Improvements or Alterations

          § 102-75.960   May landholding agencies make improvements or alterations to excess or surplus property in those cases where disposal is otherwise not feasible?

#### § § 102-75.960

          Yes, landholding agencies may make improvements or alterations that involve rehabilitation, reconditioning, conversion, completion, additions, and replacements in excess or surplus structures, utilities, installations, and land improvements, in those cases where disposal cannot be accomplished without such improvements or alterations. However, agencies must not enter into commitments concerning improvements or alterations without GSA's prior approval.

#### § § 102-75.965

          The landholding agency remains responsible and accountable for excess and surplus real property, including related personal property, and must perform the protection and maintenance of such property pending transfer to another Federal agency or disposal. Guidelines for protection and maintenance of excess and surplus real property are in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.

#### § § 102-75.975

          If the property is not transferred to a Federal agency or disposed of during the 15-month period mentioned in § 102-75.970, then the disposal agency must pay or reimburse the landholding agency for protection and maintenance expenses incurred from the expiration date of said time period to final disposal, unless—

          (a) There is no written agreement between the landholding agency and the disposal agency specifying the maximum amount of protection and maintenance expenses for which the disposal agency is responsible;

          (b) The disposal agency's appropriation, as authorized by Congress, does not contain a provision to allow for payment and/or reimbursement of protection and maintenance expenses; or

          (c) The delay is caused by an Executive agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement specified in § 102-75.205. In this latter case, the requesting agency becomes responsible for protection and maintenance expenses incurred because of the delay.

          § 102-75.980   Who is responsible for protection and maintenance expenses if there is no written agreement or no Congressional appropriation to the disposal agency?

#### § § 102-75.980

        (b) Place excess and surplus real property in productive use through interim utilization, provided, that such temporary use and occupancy do not interfere with, delay, or impede its transfer to a Federal agency or disposal; and

        (c) Render safe or destroy aspects of excess and surplus real property that are dangerous to the public health or safety.

      Subpart E—Abandonment, Destruction, or Donation to Public Bodies

#### § § 102-75.1025

          A Federal agency may not abandon or destroy improvements on land or related personal property unless a duly authorized official of that agency finds, in writing, that donating the property is not feasible. This written finding is in addition to the determination prescribed in §§ 102-75.1000, 102-75.1005, and 102-75.1010. If donating the property becomes feasible at any time prior to actually abandoning or destroying the property, the Federal agency must donate it.

#### § § 102-75.1155

        Collecting the Information

          § 102-75.1162   How will information be collected?

#### § § 102-75.1162

          (a)  On a quarterly basis, HUD will canvass each landholding agency to collect information about property described as unutilized, underutilized, excess or surplus in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 524; however, HUD will accept property information between canvasses. Each canvass will collect information on properties not previously reported, and about property reported previously where the status or classification of the property has changed, or improvements have been made to the property. HUD will request descriptive information on properties sufficient to make a reasonable determination, under the criteria described in this section, of the suitability of a property for use to assist the homeless. Landholding agencies must report property information to HUD using the property checklist developed by HUD for that purpose. Property checklists submitted in response to a canvass must be submitted to HUD within 25 days of receipt of the canvass.

          (b)  By December 31 of each year, each landholding agency must notify HUD of the current availability status and classification of each property controlled by the agency that:

          (1) Was included in a list of suitable properties published that year by HUD; and

          (2) Remains available for application for use to assist the homeless or has become available for application during that year.

          (c)  HUD will collect information, in the same manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section, from GSA regarding property that is in GSA's current inventory of excess or surplus property.

          (d)  If the information provided on the property checklist changes subsequent to HUD's determination of suitability, including any improvements or other alterations to the physical condition of the land or the buildings on the property, and the property remains unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus, the landholding agency must submit a revised property checklist in response to the next quarterly canvass. HUD will review for suitability and, if it differs from the previous determination, repost the property information on the HUD website. For example, property determined unsuitable due to extensive deterioration may have had improvements, or property determined suitable may subsequently be found to be extensively deteriorated.

        Suitability Determination

          § 102-75.1163   Who issues the suitability determination?

#### § § 102-75.1163

          (a)  Within 30 days after the receipt of a completed property checklist from landholding agencies either in response to a quarterly canvass, or between canvasses, HUD will determine, using the criteria set forth in 24 CFR 581.6 whether a property is suitable for use to assist the homeless and report its determination to the landholding agency. Properties that are under lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six months prior to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or underutilized.

          (b)  HUD will determine the suitability of a property for use to assist the homeless without regard to any particular use.

          (c)  HUD will evaluate the environmental information contained in property checklists forwarded to HUD by the landholding agencies solely for the purpose of determining suitability of properties under the criteria in § 102-75.1166.

          (d)  HUD will assign an identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD will maintain a public record of the following:

          (1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of property, and the reasons for that determination; and

          (2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant to the requirements of § 102-75.1166(a).

          (e)  Property that is reviewed by HUD under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days after publication of a notice of unsuitability on the HUD website.

          (f)  (1) To request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of the homeless must contact HUD, in writing, through the U.S. Mail, email, or the HUD website, or such other method as HUD may require, within 20 days of publication of the notice of unsuitability.

          (2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be made only by representatives of the homeless.

          (3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is based,  HUD has improperly applied the criteria or HUD has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the determination ( that property is in a floodplain but not in a floodway).

          (4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency or GSA that such a request has been made. The landholding agency or GSA shall have 20 days from receipt of the notice from HUD, or an extended period agreed to between HUD and the landholding agency or GSA, to provide any information pertinent to the review. The landholding agency or GSA must refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration regarding unsuitability. If the landholding agency or GSA fails to meet the deadline, HUD will move forward with the appeal review with the property information it already has and information submitted in the appeal request provided by the representative of the homeless.

          (i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of receipt of the landholding agency's or GSA's response, or, if the landholding agency or GSA failed to meet the deadline, within 30 days of such deadline, and will notify the representative of the homeless and the landholding agency or GSA in writing of its decision.

          (ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, HUD will request the landholding agency's or GSA's determination of availability pursuant to § 102-75.1166, upon receipt of which HUD will promptly publish the determination on the HUD website.

        Real Property Reported Excess to GSA

          § 102-75.1164   For the purposes of this subpart, what is the policy concerning real property reported excess to GSA?

#### § § 102-75.1164

          (a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also provide a copy of HUD's suitability determination, if any, including HUD's identification number for the property.

          (b) If a landholding agency reports an excess property to GSA that HUD has already determined to be suitable for use to assist the homeless, GSA will screen the property pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section and will advise HUD of the availability of the property for use by the homeless as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. In lieu of the preceding sentence, GSA may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section.

          (c) If a landholding agency reports an excess property to GSA that has not been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in classification, such as from unutilized or underutilized to excess or surplus.

          (d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of the suitability determination.

          (e) When GSA receives notification from HUD listing suitable excess properties, GSA will transmit a response to HUD within 45 days. GSA's response will include the following for each identified property:

          (1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for the property and, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or

          (2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the homeless.

          (f) When GSA submits a checklist to HUD in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the information regarding the availability of the property, as specified in paragraph (e)(1) and (2) of this section, may be included with the checklist if it is known at the time of submittal.

          (g) When a surplus property is determined as suitable, confirmed as available by GSA, and notice is published on the HUD website, GSA will concurrently notify HHS, State and local government units, and known homeless assistance providers that have expressed interest in the particular property, and other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable properties.

          (h) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local governmental units and eligible non-profit organizations to determine interest in the property in accordance with this part. (See §§ 102-75.1220, 102-75.255, and 102-75.350.)

          (i) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability and will protect and maintain any property that is reported excess to GSA as provided in § 102-75.965.

        Suitability Criteria

          § 102-75.1165   What are suitability criteria?

#### § § 102-75.1165

          (a) In general, properties will be determined suitable unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following conditions:

          (1)  Property located less than an acceptable separation distance (under the standards in 24 CFR part 51, subpart C, and the HUD Guidebook, “Siting of HUD-Assisted Projects Near Hazardous Facilities” or successor guidebook) from any stationary aboveground container or facility which stores, handles, or processes hazardous substances of an explosive or fire prone nature (excluding containers and facilities that are not hazards as defined in 24 CFR 51.201), unless HUD can determine during the review period based on information provided by the landholding agency that appropriate mitigating measures, as defined in 24 CFR 51.205, are already in place.

          (2)  Property located in a System Unit, as defined at 16 U.S.C. 3502(7), under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 3501 ).

          (3)  Property with a documented and extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal physical safety or health. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, significant contamination from hazardous substances, as defined by 42 U.S.C. 9601, periodic flooding, sinkholes, or landslides.

          (b) In the cases in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, properties will be determined unsuitable, unless the landholding agencies provide information to enable HUD to determine the property is suitable:

          (1)  Property that is inaccessible, meaning that the property is not accessible by road (including property on small offshore islands) or is landlocked ( can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no established right or means of entry).

          (2)  Property located in an area to which the general public is denied access in the interest of national security ( where a special pass or security clearance is a condition of entry to the property), unless there is an alternative method to gain access without compromising national security.

          (3)  Property located within a runway clear zone or a military airfield clear zone.

          (4)  Property located in a floodway, unless only an incidental portion of the property is in the floodway and that incidental portion does not affect the use of the remainder of the property to assist the homeless.

        Determination of Availability

          § 102-75.1166   What is the policy concerning determination of availability statements for suitable properties?

#### § § 102-75.1166

          Within 45 days after receipt of notification from HUD pursuant to § 102-75.1162(a) that a property has been determined to be suitable, each landholding agency or GSA must transmit to HUD a statement of one of the following:

          (a) In the case of unutilized or underutilized property—

          (1) An intention to declare the property excess;

          (2) An intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless; or

          (3) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be different from those listed as suitability criteria in § 102-75.1165.

          (b) In the case of excess property which has been reported to GSA—

          (1) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the property, and, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or

          (2) A statement that there is a further and compelling Federal need for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the homeless.

        Public Notice of Determination

          § 102-75.1167   What is the policy concerning making public the notice of determination?

#### § § 102-75.1167

          (a) No later than 15 days after the most recent 45-day period has elapsed for receiving responses from the landholding agencies or GSA regarding availability, HUD will post on the HUD website a list of all properties reviewed, including a description of the property, its address, and classification. The following designations will be made:

          (1) Properties that are suitable and available.

          (2) Properties that are suitable and unavailable.

          (3) Properties that are suitable and to be declared excess.

          (4) Properties that are unsuitable.

          (b) HUD will establish and maintain a toll-free number for the public to obtain specific information about properties in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c) No later than 15 days after the most recent 45-day period has elapsed for receiving responses from the landholding agencies or GSA regarding availability, HUD will transmit to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) a copy of the list of all properties in paragraph (a) of this section. The USICH will immediately distribute to all State and regional homeless coordinators area-relevant portions of the list. The USICH will encourage the State and regional homeless coordinators to disseminate this information widely.

          (d) No later than February 15 of each year, HUD will publish in the  a list of all properties in the agency annual suitable property reports, reported to HUD pursuant to § 102-75.1162(b).

          (e) HUD will publish an annual list of properties determined suitable, but which agencies reported unavailable including the reasons such properties are not available.

        General Policies of HHS

          § 102-75.1168   What are the general policies of HHS?

#### § § 102-75.1168

          (a) It is the policy of HHS to foster and assure maximum utilization of surplus property for homeless assistance purposes.

          (b) Transfers may be made only to eligible organizations.

          (c) Property will be requested for assignment only when HUD has made a final determination that the property is suitable for use to assist the homeless, GSA has determined it is available, and HHS has determined it is needed for homeless assistance purposes. The amount of real and related personal property to be transferred shall not exceed normal operating requirements of the applicant. Such property will not be requested for assignment unless it is needed at the time of application for homeless assistance purposes or will be so needed within the immediate or foreseeable future.

          (d) Transfers by deed will be made only after the applicant's financial plan is approved and the applicant provides certification that the proposed program is permissible under all applicable State and local zoning restrictions, building codes, and similar limitations.

          (e) In instances of noncompliance, transferees are provided an opportunity to cure the noncompliance pursuant to 45 CFR 12a.10.

        Expression of Interest Process

          § 102-75.1169   How may eligible organizations express interest in properties to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1169

          (a) Properties published by HUD as suitable and available, pursuant to § 102-75.1167, for application for use to assist the homeless shall not be available for any other purpose for a period of 30 days beginning on the date the list of properties is published on the HUD website. Any eligible organization interested in any underutilized, unutilized, excess, or surplus property for use to assist the homeless must send HHS a written expression of interest in that property within 30 days after the property has been published on the HUD website.

          (b) Although a property may be determined suitable by HUD, HUD's determination does not mean a property is necessarily fit for use for the purpose(s) stated in the application, nor does it guarantee subsequent conveyance or transfer of a property.

          (c) If a written expression of interest to apply for suitable property for use to assist the homeless is received by HHS within the 30-day holding period, such property may not be made available for any other purpose until the date HHS or the appropriate landholding agency has completed action on the application submitted pursuant to that expression of interest.

          (d)(1) The expression of interest should identify the specific property, briefly describe the proposed use, include the name of the organization, and indicate whether it is a public body or a private, non-profit organization. The expression of interest must be sent to HHS by email,  or by mail at the following address: Department of Health and Human Services, Program Manager, Federal Real Property Assistance Program, Real Estate Logistics and Operations, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

          (2) HHS will notify the landholding agency (for unutilized and underutilized properties) or GSA (for excess and surplus properties) when an expression of interest has been received for a certain property.

          (e) An expression of interest may be sent to and accepted by HHS any time after the 30-day holding period has expired only if the property remains available as determined by GSA or the landholding agency for application to assist the homeless. In such a case, an application submitted pursuant to this expression of interest may be approved for use by the homeless if:

          (1) There are no pending applications or written expressions of interest made under any law for use of the property for any purpose; and

          (2) In the case of excess or surplus property, GSA has not received a bona fide offer to purchase that property or advertised for the sale of the property by public auction.

        Application Process and Requirements

          § 102-75.1170   How may eligible organizations apply for the use of properties to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1170

          (a) Upon receipt of an expression of interest, HHS will send an application packet to the interested entity. The application packet requires the applicant to provide certain information, including the following—

          (1)  The applicant must state whether it is requesting acquisition of the property by lease, deed, or permit. A lease of one year, extendable at HHS's discretion, with the concurrence of GSA or the landholding agency, may be granted when the applicant's initial application is approved and the applicant's final application outlining the applicant's financial plan is found to be otherwise reasonable based on the criteria in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, but either a change in zoning is required or the financial plan proposes to utilize Low-Income Housing Tax Credits or other funding sources that typically take longer to process than other forms of financing. Applicants that initially apply for transfer by lease or permit and subsequently request transfer by deed will follow the same bifurcated application process, including deadlines, contained in 42 U.S.C. 11411. Should an applicant wish to transition from acquisition by lease to acquisition by deed, HHS will issue a letter of commitment to a lessee indicating that, provided its application meets all application criteria, including securing of all necessary financing that complies with Federal Government requirements, HHS will issue a deed.

          (2)  The applicant must document that it satisfies the definition of an  as specified in § 102-75.1160.

          (3)  The applicant must describe the listed property desired, including existing zoning. Applicants must certify that any modification(s) made to and use of the property will conform to all applicable building codes, and local use restrictions, or similar limitations. In accordance with GSA policy, determinations regarding parcelization are made prior to screening. Therefore, expressions of interest and applications for portions of listed properties will not be accepted.

          (4)  The applicant must fully describe the proposed program and plan of use, including implementation plans.

          (5)  The applicant must demonstrate that the property is needed for homeless assistance purposes at the time of application and how the program will address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The applicant must demonstrate that it has an immediate need and ability to utilize all of the property for which it is applying.

          (6)  The applicant must fully explain why the property is suitable and describe what, if any, modification(s) will be made to the property before the program becomes operational.

          (7)  If the applicant's initial application is approved, the applicant must set forth a reasonable plan to finance the approved program within 45 days of the initial approval. To be considered reasonable, the plan must, at a minimum:

          (i) Specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources of funding for the proposed program, including any property modifications;

          (ii) Be accompanied by supporting documentation which demonstrates that the proposed plan is likely to succeed;

          (iii) Demonstrate that the applicant is ready, willing, able, and authorized to assume care, custody, and maintenance of the property;

          (iv) Demonstrate that it has secured the necessary dedicated funds, or will obtain such funds, to carry out the approved proposed program and plan of use for the property, including administrative expenses incident to the transfer by deed, lease, or permit;

          (v) Not diminish the value of the Federal Government's interest in the property nor impair the Federal Government's ability to revert and immediately dispose of the property free of any and all liens, encumbrances, or anything else which renders the property unmarketable. Deed transfers will only be made after an applicant demonstrates its financial plan adequately protects the Federal Government's interest in the property; and

          (vi) Neither subject the Federal Government's interest in the property to foreclosure nor impose obligations ( extended use agreements) on the Federal Government.

          (8)  Each applicant under this part must certify in writing that it will comply with all requirements of Federal law and HHS policy, as amended, relating to non-discrimination, including the following: the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and, as applicable, Executive Order 11063 (Equal Opportunity in Housing) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Non-discrimination in Federally Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1 and 45 CFR part 80; section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 92; the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 146 and 44 CFR part 91; and the prohibitions against discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8 and 45 CFR part 84. The applicant must maintain the required records to demonstrate compliance with all applicable Federal laws and HHS policies related to non-discrimination.

          (9)  The applicant must certify that it will insure the property against loss, damage, or destruction to protect the residual financial interest of the United States. The United States shall be named as an additional insured. Applicants must provide proof of insurance annually or upon request. Failure to maintain sufficient insurance may result in adverse action, including reversion of the property, at the discretion of HHS. In the event of a covered loss, the transferee must hold all insurance proceeds in trust and obtain written concurrence from HHS before disbursing the funds. Applicants, and all affiliated parties utilizing the property, as approved by HHS, must indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless for all actions involving use of the property.

          (10)  Where applicable, the applicant must provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic preservation requirements.

          (11)  The applicant must provide sufficient information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the instructions provided with the application packet. HHS will assist applicants in obtaining any pertinent environmental information in the possession of HUD, GSA, or the landholding agency. However, the burden is on the applicant to submit sufficient documentation for analysis by HHS.

          (12)  The applicant must certify that it has notified the applicable unit of general local government responsible for sewer, water, police, and fire services, in writing, of its proposed program for the specific property and submit a copy of that written notification.

          (13)  An applicant requesting a deed must certify that it has consulted all State and local governmental entities that will have jurisdiction over the property and that the proposed use will comply with all applicable zoning and local use restrictions, including local building code requirements. An applicant that applies for a lease or permit is not required to comply with local zoning requirements, as long as the Federal Government retains ownership of the property. Deed transfers will only be made after the applicant has provided acceptable written proof that the proposed program is not in conflict with State or local zoning laws and restrictions, building codes, or similar limitations.

          (b)  Due to the short time frame imposed by statute for evaluating applications, HHS's evaluation will, generally, be limited to the information contained in the application. It is therefore incumbent on applicants to provide thorough and complete applications.

          (c)  An initial application must be received by HHS, at the email address in § 102-75.1169(d)(1) or other address indicated by HHS, within 75 days after an expression of interest is received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written request from the applicant, HHS may, in its discretion, grant extensions authorized by 42 U.S.C. 11411(e)(2)(A), provided that the appropriate landholding agency or GSA concurs with the extension.

          (d)  (1) Upon receipt of an initial application, HHS will review it for completeness, and, if incomplete and time permits, may, in its discretion, return it or ask the applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information prior to final evaluation of the initial application.

          (2) HHS will evaluate each initial application within 10 days of receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. All initial applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements:

          (i)  The extent and range of proposed services, such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.

          (ii)  The demand for the program, the program's ability to satisfy unmet needs of the community, and the degree to which the available property will be fully utilized.

          (iii)  Demonstrated ability to provide the services, such as prior success in operating similar programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, and local authorities.

          (e)  (1) If HHS approves an initial application, HHS will notify the applicant and provide the applicant 45 days in which to provide a final application. The final application shall set forth a reasonable plan to finance, as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the approved program as set forth in the initial application. Applicants may not modify the approved initial application within its final application proposal.

          (2) Upon receipt of the final application, HHS will make a determination within 15 days and notify the applicant.

          (3) Unlike with initial applications, requests for extensions are not authorized by 42 U.S.C. 11411 and thus will not be considered for final applications.

          (4) Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis. HHS will notify all organizations that have submitted expressions of interest for a particular property whether an earlier application received for that property has been approved.

          (f)  If HHS receives more than one final application simultaneously, HHS will evaluate all applications and make a determination based on each application's merit. HHS will rank approved applications based on the elements listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the approved applicant.

        Action on Approved Applications

          § 102-75.1171   What action must be taken on approved applications?

#### § § 102-75.1171

          (a)  (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and forward a copy of the application to the landholding agency. The landholding agency will execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation with the applicant.

          (2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the following:

          (i) The length of time the property will be available.

          (ii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document (except that a landholding agency may not charge any fees or impose any costs).

          (b)  (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign the property to HHS for transfer. Requests to GSA for the assignment of surplus property to HHS for homeless assistance purposes will be based on the following conditions:

          (i) HHS has a fully approved application for the property;

          (ii) The applicant is able, willing, and authorized to assume immediate care, custody, and maintenance of the property;

          (iii) The applicant is able, willing and authorized to pay the administrative expenses incident to the transfer; and

          (iv) The applicant has secured the necessary funds, or had demonstrated the ability to obtain such funds, to carry out the approved program of use of the property.

          (2) Upon receipt of an acceptable assignment, HHS will execute the transfer document in accordance with the procedures and requirements set out in this subpart and any other terms and conditions HHS and GSA determines are appropriate or necessary. Custody and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term with the landholding agency ( the agency which initially reported the property as excess) and throughout the deed term with the transferee.

          (3) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses and other important national needs in deciding the disposition of surplus property. Priority of consideration will normally be given to uses to assist the homeless. However, both GSA and HHS may consider any competing request for the property made under 40 U.S.C. 550 that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless.

          (4) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over a request for property for homeless assistance, the agency making the decision will transmit to the appropriate committees of Congress an explanatory statement which details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.

        Surplus Property Transfer Documents

          § 102-75.1172   What documents are used for the transfer of surplus property for use to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1172

          (a) Surplus property may be conveyed to eligible organizations pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 550(d) and 42 U.S.C. 11411, as amended, by lease or deed, at the applicant's discretion.

          (b) Transfers of surplus property for homeless assistance purposes are in exchange for the transferee's agreement to fully utilize the property for homeless assistance purposes in accordance with the terms specified in the transfer document.

          (c) A transfer of surplus property for homeless assistance purposes is subject to the disapproval of GSA within 30 days after notice is given to GSA of the proposed transfer.

          (d) Surplus property transferred pursuant to this subpart will be disposed on an “as is, where is” basis without warranty of any kind except as may be stated in the transfer document.

          (e) Unless excepted by GSA in its assignment, the disposal of property includes mineral rights associated with the surface estate.

          (f) Transfers of surplus property under this subpart will be made with the following general terms and conditions:

          (1) For the period provided in the transfer document, the transferee shall utilize all the surplus property it receives solely and continuously for the approved program and plan of use, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 11411 and this subpart, except that:

          (i) The transferee has 12 months from the date of transfer to place the surplus property into use, if HHS did not approve in writing, construction of new facilities or major renovation of the property when it approved the final application;

          (ii) The transferee has 48 months from the date of transfer to place the surplus property into use, if the transferee proposes construction of new facilities or major renovation of the property and HHS approves it in writing at the time it approves the final application;

          (iii) If the applicable time limitation is not met, the transferee shall either commence payments in cash to the Federal Government for each month thereafter during which the proposed use has not been implemented or take such other action as set forth at § 102-75.1176 as is deemed appropriate by HHS. Such monthly payments shall be computed on the basis of the current fair market value of the property, as conveyed, at the time of the first payment and dividing it by 360 months. At HHS's discretion, the payment may be waived if the transferee makes a sufficient showing of continued progress to place the property into use or if an unforeseeable event occurs which prevents the property from being put into use within the applicable timeframe; and

          (iv) HHS may permit use of surplus property at any time during the period of restriction by an entity other than the transferee in accordance with § 102-75.1177.

          (2) The transferee will not be permitted to encumber, or dispose of the property, or impair full utilization thereof, without the prior written authorization of HHS. In the event the property is encumbered, sold, or disposed of, or is used for any purposes other than those set forth in an approved plan without the written consent of HHS, all revenues or the reasonable value of other benefits received by the transferee directly or indirectly from such use, as determined by HHS, will be considered to have been received and held in trust by the transferee for the account of the United States and will be subject to the direction and control of HHS. The provisions of this paragraph (f)(2) shall not impair or affect the rights reserved to the United States in paragraph (f)(8) of this section, or the right of HHS to impose conditions to its consent.

          (3) The transferee will file with HHS such reports on its maintenance and use of the surplus property and any other reports or information deemed necessary by HHS.

          (4) The transferee shall pay all administrative costs incidental to the transfer, including but not limited to—transfer taxes; surveys; appraisals; title search; the transferee's legal fees; recordation expenses, etc. Transferee is solely responsible for such costs and may not seek reimbursement from the Federal Government for any reason.

          (5) The transferee shall protect, preserve, maintain, and repair the property to ensure that the property remains in as good a condition as when received.

          (6) The transferee shall protect the residual financial interest of the United States in the surplus property by insurance or such other means as HHS directs.

          (7) The transferee shall abide by all applicable Federal civil rights laws including those specified in the covenants and conditions contained in the transfer document, prohibiting the transferee from discriminating on the basis of, including but not limited to, race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability in the use of the property.

          (8) In the event of noncompliance with any conditions of the deed as determined by HHS, whether caused by the legal or other inability of the transferee, its successors and assigns, to perform any of the obligations of the transfer document, the Federal Government has an immediate right of reentry thereon, and to cause all right, title, and interest in and to the property to revert to the United States, and the transferee shall forfeit all right, title, and interest in and to the property. In such event, transferee shall execute a quitclaim deed and take all other actions necessary to return the property to the United States within ninety (90) days of a written request from the Federal Government, extended only at the discretion of the Federal Government. Transferee shall cooperate with the United States in the event of a reversion and agrees that the United States need not seek judicial intervention before exercising its right to revert, reenter, and reconvey the property.

          (9) In the event title is reverted to the United States for noncompliance or voluntarily reconveyed to the United States, the transferee shall, at the option of HHS, be required to: reimburse the United States for the decrease in value of the property not due to market conditions, reasonable wear and tear, acts of God, or approved alterations completed by the transferee to adapt the property to the homeless use for which the property was transferred; and reimburse the United States for any costs incurred in reverting title to or possession of the property, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

          (10) With respect to leased property, in the event of noncompliance with any of the conditions of the lease, as determined by HHS or the landholding agency, the right of occupancy and possession shall, at the option of HHS or the landholding agency, be terminated. In the event a leasehold is terminated by the United States for noncompliance or is voluntarily surrendered, the lessee shall be required, at the option of HHS, to reimburse the United States for the decrease in value of the property not due to market conditions, reasonable wear and tear, acts of God, or approved alterations completed by the lessee to adapt the property to the homeless use for which the property was leased. With respect to any termination of leasehold resulting from noncompliance, the United States, shall, in addition thereto, be reimbursed for such costs as may be incurred in recovering possession of the property, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

          (11) Any other term or condition that HHS and GSA determine appropriate or necessary.

          (12) With respect to surplus property transferred by deed, the terms and conditions including those in this paragraph (f), apply for a period of three hundred sixty (360) months of use in accordance with a program of use approved in writing by HHS. The three hundred sixty months (360) period may, in HHS's sole discretion, be extended or restarted in the event the property is not fully utilized or is retransferred to a successor entity. Expiration of the terms and conditions in this paragraph (f) does not release the transferee from continuing compliance, as appropriate, with any conditions that may run with the land,  environmental conditions and/or historic preservation covenants. Such conditions will continue to be the responsibility of the transferee and successors.

          (13) With respect to surplus property transferred by lease, the terms and conditions including those in this paragraph (f), extend for the entire initial lease and for any subsequent renewal periods, unless specifically excluded in writing by HHS.

          (g) Related personal property may be transferred or leased as a part of the realty and in accordance with real property procedures.

          (h) Transferees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the property during the time that they possess the property. Upon termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the United States, the transferee will be responsible for removing improvements made to the property if directed to by the United States and, in such event, will be responsible for restoration of the property or the costs associated with restoring the property. If improvements made by the transferee are not voluntarily removed by the transferee and the United States consents, they will become the property of the United States. If the United States does not consent, the transferee shall reimburse the United States for reasonable costs of removal. GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or title reverts.

          (i) Transferees, by obtaining the written consent of HHS, may abrogate the restrictions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section for all or any portion of the property in accordance with the provisions of § 102-75.1178.

        Unsuitable Properties

          § 102-75.1173   What action must be taken on properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance?

#### § § 102-75.1173

          The landholding agency or GSA will defer action to dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance for 20 days after the date that notice of a property is posted on the HUD website. HUD will inform landholding agencies or GSA if an appeal of an unsuitability determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to § 102-75.1163(f). HUD will advise the agency to refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.

        Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and Other Related Acts (Environmental Impact)

          § 102-75.1174   What are the requirements for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other related Acts (environmental impact) for the transfer of Federal real property for use to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1174

          (a) HHS, prior to making a final decision to convey or lease, or to amend, reform, or grant an approval or release with respect to a previous conveyance or lease of, surplus property for homeless purposes, will act in accordance with applicable provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Archeological Data Preservation Act, and other related acts. No lease to use surplus property shall allow the lessee to make, or cause to be made, any irreversible change in the conditions of said property, and no lease shall be employed for the purpose of delaying or avoiding compliance with the requirements of these Acts, unless approved by the United States.

          (b) Applicants shall be required to provide such information as HHS deems necessary to make an assessment of the impact of the proposed Federal action on the human environment. Materials contained in the applicant's official request, responses to a standard questionnaire prescribed by HHS, as well as other relevant information, will be used by HHS in making said assessment.

          (c) If the assessment reveals:

          (1) That the proposed Federal action involved properties of historical significance which are listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places; or

          (2) That a more than insignificant impact on the human environment is reasonably foreseeable as a result of the proposed action; or

          (3) That the proposed Federal action could result in irreparable loss or destruction of archeologically significant items or data, HHS will, except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, prepare and distribute, or cause to be prepared or distributed, such notices and statements and obtain such approvals as are required by the Acts cited in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (d) If a proposed action involves other Federal agencies in a sequence of actions, or a group of actions, directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence, HHS may enter into and support a lead agency agreement to designate a single lead agency which will assume primary responsibility for coordinating the assessment of environmental effects of proposed Federal actions, preparing and distributing such notices and statements, or obtaining such approvals, as are required by the Acts cited in paragraph (a) of this section. The procedures of the designated lead agency will be utilized in conducting the environmental assessment. In the event of disagreement between HHS and another Federal agency, HHS will reserve the right to abrogate the lead agency agreement with the other Federal agency.

        No Applications Approved

          § 102-75.1175   What action must be taken if there is no expression of interest or approved application?

#### § § 102-75.1175

          (a) At the end of the 30-day holding period described in § 102-75.1169(a), HHS will notify GSA, or the landholding agency, as appropriate, if an expression of interest has been received for a certain property. Where there is no expression of interest, GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will proceed with disposal in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) Upon notice from HHS that all applications have been disapproved, or if no initial applications have been received within 75 days after an expression of interest, or no final application has been received within 45 days after an approved initial application, disposal may proceed in accordance with applicable law.

        Utilization and Enforcement

          § 102-75.1176   What are the utilization and enforcement requirements for property transferred for use to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1176

          (a)  For instances of noncompliance relating to surplus property transfers, HHS may impose, after providing an opportunity to cure to the transferee, any or all of the following sanctions in its sole discretion, as applicable:

          (1) Where property or any portion thereof was not used or is not being used for the purposes for which transferred, or is sold, leased or subleased, encumbered, disposed of, or used for purposes other than those in the approved program and plan of use, without the prior written consent of HHS, HHS may require the transferee to—

          (i) Place the property into immediate use for an approved purpose and extend the period of restriction in the transfer document for an additional term as determined by HHS;

          (ii) Hold in trust all revenues and the reasonable value of other benefits received by the transferee directly or indirectly from that use for the United States subject to the direction and control of HHS;

          (iii) Return title to such property to the United States or to relinquish any leasehold interest therein;

          (iv) Abrogate the conditions and restrictions of the transfer, as set forth in § 102-75.1178;

          (v) Make cash payments to the United States, as directed by HHS, equivalent to the current fair market rental value of the surplus property, as transferred, for each month during which the program and plan of use has not been implemented and continues to not be implemented; or

          (vi) Any other remedy that HHS determines appropriate or necessary.

          (2) Where the transferee desires to place the property into temporary use to assist the homeless other than that for which the property was transferred, written approval from HHS must be obtained, and will be conditioned upon HHS's authority to permit the use and such terms as HHS may impose.

          (3) If HHS or the landholding agency determines that a lessee or sublessee of a transferee is in noncompliance with a term or condition of the lease, or if the lessee voluntarily surrenders the premises, HHS may require termination of the lease and impose sanctions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as appropriate.

          (b)  When HHS recommends reversion of the property for noncompliance, HHS will seek GSA's concurrence. GSA will respond to HHS's concurrence request within 30 days of its receipt. If GSA concurs, GSA will work with HHS to complete the reversion of the property. If GSA does not concur to the reversion recommendation, GSA will issue, to HHS, a written determination: stating the reason(s) for the disapproval; and acknowledging that HHS has recommended reversion and, therefore, the property is no longer within HHS's Title V program. The Federal Government will implement a response to the noncompliance that is in its best interests.

        Other Uses

          § 102-75.1177   What are the requirements for other uses of a transferred property?

          (1) The transferee submits a written request to HHS explaining the purpose of and need for another eligible entity's use of the property, program plan, and other relevant information requested by HHS;

          (2) HHS determines that the proposed use would not substantially limit the program and plan of use by the transferee and that the use will not unduly burden the Federal Government;

          (3) HHS's written consent is obtained by the transferee in advance;

          (4) HHS approves the use instrument in advance and in writing;

          (5) The transferee agrees to lengthen the period of restrictions as determined by HHS; and

          (6) HHS advises GSA and there is no disapproval by GSA within thirty (30) days.

          (b) A transferee that does not follow paragraph (a) of this section will be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Title V program and subject to enforcement action, including reversion of the property.

        Abrogation

          § 102-75.1178   What are the conditions of abrogation for property transferred to assist the homeless?

#### § § 102-75.1178

          (a) HHS may abrogate the conditions and restrictions in the transfer document if:

          (1) The transferee submits to HHS a written request that HHS abrogate the conditions and restrictions in the transfer document as to all or any portion of the surplus property;

          (2) HHS determines the terms and conditions of the proposed abrogation and determines that the proposed abrogation is in the best interest of the United States; and

          (3) HHS transmits the abrogation request to GSA and there is no disapproval by GSA within 30 days after notice is given. If GSA disapproves, GSA will state, in writing, to HHS the reason(s) for the disapproval.

          (b) HHS abrogates the conditions and restrictions in the transfer document only upon receipt of the appropriate consideration, including cash payment, to the United States, as directed by HHS, which is based on the formula contained in the transfer document, and any other terms and conditions HHS deems appropriate to protect the interest of the United States.

        Compliance Inspections and Reports

          § 102-75.1179   What compliance inspections and reports are required?

#### § § 102-75.1179

          Transferees are required to allow HHS to conduct compliance inspections and to submit such compliance reports and actions as are deemed necessary by HHS. At a minimum, the transferee will be required to submit an annual utilization report regarding the operation and maintenance of the property, including current images of the entire property and such information as HHS shall require.

        No Right of Administrative Review for Agency Decisions

          § 102-75.1180   Is there a right of administrative review for agency decisions within HHS?

#### § § 102-75.1180

#### § § 102-75.1181

          The Secretary of HUD may waive any requirement of this subpart (over which the Secretary of HUD has jurisdiction) that is not required by law, whenever it is determined that undue hardship would result from applying the requirement, or where application of the requirement would adversely affect the purposes of the program. Each waiver will be in writing and will be supported by documentation of the pertinent facts and grounds. The Secretary periodically will publish notice of granted waivers on the HUD website.

        Severability

          § 102-75.1182   Are the provisions of this subpart severable?

#### § § 102-75.1182

          Any provision of this subpart held to be invalid or unenforceable with respect to certain parties or circumstances shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law unless such holding is that the provision of this subpart is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this subpart and shall not affect the remainder thereof.

        § 102-76.70   When are the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

#### § § 102-76.70

        For facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a), the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations when they exceed 20 percent of the costs of the alterations to the primary function area. If a series of small alterations are made to areas containing a primary function and the costs of any of the alterations considered individually would not result in providing an accessible path of travel to the altered areas, the total costs of the alterations made within the three year period after the initial alteration must be considered when determining whether the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered areas are disproportionate. Facilities for which new leases are entered into must comply with F202.6 of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard without regard to whether the costs of alterations to comply with F202.6 are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations.

        § 102-76.75   What costs are included in the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

#### § § 102-76.75

        For facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a), the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function include the costs associated with—

        (a) Providing an accessible route to connect the altered area and site arrival points, including but not limited to interior and exterior ramps, elevators and lifts, and curb ramps;

        (b) Making entrances serving the altered area accessible, including but not limited to widening doorways and installing accessible hardware;

        (c) Making restrooms serving the altered area accessible, including, but not limited to, enlarging toilet stalls, installing grab bars and accessible faucet controls, and insulating pipes under lavatories;

        (d) Making public telephones serving the altered area accessible, including, but not limited to, placing telephones at an accessible height, and installing amplification devices and TTYs;

        (e) Making drinking fountains serving the altered area accessible; and

        (f) Making parking spaces serving the altered area accessible.

        § 102-76.80   What is required if the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

#### § § 102-76.80

        For facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a), if the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations, the path of travel must be made accessible to the extent possible without exceeding 20 percent of the costs of the alterations to the primary function area. Priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the following order:

        (a) An accessible route and an accessible entrance;

        (b) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;

        (c) Accessible telephones;

        (d) Accessible drinking fountains; and

        (e) Accessible parking spaces.

        § 102-76.85   What is a primary function area for purposes of providing an accessible route in leased facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

#### § § 102-76.85

        For purposes of providing an accessible route in leased facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a), a primary function area is an area that contains a major activity for which the leased facility is intended. Primary function areas include areas where services are provided to customers or the public, and offices and other work areas in which the activities of the Federal agency using the leased facility are carried out.

        § 102-76.90   Who has the authority to waive or modify the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

#### § § 102-76.90

        The Administrator of General Services has the authority to waive or modify the standards in § 102-76.65(a) on a case-by-case basis if the agency head or GSA department head submits a request for waiver or modification and the Administrator determines that the waiver or modification is clearly necessary.

        § 102-76.95   What recordkeeping responsibilities do Federal agencies have?

#### § § 102-76.95

        (a) The head of each Federal agency must ensure that documentation is maintained on each contract, grant or loan for the design, construction or alteration of a facility and on each lease for a facility subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a) containing one of the following statements:

        (1) The standards have been or will be incorporated in the design, the construction or the alteration.

        (2) The grant or loan has been or will be made subject to a requirement that the standards will be incorporated in the design, the construction or the alteration.

        (3) The leased facility meets the standards, or has been or will be altered to meet the standards.

        (4) The standards have been waived or modified by the Administrator of General Services, and a copy of the waiver or modification is included with the statement.

        (b) If a determination is made that a facility is not subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a) because the Architectural Barriers Act does not apply to the facility, the head of the Federal agency must ensure that documentation is maintained to justify the determination.

Unless a differing rate has been approved by the Administrator, such fees or charges must approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services (i.e., market rates). The proceeds from such charges or fees must be credited to the appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the space or services. Any amounts in excess of actual operating and maintenance costs must be credited to miscellaneous receipts unless otherwise provided by law. The charges or fees assessed by the Administrator for the placement of antennas and supporting services in GSA-controlled space are generally credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.

          § 102-79.75   May Executive agencies assess fees for antenna placements against public service organizations for antenna site outleases on major pedestrian access levels, courtyards, and rooftops of public buildings?

#### § § 102-79.75

Executive agencies in GSA-controlled space, upon approval from GSA, may assess fees for antenna placements against public service organizations under 40 U.S.C. 581(h) and 40 U.S.C. 121(e). Such fees or rental rates must be equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for comparable space devoted to commercial antenna placements in the vicinity of the public building and the proceeds from such charges or fees must be credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.

          § 102-79.80   May Executive agencies assess fees for antenna placements against telecommunication service providers for antenna site outleases on major pedestrian access levels, courtyards, and rooftops of public buildings?

#### § § 102-79.80

          Yes. GSA, or other Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may charge fees based on market value to telecommunication service providers for antenna placements in public buildings. Market value should be equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for comparable space for commercial antenna placements in the vicinity of the public building. Such fees must be credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.

          § 102-79.85   What policy must Executive agencies follow concerning the placement of commercial antennas on Federal property?

#### § § 102-79.85

          Executive agencies will make antenna sites available on a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. Collocation of antennas should be encouraged where there are multiple antenna siting requests for the same location. In cases where this is not feasible and space availability precludes accommodating all antenna siting applicants, competitive procedures may be used. This should be done in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns. In making antenna sites available, agencies must avoid electromagnetic intermodulations and interferences. To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.

          § 102-79.90   What criteria must Executive agencies consider when evaluating antenna siting requests?

#### § § 102-79.90

          When evaluating antenna siting requests, Executive agencies must consider issues such as—

          (a) Public health and safety with respect to the antenna installation and maintenance;

          (b) Aesthetics;

          (c) Effects on historic districts, sites, buildings, monuments, structures, or other objects pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and implementing regulations;

          (d) Protection of natural and cultural resources (e.g., National Parks and Wilderness areas, National Wildlife Refuge systems);

          (e) Compliance with the appropriate level of review and documentation as necessary under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and implementing regulations of each Federal department and agency responsible for the antenna siting project, and the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies;

          (f) Compliance with the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) guidelines for radiofrequency exposure, ET Docket No. 93-62, entitled “Guidelines for Evaluating the Environmental Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation,” issued August 1, 1996, and any other order on reconsideration relating to radiofrequency guidelines and their enforcement.

To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the National Capital Planning Commission should be consulted for siting requests within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

          § 102-79.95   Who is responsible for the costs associated with providing access to antenna sites?

#### § § 102-79.95

          The telecommunications service provider is responsible for any reasonable costs to Federal agencies associated with providing access to antenna sites, including obtaining appropriate clearance of provider personnel for access to buildings or land deemed to be security sensitive as is done with service contractor personnel. OMB Circular A-25, entitled “User Charges,” revised July 8, 1993, provides guidelines that agencies should use to assess fees for Government services and for the sale or use of Government property or resources. For antenna sites on non-GSA property, see also the Department of Commerce Report on “Improving Rights-of-Way Management Across Federal Lands: A Roadmap for Greater Broadband Deployment” (April 2004) beginning at page 26. Under 40 U.S.C. 1314, GSA is covered in granting easements and permits to support the installation of antennas and cabling across raw land in support of constructing new and improving existing telecommunication infrastructures provided that such installation does not negatively impact on the Government.

          § 102-79.100   What must Federal agencies do with antenna siting fees that they collect?

#### § § 102-79.100

          The account into which an antenna siting fee is to be deposited depends on the authority under which the antenna site is made available and the fee assessed. For GSA-controlled property outleased under 40 U.S.C. 581(h) or section 412 of Division H of public law 108-447, the fee is to be deposited into GSA's Federal Building Fund. For surplus property outleased under 40 U.S.C. 543, the fee is to be deposited in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter IV of Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code. For siting fees collected under other statutory authorities, the fees might be deposited into miscellaneous receipts, an account of the landholding agency, or as otherwise provided by law. Federal agencies should consult with their agency's legal advisors before depositing antenna proceed from sites on agency-controlled Federal property.

        Equivalent Level of Safety Analysis

          § 102-80.105   What information must be included in an equivalent level of safety analysis?

#### § § 102-80.105

          The equivalent level of life safety evaluation is to be performed by a qualified fire protection engineer. The analysis should include a narrative discussion of the features of the building structure, function, operational support systems and occupant activities that impact fire protection and life safety. Each analysis should describe potential reasonable worst case fire scenarios and their impact on the building occupants and structure. Specific issues that must be addressed include rate of fire growth, type and location of fuel items, space layout, building construction, openings and ventilation, suppression capability, detection time, occupant notification, occupant reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress.

          § 102-80.110   What must an equivalent level of safety analysis indicate?

#### § § 102-80.110

          To be acceptable, the analysis must indicate that the existing and/or proposed safety systems in the building provide a period of time equal to or greater than the amount of time available for escape in a similar building complying with the Fire Administration Authorization Act. In conducting these analyses, the capability, adequacy, and reliability of all building systems impacting fire growth, occupant knowledge of the fire, and time required to reach a safety area will have to be examined. In particular, the impact of sprinklers on the development of hazardous conditions in the area of interest will have to be assessed.

          § 102-80.115   Is there more than one option for establishing that an equivalent level of safety exists?

#### § § 102-80.115

          Yes, the following are three options for establishing that an equivalent level of safety exists:

          (a) In the first option, the margin of safety provided by various alternatives is compared to that obtained for a code complying building with complete sprinkler protection. The margin of safety is the difference between the available safe egress time and the required safe egress time. Available safe egress time is the time available for evacuation of occupants to an area of safety prior to the onset of untenable conditions in occupied areas or the egress pathways. The required safe egress time is the time required by occupants to move from their positions at the start of the fire to areas of safety. Available safe egress times would be developed based on analysis of a number of assumed reasonable worst case fire scenarios including assessment of a code complying fully sprinklered building. Additional analysis would be used to determine the expected required safe egress times for the various scenarios. If the margin of safety plus an appropriate safety factor is greater for an alternative than for the fully sprinklered building, then the alternative should provide an equivalent level of safety.

          (b) A second alternative is applicable for typical office and residential scenarios. In these situations, complete sprinkler protection can be expected to prevent flashover in the room of fire origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (950 Btu/sec), and prevent flames from leaving the room of origin. The times required for each of these conditions to occur in the area of interest must be determined. The shortest of these three times would become the time available for escape. The difference between the minimum time available for escape and the time required for evacuation of building occupants would be the target margin of safety. Various alternative protection strategies would have to be evaluated to determine their impact on the times at which hazardous conditions developed in the spaces of interest and the times required for egress. If a combination of fire protection systems provides a margin of safety equal to or greater than the target margin of safety, then the combination could be judged to provide an equivalent level of safety.

          (c) As a third option, other technical analysis procedures, as approved by the responsible agency head, can be used to show equivalency.

          § 102-80.120   What analytical and empirical tools should be used to support the life safety equivalency evaluation?

#### § § 102-80.120

          Analytical and empirical tools, including fire models and grading schedules such as the Fire Safety Evaluation System (Alternative Approaches to Life Safety, NEPA 101A) should be used to support the life safety equivalency evaluation. If fire modeling is used as part of an analysis, an assessment of the predictive capabilities of the fire models must be included. This assessment should be conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Fire Models (ASTM E 1355).

          § 102-80.125   Who has the responsibility for determining the acceptability of each equivalent level of safety analysis?

#### § § 102-80.125

          The head of the agency responsible for physical improvements in the facility or providing Federal assistance or a designated representative will determine the acceptability of each equivalent level of safety analysis. The determination of acceptability must include a review of the fire protection engineer's qualifications, the appropriateness of the fire scenarios for the facility, and the reasonableness of the assumed maximum probable loss. Agencies should maintain a record of each accepted equivalent level of safety analysis and provide copies to fire departments or other local authorities for use in developing pre-fire plans.

          § 102-80.130   Who must perform the equivalent level of safety analysis?

#### § § 102-80.130

          A qualified fire protection engineer must perform the equivalent level of safety analysis.

          § 102-80.135   Who is a qualified fire protection engineer?

#### § § 102-80.135

          A qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the principles of physics and chemistry governing fire growth, spread, and suppression, meeting one of the following criteria:

          (a) An engineer having an undergraduate or graduate degree from a college or university offering a course of study in fire protection or fire safety engineering, plus a minimum of 4 years work experience in fire protection engineering.

          (b) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered in Fire Protection Engineering.

          (c) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered in a related engineering discipline and holding Member grade status in the International Society of Fire Protection Engineers.

        Room of Origin

          § 102-80.140   What is meant by “room of origin”?

#### § § 102-80.140

          Room of origin means an area of a building where a fire can be expected to start. Typically, the size of the area will be determined by the walls, floor, and ceiling surrounding the space. However, this could lead to unacceptably large areas in the case of open plan office space or similar arrangements. Therefore, the maximum allowable fire area should be limited to 200 m2 (2000 ft2), including intervening spaces. In the case of residential units, an entire apartment occupied by one tenant could be considered as the room of origin to the extent it did not exceed the 200 m2 (2000 ft2) limitation.

        Flashover

          § 102-80.145   What is meant by “flashover”?

#### § § 102-80.145

          Flashover means fire conditions in a confined area where the upper gas layer temperature reaches 600 °C (1100 °F) and the heat flux at floor level exceeds 20 kW/m2 (1.8 Btu/ft2/sec).

        Reasonable Worst Case Fire Scenario

          § 102-80.150   What is meant by “reasonable worst case fire scenario”?

#### § § 102-80.150

          Reasonable worst case fire scenario means a combination of an ignition source, fuel items, and a building location likely to produce a fire that would have a significant adverse impact on the building and its occupants. The development of reasonable worst case scenarios must include consideration of types and forms of fuels present (e.g., furniture, trash, paper, chemicals), potential fire ignition locations (e.g., bedroom, office, closet, corridor), occupant capabilities (e.g., awake, intoxicated, mentally or physically impaired), numbers of occupants, detection and suppression system adequacy and reliability, and fire department capabilities. A quantitative analysis of the probability of occurrence of each scenario and combination of events will be necessary.

        § 102-80.80   With what general accident and fire prevention policy must Federal agencies comply?

#### § § 102-80.80

        Federal agencies must—

        (a) Comply with the occupational safety and health standards established in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-596); Executive Order 12196; 29 CFR part 1960; and applicable safety and environmental management criteria identified in this part;

        (b) Not expose occupants and visitors to unnecessary risks;

        (c) Provide safeguards that minimize personal harm, property damage, and impairment of Governmental operations, and that allow emergency forces to accomplish their missions effectively;

        (d) Follow accepted fire prevention practices in operating and managing buildings;

        (e) To the maximum extent feasible, comply with one of the nationally recognized model building codes and with other nationally-recognized codes in their construction or alteration of each building in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 3312; and

        (f) Use the applicable national codes and standards as a guide for their building operations.

        § 102-81.20   Who must comply with this part?

#### § § 102-81.20

        Each agency occupying a Federal facility or Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA, including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services, for nonmilitary activities must comply with this part, except where the Director of National Intelligence determines that compliance would jeopardize intelligence sources and methods or the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance would conflict with the authorities of the Secretary of Energy over Restricted Data and Special Nuclear Material under, among others, sections 141, 145, 146, 147, and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Department of Energy Organization Act, or any other statute. In situations where a Federal facility is occupied by multiple Federal agencies for both military and nonmilitary activities, and each such occupancy is substantial, those occupants will coordinate on the physical security of the facility.

      Subpart B—Physical Security

        § 102-81.25   Who is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and upgrading physical security standards in each Federal facility and on Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA?

#### § § 102-81.25

        Each agency occupying a Federal facility or Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA, including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services, for nonmilitary activities is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and upgrading the physical security standards, except where the Director of National Intelligence determines that compliance would jeopardize intelligence sources and methods or the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance would conflict with the authorities of the Secretary of Energy over Restricted Data and Special Nuclear Material under, among others, sections 141, 145, 146, 147, and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Department of Energy Organization Act, or any other statute. An occupant agency, if it is the only Federal occupant agency in the building, or the Facility Security Committee (FSC), as applicable, uses the facility security assessment reports they receive from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—Federal Protective Service to inform deliberations regarding recommended countermeasures and other security-related actions. GSA will facilitate the implementation of the countermeasures or other actions after occupant agency or FSC approval, as applicable, and commitment of each occupant agency to pay its  share of the cost.

        § 102-81.30   Are there any special considerations for existing Federal facilities and Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA?

#### § § 102-81.30

        No, the RMP Standard applies to existing nonmilitary Federal facilities as part of the periodic risk assessment process. The security organization responsible for the Federal facility or Federal grounds will conduct a periodic risk assessment and recommend countermeasures and design features to be implemented at the Federal facility or on the Federal grounds. The FSC will determine whether the recommended countermeasures will be implemented or if risk will be accepted. The design and implementation of approved countermeasures at existing facilities must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders. For approved countermeasures that cannot be implemented immediately, a plan to phase in countermeasures and achieve compliance must be instituted and documented in accordance with the RMP Standard. In some cases, the implementation of countermeasures must be delayed until renovations or modernization programs occur.

        § 102-81.31   Are there any special considerations for leased facilities or new construction?

#### § § 102-81.31

        Yes. GSA will coordinate with the occupant agency and the security organization responsible for the Federal facility or Federal grounds when determining the applicable physical security clauses to use in the procurement package.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 102-83.05   What does this part cover?

#### § § 102-83.05

        This part covers GSA's considerations when making location decisions for Federal agencies in both Federally owned and leased space and the considerations of those Federal agencies operating under or subject to the real property authorities of the Administrator of General Services (Administrator), including those using delegated real property authority, when making their own location decisions. It directs practices that foster the policies and programs of the Federal Government and improve the management, efficiency, and effectiveness of Government activities.

        § 102-83.10   What are the governing authorities for this part?

#### § § 102-83.10

        The authorities for this regulation are as follows:

        (a) Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2204b-1), requires executive agencies to give first priority to locating in rural areas.

        (b) Federal Urban Land Use Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 901-905), requires GSA and other Federal agencies to consult and engage with the unit of general local government exercising zoning and land use jurisdiction. To the greatest extent possible, GSA must coordinate Federal projects with local planning agencies to be in accordance with zoning, land use practices and planning and development objectives.

        (c) Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 3301 ) (CICA), requires executive agencies to consider whether the delineated area will provide for adequate competition when acquiring leased space.

        (d) 40 U.S.C. 113(d) authorizes the Administrator to provide space to the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol upon their request.

        (e) 40 U.S.C. 121(c) authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations that the Administrator considers necessary to carry out the Administrator's functions under subtitle I of title 40 of the United States Code.

        (f) National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 54 U.S.C. 300101  encourages, among other things, the public and private preservation and utilization of all usable elements of the Nation's historic built environment.

        (g) 40 U.S.C. 584 authorizes the Administrator to assign and reassign space for an executive agency in any Federal Government-owned or leased building.

        (h) 40 U.S.C. 581(c)(1) authorizes the Administrator to acquire, by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, real estate and interests in real estate.

        (i) 40 U.S.C. 585 authorizes the Administrator to enter into a lease agreement for the accommodation of a federal agency in a building or improvement that is in existence or being erected by the lessor to accommodate the federal agency, and to assign and reassign the leased space to a federal agency.

        (j) Section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, 15 FR 3177, 64 Stat. 1270 (40 U.S.C. 301 note), which, with certain exceptions, transferred all function with respect to acquiring space in buildings by lease, and all functions with respect to assigning and reassigning space in buildings for use by agencies (including both space acquired by lease and space in Government-owned buildings) to the Administrator.

        (k) 28 U.S.C. 462(f) authorizes the Administrator to provide space to the judicial branch upon request from the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Court.

        (l) E.O. 12072 encourages Federal agencies to locate and use real estate in ways that serve to strengthen the Nation's cities and make them attractive places to live and work, conserve existing urban resources, and encourage the development and redevelopment of cities. Toward this end, the E.O. requires executive agencies to give first consideration to centralized community business areas and other areas recommended by local officials as possible locations for Federal facilities when locating in urban areas.

        (m) E.O. 13006 requires that, when operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the RDA and E.O. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies must give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies must consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies must then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists.

        § 102-83.15   Which Federal agencies must comply with these provisions?

#### § § 102-83.15

        All Federal agencies operating under or subject to the real property authorities of the Administrator, including those using delegated real property authority, must comply with these provisions. Refer to 41 CFR 102-71.20 for the definition of Federal agency. Federal agencies using independent authority must still comply with statutory requirements and E.O.s (consistent with such authority), but this part does not apply to these agencies. Agencies with independent authority may use these provisions at agency discretion.

        § 102-83.20   How does an agency request a deviation from the provisions of this part?

#### § § 102-83.20

        Refer to §§ 102-2.60 through 102-2.110 of this chapter for information on how to obtain a deviation from this part.

        § 102-83.25   Intentionally Omitted.

#### § § 102-83.25

      Subpart B—Location of Space

        § 102-83.30   What basic location of space policy governs a Federal agency?

#### § § 102-83.30

        (a) All Federal agencies when planning for location decisions under the authorities of the Administrator, including those using delegated real property authority, are required to apply the applicable laws, regulations, and E.O.s outlined in this part to their activities. This applies to agencies using the space and to agencies acquiring a leasehold interest or a new site to accommodate a space requirement.

        (b) Federal agencies intending to use space under this part are responsible for identifying the geographic area within which to locate their activities ( the delineated area) to support their mission and program requirements. Agencies must define delineated areas that support the applicable laws, regulations, and E.O.s outlined in this part. In addition to these responsibilities, agencies conducting a space acquisition have certain additional specific responsibilities as outlined in this part.

        § 102-83.35   Is there a general hierarchy of consideration that agencies must follow in their utilization of space?

#### § § 102-83.35

        Yes. In accordance with part 79, Assignment and Utilization of Space, Federal agencies must follow the hierarchy of consideration, giving first priority to Government-owned and Government-leased buildings. When no existing Government-owned or Government-leased space meets the space need, Federal agencies must follow the hierarchy of geographic consideration in § 102-83.95 when obtaining new space as identified in this subpart.

        § 102-83.40   What is a delineated area?

#### § § 102-83.40

        The delineated area is the specific geographic boundary within which space will be obtained to satisfy a Federal agency space requirement.

        § 102-83.45   What is a Core-Based Statistical Area?

#### § § 102-83.45

        A Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) is a geographic area established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Current CBSAs are listed in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, “Revised Delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and Guidance on Uses of the Delineations of These Areas,” dated March 6, 2020, or succeeding OMB Bulletin. In this part, the CBSA designation is used to distinguish between urban and rural areas, which have different directives associated with them.

        § 102-83.50   How is a CBSA defined?

#### § § 102-83.50

        A CBSA is defined by OMB using U.S. Census data as an area that has at its core an urban center and includes the adjacent areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting patterns pursuant to the  as updated periodically and published in the  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1104(d) and 44 U.S.C. 3504.

        § 102-83.55   What is a rural area?

#### § § 102-83.55

        A rural area is any area that is not contained within the geographic boundaries of a CBSA.

        § 102-83.60   What is an urban area?

#### § § 102-83.60

        An urban area is any area contained within the geographic boundaries of a CBSA.

        § 102-83.65   What is a principal city?

#### § § 102-83.65

        (a) A principal city is an incorporated place or census designated place within a CBSA that meets certain employment and population-based criteria. Major metropolitan areas typically have several principal cities.

        (b) The principal city designation is established by OMB pursuant to the  as updated periodically and published in the  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1104(d) and 44 U.S.C. 3504(e). OMB regularly publishes an updated list of Principal Cities (OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, and succeeding). In this part, the principal city designation is used to help the Federal agency focus local consultation and engagement.

        § 102-83.70   What are centralized community business areas and centralized business districts?

#### § § 102-83.70

        A centralized community business area (CBA) or centralized business district, also commonly referred to as a central business district, is an area of concentration of commercial real estate and activity within a principal city, including other specific areas of similar character that may be recommended by local officials. The CBA may be part of a traditional downtown area or part of another area that local government officials have identified as supportive of their long-term economic development objectives. CBAs are designated by local governments and not by Federal agencies, so Federal agencies must consult and engage with local officials to understand the current boundaries of these areas. As described in E.O. 12072, these areas may include other specific areas that are recommended by local officials.

        § 102-83.75   What is environmental justice?

#### § § 102-83.75

        Environmental justice is the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people are fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects including risks and hazards, such as those related to climate change and cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens on communities with environmental justice concerns; and have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment. Advancing environmental justice further requires Federal agencies to provide opportunities for meaningful engagement of the public, including communities with environmental justice concerns who are potentially affected by Federal activities. When planning for location decisions, which is the federal activity for purposes of this rule, Federal agencies must be especially mindful of how proposed locations would impact communities with environmental justice concerns. As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, Federal agencies should seek to minimize negative and maximize positive impacts in these areas, using available data and meaningful engagement with local stakeholders to identify such communities, and identify, analyze, and address adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards of the Federal activity.

        § 102-83.80   What is equitable development?

#### § § 102-83.80

        Equitable development is a positive development approach that employs processes, policies, and programs that aim to meet the needs of all communities and community members, with a particular focus on underserved communities and populations. When seeking Federal locations, agencies should, to the extent consistent with applicable law, consider the needs of communities, including those communities that are underserved, through policies and actions that reduce disparities while fostering communities that are healthy and vibrant.

        § 102-83.85   In addition to Federal agency mission, security and program requirements, what other factors and principles must agencies consider when establishing a potential delineated area and planning for location decisions?

#### § § 102-83.85

        (a) In addition to agency mission, security and program requirements, Federal agencies also must give serious consideration to the impact a location decision will have on improving the social, economic, environmental, and cultural conditions of communities, including those that have been historically harmed by environmental injustice and inequality, as well as avoiding harm to such communities, while at the same time promoting efficient and cost-effective Government real estate management. These factors and principles derive from the relevant authorities in this part and include the following:

        (1) Cost to the Government, including both upfront real estate acquisition as well as long-term operating costs;

        (2) Opportunities to reduce the Federal real estate footprint and optimize agency space usage;

        (3) Ability to manage the local Federal real estate portfolio strategically to optimize effective operations over the long term; and

        (4) Consideration of the competition requirements under CICA, if applicable to the site location decision.

        (b) In addition to agency mission, security and program requirements, Federal agencies also must consider a series of factors meant to promote Federal investment that supports larger Federal program goals and local development objectives. These factors include the following:

        (1) Compatibility with State and local economic development objectives, such as local and regional comprehensive plans, housing and transportation plans, neighborhood scale plans and local plans covering sustainability and resilience goals. When planning for location decisions, agencies should align, where possible, with local and regional planning goals. Agencies should meaningfully engage with local officials and community members potentially impacted by a location decision and consider their recommendations in light of Federal mission needs and equitability and sustainability goals, including where affected populations have experienced historic and ongoing harms due to environmental injustice and inequality;

        (2) Promoting environmentally sustainable development, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased resilience to the impacts of climate change, and stewardship of regional natural resources;

        (3) Maximizing the use of existing resources by leveraging investment in existing infrastructure;

        (4) Prioritizing development of brownfields (properties, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant), greyfields (previously developed land that is underutilized) and infill development;

        (5) Locating facilities along transportation corridors to encourage the use of alternate modes of transportation, and seeking efficient locations that provide a variety of transportation options for employees and the public, especially walking, biking and public transit options, while maximizing use of existing infrastructure and minimizing employee and visitor travel by car;

        (6) Prioritizing central business districts, existing employment centers and rural town centers, and locating in areas that are accessible by public transit, where it exists, to a broad range of the workforce and population, such as those seeking services or needing to visit Federal space locations;

        (7) Avoiding development in floodplains or impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable;

        (8) Fostering protection of the natural environment by preserving ecosystems, including native ecosystems, avoiding development of green space, and promoting climate change adaptation planning;

        (9) Advancing environmental justice and equitable development; and

        (10) Advancing Federal and local historic preservation objectives and promoting the preservation of historic resources and other existing buildings.

        (c) The factors listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be considered when applying the hierarchy of geographic consideration in § 102-83.90. The optimal Federal location decision is the choice that meets Federal agency mission, security and program requirements and is cost effective, while leveraging Federal development in support of these other Federal programs policies and goals, as well as local development objectives.

        § 102-83.90   What hierarchy of geographic consideration must agencies apply to location decisions?

#### § § 102-83.90

        (a) Agencies must develop policies and procedures for applying the goals of this part in their business practices. These policies and procedures must include methods for applying the hierarchy outlined in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) When making new location decisions, agencies must give preference to geographic areas in the following order:

        (1) Agencies must give first priority to locating in a rural area in accordance with the Rural Development Act of 1972 (RDA). As with other elements of this part, acquiring agencies must develop their own policies and procedures for implementing the goals of the RDA. Agencies must consider the objectives outlined in § 102-83.85 and use these principles and factors to differentiate among potential locations. Agencies are encouraged to seek a location that best meets these factors or meet multiple factors. If an agency's mission cannot be accomplished in a rural area, the agency may locate in an urban area.

        (2) When an agency's mission requires location in an urban area, the agency must give priority to the CBA within a principal city of a CBSA or other areas as recommended by local officials. Agencies must consider the objectives outlined in § 102-83.85 and use these principles and factors to differentiate among potential locations. Agencies are encouraged to seek a location that best meets these factors or meets multiple factors.

        (3) If an agency mission cannot be met within a principal city, or where areas, such as existing employment centers, outside the principal city offer better opportunities to advance the objectives outlined in § 102-83.85, in accordance with their established policies and procedures, agencies may proceed to seek space in those areas.

        (4) Once an agency has set a delineated area in a rural or urban area, agencies must comply with the requirements for consideration of historic properties and districts set forth in § 102-78.60.

        § 102-83.95   How must agencies consult and engage with local officials and communities to comply with the consultation and engagement elements of part 102-83?

#### § § 102-83.95

        Agencies have wide latitude to develop their own internal policies for consulting and engaging in ways that are both effective and efficient based upon the intent of this part, the relevant development context and the agency's core business practices. Agencies must develop internal policies and procedures that guide consultation and engagement using different methods for actions of varying scale or scope. Location decisions to support fee simple acquisition and Federal construction in most cases will require direct consultation and engagement with local officials during the location evaluation process to meet the intent of this part. Conversely, for acquisition of existing space through a lease contract, agencies may develop internal procedures that apply the hierarchy outlined in this part such that no transaction-specific consultation or engagement with local officials would be required if the delineated area is within a recognized CBA or other area recommended by local officials. To expedite effective and efficient implementation of this part, where appropriate, agencies are encouraged to pursue consultation and engagement actively with local officials and communities, as appropriate, to discuss development goals well ahead of specific space actions.

        (a) Under multiple guiding authorities, acquiring agencies must consult and engage with local officials to apply the principles outlined in this part properly. Consultation and engagement and consideration of local input must occur in urban areas, and agencies are encouraged to perform similar consultation and engagement in rural areas, as appropriate.

        (b) Federal agencies should refer to their agency Tribal consultation policies and applicable legal requirements, and confer if needed with agency counsel, to determine whether consultation with Tribal governments, Alaska Native corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or other entities is required, such as if the Federal location decision may include or affect Tribal trust or reserved lands, and natural resources, and if so conduct such consultation.

        (c) Where communities are likely to face displacement risks associated with a Federal location decision, based on agency analysis of existing data and consultation and engagement with local officials, or where communities have been harmed historically by inequity, such as persistent poverty or underinvestment, or environmental injustice, agency engagement should occur not only with relevant regional and local officials but also with members of the affected communities.

        (d) Meaningful engagement with local stakeholders outside of government or those who have been historically left out of community and economic development planning requires agencies to identify and include community members in federal location planning activities early enough in the process for them to have insight into and for their input to be reflected in the decision making process. This includes opportunities for significant participation through modes that reduce known barriers to participation, such as plain language use, translation, transportation, digital and non-digital access, culture, time of day, and availability of childcare and other supportive services.

        § 102-83.100   What flexibility do Federal agencies have to implement part 102-83 in high cost areas?

#### § § 102-83.100

        Agencies have flexibility in considering the differing costs among principal cities within a single CBSA and in setting delineated areas to incorporate lower-cost markets.

        There may be some instances where the head of the responsible acquiring agency or the head of the agency's designee determines that cost and security issues take precedence over the hierarchy of consideration in this part. Federal agencies may deviate from the hierarchy only where doing so would represent significant cost savings or security advantages to the Government. In such cases, agencies must consult and engage with and consider the recommendations of local officials, review and affirm this determination, and document the file accordingly.

        In every instance, agencies must seek to meet the intent of the governing authorities described in § 102-83.10, and they must incorporate their applicable process into their internal policies and procedures.

        § 102-83.105   Are Federal agencies required to give preference to historic properties when acquiring leased space?

#### § § 102-83.105

        Yes. Federal agencies must give a price preference to historic properties when acquiring leased space. See § 102-73.30 of this chapter for additional guidance.

        § 102-83.110   Does GSA provide assistance to Federal agencies by consulting and engaging with local officials to establish recommended delineated areas?

#### § § 102-83.110

        Yes. GSA may, at its discretion, assist agencies by consulting and engaging with local officials to establish recommended delineated areas for use in Federal location decisions. These GSA-recommended delineated areas may be proactively developed independent of a specific space requirement. These recommended delineated areas will take into consideration the factors discussed in this part. The final delineated area used in the space acquisition may differ from these recommended areas, depending on the agency mission requirements, CICA and other factors relevant to a specific space action.

        § 102-83.115   Are Federal agencies required to consider whether the CBA or other areas recommended by local officials will provide for adequate competition when acquiring leased space?

#### § § 102-83.115

        Yes. In accordance with CICA, Federal agencies must consider whether restricting the delineated area for obtaining leased space to CBAs or other areas recommended by local officials will provide for adequate competition when acquiring space. If a Federal agency determines that the delineated area must be expanded beyond the preferred areas to provide adequate competition, the agency may expand the delineated area in consultation and engagement with local officials. Federal agencies must continue to include the preferred area in such expanded areas.

        § 102-83.120   What information and data must agencies provide to the Administrator of General Services, or other acquiring agency head, to comply with the provisions of this part?

#### § § 102-83.120

        Efficient and effective space management of Federally owned and leased facilities through the activities described in this part requires that Federal agencies cooperate with acquiring agencies and furnish any related data and information requested by the acquiring agencies, to the extent not prohibited by law. This includes information or data that allows for:

        (a) Selecting, acquiring, managing, and disposing of Federal space in a manner that will foster the policies and programs of the Federal Government and improve the management and administration of Government activities;

        (b) Issuing regulations, standards and criteria for the selection, acquisition and management of Federally owned and leased space;

        (c) Surveying space requirements, space utilization and daily occupancy data of executive agencies;

        (d) Meeting essential space requirements in a manner that is economically feasible and prudent; and

        (e) Making maximum use of existing Federally controlled facilities that, in the acquiring agency head's judgment, are adequate or economically adaptable to meeting the space needs of executive agencies.

        § 102-83.125   Who must approve the final delineated area?

#### § § 102-83.125

        The Federal agency conducting the space acquisition must approve the final delineated area for the site acquisition or action. The acquiring agency must confirm that the final delineated area complies with all applicable laws, regulations and E.O.s.

        § 102-83.130   When is written justification for a delineated area in urban areas required?

#### § § 102-83.130

        If the delineated area identified is outside the CBA in a principal city, or differs from a GSA-recommended delineated area that has been developed in accordance with the guiding authorities in this part, an agency must demonstrate, in writing, that preference has been given to the CBA of a principal city or GSA's recommended delineated area, and that the agency considered the environmental and socioeconomic factors in subpart B, Location of Space, of this part. The agency justification also must address, at a minimum, the efficient performance of the mission(s) and program(s) of the agency, the nature and function of the facility or facilities involved, and the convenience of the public being served.

        § 102-83.135   How will GSA negotiate changes to the final delineated area with requesting agencies?

#### § § 102-83.135

        For space acquisitions conducted by GSA, if, based on its review of a requesting agency's identified delineated area, GSA concludes that the requesting agency's identified delineated area should be modified, GSA will discuss its recommended changes with the requesting agency. If, after discussions, the requesting agency does not agree with GSA's delineated area recommendation, the requesting agency may appeal GSA's determination in accordance with § 102-83.140. If a requesting agency elects to ask for a review of GSA's delineated area recommendation, GSA will continue to work on the requirements development and other activities related to the requesting agency's space request. GSA will not issue a solicitation to satisfy an agency's space request until a final delineated area is determined through the appeal process.

        § 102-83.140   Where may Federal agencies appeal GSA decisions and recommendations concerning the delineated area?

#### § § 102-83.140

        Agencies may appeal decisions and recommendations, in writing, to the GSA Regional Commissioner of Public Buildings in the region where the space acquisition is to take place or to the GSA Regional Commissioner's designee. The written request for review must include all relevant facts and other considerations and must justify the alternative delineated area identified by the requesting agency with regard to the location requirements set forth in all applicable statutes, E.O.s and regulations. Once submitted to the Regional Commissioner or the Regional Commissioner's designee, the requesting agency's appeal will proceed according to the process established internally by GSA.

        § 102-83.145   Do these regulations apply in GSA's National Capital Region?

#### § § 102-83.145

        The presence of the Federal Government in the National Capital Region is such that the distribution of Federal facilities has been, and will continue to be, a major influence on the character and extent of development in the National Capital Region. In view of the special nature of the National Capital Region and the preponderance of Federal space contained therein, these regulations will be applied in the National Capital Region in conjunction with regional plans and will guide the development of strategic plans for the housing of Federal agencies within the National Capital Region.

      Subpart C—Severability

        § 102-83.150   What portions of this part are severable?

#### § § 102-83.150

        All provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. If any provision is stayed or determined to be invalid, it is GSA's intention that the remaining provisions will continue in effect.

      Subpart A—Pricing Policy—General

        § 102-85.5   By what authority is the pricing policy in this part prescribed?

#### § § 102-85.5

        (a) General authority is granted in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, Sec. 205(c) and 210(j), 63 Stat. 390 and 86 Stat. 219; (40 U.S.C. 486(c) and 40 U.S.C. 490(j), respectively).

        (b) This part implements the applicable provisions of Federal law, including, but not limited to, the:

        (19) Executive Order 13006 of May 21, 1996 (61 FR 26071).

        § 102-85.10   What is the scope of this part?

#### § § 102-85.10

        (a) This part describes GSA policy and principles for the assignment and occupancy of space under its control and the rights and obligations of GSA and the customer agencies that request or occupy such space pursuant to GSA Occupancy Agreements (OA).

        (b) Space managed by agencies under delegation of authority from GSA is subject to the provisions of this part.

        (c) This part is not applicable to:

        (1) Licenses, permits or leases with non-Federal entities under the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act (40 U.S.C. 490(a)(16-19)); or

        (2) The disposal of surplus lease space under section 210(h)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(h)(2)).

        § 102-85.15   What are the basic policies for charging Rent for space and services?

#### § § 102-85.15

        (a) GSA will charge for space and services furnished by GSA (unless otherwise exempted by the Administrator of General Services) a Rent charge which will approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. Rent for all assignments for GSA-controlled space will be priced according to the principles of the pricing policy in this part. These principles are reflected in the following elements of GSA Rent charges:

        (1) “Shell” Rent based on approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services for Federally owned space (accomplished using appraisal procedures);

        (2) Rent based on actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee;

        (3) Amortization of any tenant improvement allowance used;

        (4) Any applicable real estate taxes, operating costs, parking, security and joint use fees; and

        (5) For certain projects involving new construction or major renovation of Federally-owned buildings, a return on investment pricing approach if an appraisal-determined rental value does not provide a minimum return (OMB discount rate for calculating the present value of yearly costs plus 2%) on the cost of the prospective capital investment. Each specific use of Return on Investment (ROI) pricing must be approved by OMB and duly recorded in an Occupancy Agreement (OA) with the customer agency. Once the ROI methodology is employed to establish Rent for a capital investment, the ROI method must be retained for the duration of the OA term.

        (b) Special services not included in the standard levels of service may be provided by GSA on a reimbursable basis. GSA may also furnish alterations on a reimbursable basis in buildings where GSA is responsible for alterations only.

        (c) The financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a customer agency occupies, each block of GSA-controlled space, shall be documented in a written OA.

        § 102-85.20   What does an Occupancy Agreement (OA) do?

#### § § 102-85.20

        An OA defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency and:

        (a) Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights, and obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment;

        (b) Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and customer agencies;

        (c) Stabilizes Rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired by customers; and

        (d) Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer agency needs.

        § 102-85.25   What is the basic principle governing OAs?

#### § § 102-85.25

        The basic principle governing OAs is to adopt the private sector practice of capturing in a written document the business terms to which GSA and a customer agency agree concerning individual space assignments.

        § 102-85.30   Are there special rules for certain Federal customers?

#### § § 102-85.30

        Yes, in lieu of OAs, GSA is able to enter into agreements with customer agencies that reflect the parties particular needs. For example, the space and services provided to the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are governed by existing memoranda of agreement (MOA). When there are conflicts between the provisions of this part and MOAs, the MOAs prevail.

        § 102-85.35   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 102-85.35

        The following definitions apply to this part:

        or  means a commitment from an agency to occupy specified GSA-controlled space.

        means:

        (1) Space that is owned, leased, or otherwise controlled or operated by Federal agencies under any authority other than the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; and

        (2) it also includes agency-acquired space for which acquisition authority has been delegated or otherwise granted to the agency by GSA. It does not include space covered by an OA.

        or  is defined in the definition for space _assignment_.

        means the complete enveloping structure, the base-building systems, and the finished common areas (building common and floor common) of a building that bound the tenant areas.

        means any department, agency, or independent establishment in the Federal Government, including any wholly-owned corporation; any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol, and any activities under his direction).

        is a customer move that results from an extraordinary event such as a fire, natural disaster, or immediate threat to the health and safety of occupants that renders a current space assignment unusable and requires that it be vacated, permanently or temporarily.

        means the fund into which Rent charges and other revenues are deposited, and collections cited in section 210(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (U.S.C. 490(j)), and from which monies are available for expenditures for real property management and related activities in such amounts as are specified in annual appropriations acts without regard to fiscal year limitations.

        means workspace for which the United States Government has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, requisition, or condemnation. Such workspace excludes space owned or leased by private sector entities performing work on Government contracts.

        means space, the title to which is vested in the United States Government or which will vest automatically according to an existing agreement.

        means the involuntary physical relocation, from one space assignment to another, of a customer agency housed in GSA-controlled space initiated by another customer agency or by GSA, before the expiration of a lease or an OA term. (See also the definition of GSA-initiated move.)

        means all types of space other than “warehouse,” “parking,” or “unique” space, as defined elsewhere in this part. Examples of general use space are:

        (1) Office and office-related space such as file areas, libraries, meeting rooms, computer rooms, mail rooms, training and conference, automated data processing operations, courtrooms, and judicial chambers; and

        (2) Storage space that contains different quality and finishes from general use space, but that is within a building where predominantly general use space is located.

        means Federally controlled space under the custody or control of GSA. It includes space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance, or protection authority to the customer agency.

        means GSA-controlled space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance or protection authority to the customer agency.

        means any relocation action in GSA-controlled space that:

        (1) Is involuntary to the customer agency and required to be effective prior to the expiration of an effective OA, or in the case of leased space, prior to the expiration of the lease; or

        (2) Is an emergency relocation initiated by GSA.

        See definition of “tenant improvement.”

        means the specific placement of workstations, furniture and equipment within new space assignments.

        means a summary or itemized list of the real property, and associated descriptive information, that is under the control of a Federal agency.

        means common space within a Federally controlled facility, not specifically assigned to any one agency, and available for use by multiple agencies, such as cafeterias, auditoriums, conference rooms, credit unions, visitor parking spaces, snack bars, certain wellness/physical fitness facilities, and child care centers.

        means space for which the United States Government has a right of use and occupancy by virtue of having acquired a leasehold interest.

        means space that, due to its layout, design, location, or other characteristics, is unlikely to be needed by another GSA customer agency. Typical conditions that might cause space to be defined as non-cancelable are:

        (1) Special space construction features;

        (2) Lack of any realistic Federal need for the space other than by the requesting agency; and

        (3) Remote location or unusual term (short or long) desired by the agency.

        means a written agreement descriptive of the financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a customer agency occupies, the GSA-controlled space identified therein.

        or  means surface land, structures, or areas within structures designed and designated for the purpose of parking vehicles.

        means the peak number of persons to be housed during a single shift, regardless of how many workstations are provided for them. In addition to permanent employees of the agency, personnel includes temporaries, part-time, seasonal, and contractual employees, budgeted vacancies, and employees of other agencies and organizations who are housed in a space assignment.

        mean long term or “master” leases, usually negotiated to house several agencies whose individual term requirements differ from the terms of the underlying GSA lease with the lessor, and from each other. These may also be leases housing single agencies, but which entail for GSA responsibilities (burdens and benefits) which mimic an ownership position, or equity rights, even though no equity interest or ownership liability exists. An example of the latter would be long term renewal options on a lease which, in order to enjoy, involve substantial capital outlays by GSA to improve the building infrastructure. In both these cases, GSA is assuming risks or capital expenditures outside of the conventions of single transactions or occupancies. Accordingly, for a portfolio lease, it is not appropriate merely to pass through to the customer agency(ies) the rental rate of the underlying GSA lease. _Portfolio leases_ are treated for pricing purposes as owned space, with Rent set by appraisal.

        means the use to which the greatest portion of a location is put. _Predominant use_ is determined by the Public Buildings Service (PBS), GSA, and will typically result in the designation of a location as one of four types of space—General Use, Warehouse, Unique, or Parking—even though some smaller portions of the space may be used for one or more of the other types of uses.

        means the amounts charged by GSA for space and related services to the customer agencies with tenancy in GSA-controlled space. The word “_Rent_” is capitalized to differentiate it from the contract “rent” that GSA pays lessors.

        means the amount of space as defined in “Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)/American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z65.1-1996.” The BOMA/ANSI standard also defines “gross,” “office area,” “floor common,” and “building common” areas. Any references to these terms in this part refer to the BOMA/ANSI standard definitions. This standard has been adopted in accordance with GSA's interest in conforming its practices to nationally recognized industry standards to the extent possible.

        or  means a written or electronically submitted document or an oral request, within which an agency's space needs are summarized. A request for space is requisite for development of an OA. Thus, it must be submitted to GSA by a duly authorized official of the customer agency, and it must be accompanied by documentation of the customer agency's ability to fund payment of required Rent charges.

        is one possible methodology used to establish a Rent rate for certain owned space. Typically, ROI pricing is a Rent rate that ensures GSA a reasonable return on its cost to acquire and improve the asset. ROI pricing may be used where no other comparable commercial space is available or no other appraisal method would be appropriate. It may also be used in cases in which an appraisal-based rental rate will not meet GSA's minimum return requirements for the planned level of investment.

        mean Rent charges for building services provided by GSA's Federal Protective Service. _Security fees_ are comprised of basic and building specific charges.

        (a) A basic security fee is assessed in all PBS-controlled properties where the Federal Protective Service (FPS) provides security services. The rate is set annually on a per-square-foot basis. The charge includes the following services:

        (1) General law enforcement on PBS-controlled property;

        (2) Physical security assessments;

        (3) Crime prevention and awareness training;

        (4) Advice and assistance to building security committees;

        (5) Intelligence sharing program;

        (6) Criminal investigation;

        (7) Assistance and coordination in Occupancy Emergency Plan development;

        (8) Coordination of mobilization and response to terrorist threat or civil disturbance;

        (9) Program administration for security guard contracts; and

        (10) Megacenter operations for monitoring building perimeter alarms and dispatching appropriate law enforcement response.

        (b) The building specific security charge is comprised of two elements: Operating expenses and amortized capital costs. Building specific charges, whether operating expenses or capital costs, are distributed overall federal users by building or facility in direct proportion to each customer agency's percentage of federal occupancy. As with joint use charges, the distribution of building-specific charges among customer agencies is not re-adjusted for vacancy.

        means a defined area within a building and/or parcel of land. (Personal property and furniture are not included.)

        means a standard agreed upon by GSA and a customer agency, written in terms that permit nationwide or regional application, that is used as a basis for establishing that agency's space requirements. An SAS may describe special GSA and customer agency funding responsibilities, although such responsibilities will be covered in OAs for space assignments. An SAS may also be developed between GSA and customer agencies on a regional level to standardize or simplify transactions, provided that the terms of a regional SAS are consistent with the terms of that agency's national SAS and the terms of this part.

        or  means a transaction between GSA and a customer agency that results in a customer agency's right to occupy certain GSA-controlled space, usually in return for customer agency payment(s) to GSA for use of the space. _Space assignment_ rights, obligations, and responsibilities not covered in this part, or in the customer guides, are formalized in an OA.

        means the process of using recognized professional techniques of planning, layout and interior design to determine the best internal location and the most efficient configuration for satisfying agency space needs.

        means a summary statement of an agency's space needs. These requirements will generally include information about location, square footage, construction requirements, and duration of the agency's space need. They may be identified in any format mutually agreeable to GSA and the agency.

        means space which has unusual architectural/construction features, requires the installation of special equipment, or requires disproportionately high or low costs to construct, maintain and/or operate as compared to office or storage space. _Special space_ generally refers to space which has construction features, finishes, services, utilities, or other additional costs beyond those specified in the customer general allowance (e.g., courtrooms, laboratories).

        See § 102-85.165 for the definition of standard level of service.

        means electronic processing of information, either voice or data or both, over a wide variety of media, (e.g., copper wire, microwave, fiber optics, radio frequencies), between individuals or offices within a building (e.g., local area networks), between buildings, and between cities.

        means a finished component of an interior block of space. Tenant improvements represent additions to or alterations of the building shell that adapt the workspace to the specific uses of the customer. If made at initial occupancy, the TIs are known as initial space alterations or ISAs.

        means the dollar amount, including design, labor, materials, contractor costs (if contractors are used), management, and inspection, that GSA will spend to construct, alter, and finish space for customer occupancy (excluding personal property and furniture, which are customer agency responsibilities) at initial occupancy. The dollar amounts for the allowances are different for each agency and bureau to accommodate agencies' different mission needs. The dollar amounts also may vary by locations reflecting different costs in different markets. The PBS bill will only reflect the actual amount the customers spend, not the allowance. The amount of the TI allowance is determined by GSA. Agencies can request that GSA revise the TI allowance amount by project or categorically for an entire bureau. The cost of replacement of tenant improvements is borne by the customer agency.

        means space for which there is no commercial market comparable (e.g., border stations).

        or  means space contained in a structure primarily intended for the housing of files, records, equipment, or other personal property, and is not primarily intended for housing personnel and office operations. _Warehouse_ space generally is designed and constructed to lower specifications than office buildings, with features such as exposed ceilings, unfinished perimeter and few dividing partitions. Warehouse space also is usually heated to a lesser degree but not air-conditioned, and is cleaned to lesser standards than office space.

        means Federally controlled space in buildings and structures (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary) that provides an acceptable environment for the performance of agency mission requirements by employees or by other persons occupying it.

        § 102-85.40   What are the major components of the pricing policy?

#### § § 102-85.40

        The major components of the pricing policy are:

        (a) An OA between a customer agency and GSA;

        (b) Tenant improvement allowance; and

        (c) The establishment of Rent the agency pays to GSA based on the OA for:

        (1) Leased space, a pass-through to the customer agency of the underlying GSA lease contract costs, and a PBS fee; or

        (2) GSA-owned space, Rent determined by appraisal.

      Subpart B—Occupancy Agreement

        § 102-85.45   When is an Occupancy Agreement required?

#### § § 102-85.45

        An Occupancy Agreement (OA) is required for each customer agency's space assignment. The OA must be agreed to by GSA and the customer agency prior to GSA's commitment of funds for occupancy and formal assignment of space.

        § 102-85.50   When does availability of funding have to be certified?

#### § § 102-85.50

        The customer agency must sign an OA prior to GSA's making any major contractual commitments associated with the space request. Typically, this should occur at the earliest possible opportunity-i.e., when funds become available. However, in no event shall certification occur later than just prior to the award of the contract to a design architect in the case of Federal construction or renovation in Federally owned space or prior to the award of a lease. This serves as a customer agency's funding commitment unless certification is provided on another document.

        § 102-85.55   What are the terms and conditions included in an OA?

#### § § 102-85.55

        The terms and conditions are modeled after commercial practice. They are intended to reflect a full mutual understanding of the financial terms and agreement of the parties. The OA describes the actual space and services to be provided and all associated actual costs to the customer during the term of occupancy. The OA does not include any general provisions or terms contained in this part. OAs typically describe the following, depending on whether the space is leased or Federally owned:

        (a) Assigned square footage;

        (b) Shell Rent and term of occupancy;

        (c) Amortized amount of customer allowance used;

        (d) Operating costs and escalations;

        (e) One time charges; e.g., lump sum payments by the customer;

        (f) Real estate tax and escalations;

        (g) Parking and escalations;

        (h) Additional/reduced services;

        (i) Security services and associated Rent;

        (j) Joint use space and associated Rent;

        (k) PBS fee;

        (l) Customer rights and provisions for occupancy after OA expiration;

        (m) Cancellation provisions if different from this part or the customer service guides;

        (n) Any special circumstances associated with the occupancy, such as environmental responsibilities, unusual use restrictions, or agreements with local authorities;

        (o) Emergency relocations;

        (p) Clauses specific to the agreement;

        (q) Other Rent, e.g., charges for antenna sites, land;

        (r) Agency standard clauses; and

        (s) General clauses defining the obligations of both parties.

        § 102-85.60   Who can execute an OA?

#### § § 102-85.60

        Authorized GSA and customer agency officials who can commit or obligate the funds of their respective agencies can execute an OA. Higher level signatories may be appropriate from both agencies for space assignments in owned or leased space, that are unusual in size, location, duration, public interest, or other factors. Each agency decides its appropriate signatory level.

        § 102-85.65   How does an OA obligate the customer agency?

#### § § 102-85.65

        An OA obligates the executing customer agency to fund the current-year Rent obligation owed GSA, as well as to reimburse GSA for any other  obligations that GSA may have incurred on behalf of the customer agency. Although the OA is an interagency agreement, memorializing the understanding of GSA and its customer agency, the OA may not be construed as obligating future year customer agency funds until they are legally available. A multi-year OA commitment assumes the customer agency will seek the necessary funding through budget and appropriations processes.

        § 102-85.70   Are the standard OA terms appropriate for non-cancelable space?

#### § § 102-85.70

        Yes, most of the standard terms apply; however, the right to cancel upon a 4-month (120 day) notice is not available. See § 102-85.35 for the definition of non-cancelable space.

        § 102-85.75   When can space assignments be terminated?

#### § § 102-85.75

        (a) Customer agencies can terminate any space assignments, except those designated as non-cancelable, with the following stipulations:

        (1) The agency must give GSA written notice at least four months prior to termination.

        (2) The agency is responsible for reimbursing GSA for the unpaid balance of the cost of tenant improvements, generally prior to GSA releasing the agency from the space assignment. In the event the customer agency received a rent concession (e.g., free rent) at the inception of the assignment as part of the consideration for the entire lease term, then the amount of the concession applicable to the remaining term must be repaid to GSA.

        (3) If the space to be vacated is ready for occupancy by another customer and marketable, GSA accepts the termination of assignment.

        (4) If the agency has vacated all of the space and removed all personal property and equipment from the space by the cancellation date in the written notice, the agency will be released effective that date from further Rent payments.

        (5) An agency may terminate a GSA space assignment with less than a four-month advance written notice to GSA, if:

        (i) Either GSA or the terminating agency has identified another agency customer for the assigned space and that substitute agency wants and is able to fully assume the Rent payments due from the terminating agency; and

        (ii) The terminating agency continues to pay Rent until the new agency starts paying Rent.

        (b) GSA can terminate space assignments according to GSA regulations for emergency or forced moves.

        (c) OAs terminate automatically at expiration.

        § 102-85.80   Who is financially responsible for expenses resulting from tenant non-performance?

#### § § 102-85.80

        The customer agencies are financially responsible for expenses incurred by the Government as a result of any failure on their part to fulfill a commitment outlined in an OA or other written agreements in advance of, or in addition to, the OA. Customer agencies are also financially responsible for revised design costs and any additional costs resulting from changes to space requirements or space layouts made by the agency after a lease, alteration, design, or construction contract has been awarded by GSA.

        § 102-85.85   What if a customer agency participates in a consolidation?

#### § § 102-85.85

        If an agency agrees to participate in a consolidation upon expiration of an OA, the relocation expenses will be addressed in the new OA negotiated by GSA and the customer agency. The customer agency generally pays such costs.

      Subpart C—Tenant Improvement Allowance

        § 102-85.90   What is a tenant improvement allowance?

#### § § 102-85.90

        A tenant improvement (TI) allowance enables the customer agency to design, configure and build out space to support its program operations. It is based on local market construction costs and the specific bureau's historical use of space. (See also the definition at § 102-85.35.)

        § 102-85.95   Who pays for the TI allowance?

#### § § 102-85.95

        The customer agency pays for the amount of the tenant improvement allowance actually used.

        § 102-85.100   How does a customer agency pay for tenant improvements?

#### § § 102-85.100

        To pay for the installation of tenant improvements, the customer agency may spend an amount not to exceed the tenant allowance. The amount spent by the customer agency for TIs is amortized over a period of time specified in the OA, not to exceed the useful life of the improvements. This amortization payment is in addition to the shell rent and services.

        § 102-85.105   How does an agency pay for customer alterations that exceed the TI allowance?

#### § § 102-85.105

        Amounts exceeding the TI allowance are paid in a one-time lump sum and are not amortized over the term of the occupancy. The agency certifies lump sum funds are available prior to GSA proceeding with the work.

        § 102-85.110   Can the allowance amount be changed?

#### § § 102-85.110

        The GSA schedule of allowances for new assignments is adjusted annually for design and construction cost changes. As the need arises, GSA may adjust an agency or bureau's TI allowance. GSA may also adjust a TI allowance for a specific project, if conditions warrant. This decision is solely GSA's. In addition, the customer agency may waive any part or all of its customization allowance in the case of a new space assignment. In the case of backfill space (also known as relet space), the customer agency can also waive any part or all of the tenant general allowance, if the customer agency will use the existing tenant improvements, with or without modifications.

      Subpart D—Rent Charges

        § 102-85.115   How is the Rent determined?

#### § § 102-85.115

        Unless an exemption is granted under the authority of the Administrator of General Services, the Rent charged approximates commercial charges for comparable space and space-related services as follows:

        (a) Generally, Rent for Federally owned space provided by GSA is based on market appraisals of fully serviced rental values for the predominant use to which space in a building is put; e.g., general use, warehouse use, and parking use. In cases where market appraisals are not practical; e.g., in cases involving unique space or when market comparables are not available, GSA may establish Rent on the basis of alternate commercial practices. See the discussion of alternate valuation methods in § 102-85.125. Amortization of tenant improvements, parking fees, and security charges are calculated separately and added to the appraised shell Rent to establish the Rent charge. Customer agencies also pay for a pro rata share of joint use space.

        (b) Generally, Rent for space leased by GSA is based on the actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee, and security charges and parking (if not in the lease).

        (1) The Rent is based on the terms and conditions of the OA, starting with the shell Rent.

        (2) In addition to the shell Rent, the Rent includes amortization of TI allowances used, real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services, parking, GSA fee for its services, and charges for security, joint-use, and other applicable rental charges (e.g., antenna site, land, wareyard).

        § 102-85.120   What is shell Rent?

#### § § 102-85.120

        Shell Rent is that portion of GSA Rent charged for the building envelope and land. (See § 102-85.35 for the definition of building shell.)

        § 102-85.125   What alternate methods may be used to establish Rent in Federally-owned space?

#### § § 102-85.125

        Alternate methods of establishing Rent are based on private sector models. They include, but are not limited to:

        (a) Return on investment (ROI) approach or a similar cost recovery method used when market comparables are not available and/or GSA must “build to suit” to fulfill customer agency requirements; e.g., border stations; and

        (b) Rent schedules for the right to use rooftops and other floor areas not suitable for workspace; e.g., antenna sites and signage.

        § 102-85.130   How are exemptions from Rent granted?

#### § § 102-85.130

        Exemptions from Rent are rare. However, the Administrator of General Services may exempt any GSA customer from Rent after a determination that application of Rent would not be feasible or practical. Customer agency requests for exemptions must be addressed to the Administrator of General Services and submitted in accordance with GSA Order PBS 4210.1, “Rent Exemption Procedures,” dated December 20, 1991, or in accordance with any superseding GSA order. A copy of the order may be obtained from the Office of Portfolio Management, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

        § 102-85.135   What if space and services are provided by other executive agencies?

#### § § 102-85.135

        Any executive agency other than GSA providing space and services is authorized to charge the occupant for the space and services at rates approved by the Administrator of General Services and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. If space and services are of the type provided by the Administrator of General Services, the executive agency providing the space and services must credit the monies derived from any fees or charges to the appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the space or services, as prescribed by Subsection 210(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(k)).

        § 102-85.140   How are changes in Rent reflected in OAs?

#### § § 102-85.140

        (a) If Rent changes in ways that are identified in the OA, then no change to the OA is required. Typically, OAs state that certain components of Rent are subject to annual escalation; e.g., operating expenses, real estate taxes, parking charges, the basic security charge, and building-specific security operating and amortized capital expenses which do not entail a change in service level. Also, in Federally-owned space, OAs state that the shell rent is re-marked to market every five years. In leased space, the OA will identify any programmed changes in the lease contract rent (such as pre-set increases or steps in the contract rent rate) that will translate into a change in the customer agency's Rent. Changes in Rent specified in OAs will serve as notice to agencies of future Rent changes for budgeting purposes. For a discussion of budgeting for Rent, see § 102-85.160.

        (b) Changes to Rent other than those identified in paragraph (a) of this section typically require an amended OA. There are many events that might occasion a change in Rent, and an amended OA, such as:

        (1) An agency expands or contracts at an existing location;

        (2) PBS agrees to fund additional tenant improvements that are then amortized over the remaining OA term, or over an extended OA term;

        (3) Upon physical re-measurement, the true square footage of the space assignment is found to be different from the square footage of record;

        (4) The amount of joint use space in the building changes;

        (5) The level of building-specific security services changes; or

        (6) PBS undertakes new capital expenditures for new or enhanced security countermeasures.

        § 102-85.145   When are customer agencies responsible for Rent charges?

#### § § 102-85.145

        (a) When a customer agency occupies cancelable space, it is responsible for Rent charges until:

        (1) The date of release specified in the OA, or until the date space is actually vacated, whichever occurs later; or

        (2) Four months after having provided GSA written notice of release; or

        (3) The date space is actually vacated, whenever occupancy extends beyond the date agreed upon under either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

        (b) When a customer agency releases non-cancelable space, it is responsible for all attributable Rent and other space charges until the OA expires. This responsibility is mitigated to the extent that GSA is able to assign the space to another user or dispose of it. (See § 102-85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?)

        (c) When a customer agency commits to occupy space in an OA or other binding document, but never occupies that space, that agency is responsible for:

        (1) Non-cancelable space: Rent payments due for the space until the OA expires, unless GSA can mitigate; or

        (2) All other space: Either GSA's space charges for 4 months plus the cost of tenant improvements or GSA's actual costs, whichever is less.

        § 102-85.150   How will Rent charges be reflected on the customer agency's Rent bill?

#### § § 102-85.150

        Rent charges are billed monthly, in arrears, based on an annual rate which is divided by 12. Billing commences the first month in which the agency occupies the space for more than half of the month, and ends in the last month the agency occupies the space.

        § 102-85.155   What does a customer agency do if it does not agree with a Rent bill?

#### § § 102-85.155

        (a) If a customer agency does not agree with the way GSA has determined its Rent obligation (e.g., the agency does not agree with GSA's space classification, appraised Rent, or the allocation of space), the agency may appeal its Rent bill to GSA.

        (b) GSA will not increase or otherwise change Rent for any assignment, except as agreed in an OA, in the case of errors, or when the OA is amended. However, customer agencies may at any time request a regional review of the measurement, classification, service levels provided, or charges assessed that pertain to the space assignment without resorting to formal procedures. Such requests do not constitute appeals and should be directed to the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator.

        (c) If a customer agency still wants to pursue a formal appeal of Rent charges, they may do so, but with the following limitations:

        (1) Terms, including rates, to which the parties agree in an OA are not appealable;

        (2) In leased space, the contract rent passed through from the underlying lease cannot be appealed;

        (3) In GSA-owned space, when the fully-serviced shell Rent is established through appraisal, the appraised rate must exceed comparable commercial square foot rates by 20 percent. When shell Rent in owned space is established on the basis of ROI at the inception of an OA, and the customer agency executes the OA, then the ROI rate cannot later be appealed. Other components of Rent that are established on the basis of actual cost—eg., amortization of TIs and building specific security charges—also cannot be appealed.

        (4) Additionally, the customer agency is required to compare its assigned space with other space in the surrounding community that:

        (i) Is available in similar size block of space in a comparable location;

        (ii) Is comparable in quality to the space provided by GSA;

        (iii) Provides similar service levels as part of the charges;

        (iv) Contains similar contractual terms, conditions, and escalations clauses; and

        (v) Represents a lease transaction completed at a similar point in time.

        (5) Data from at least three comparable locations will be necessary to demonstrate a market trend sufficient to warrant revising an appraised Rent charge.

        (d) A customer agency filing an appeal for a particular location or building must develop documentation supporting the appeal and file the appeal with the appropriate Regional Administrator. The GSA regional office will verify all pertinent information and documentation supporting the appeal. The GSA Regional Administrator will accept or deny the appeal and will notify the appealing agency of his or her ruling.

        (e) A further appeal may be filed by the customer agency's headquarters level officials with the Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, if equitable resolution has not been obtained from the initial appeal. A head of a customer agency may further appeal to the Administrator of the General Services. Documentation of the procedures followed for prior resolution must accompany an appeal to the Administrator. Decisions made by the Administrator are final.

        (f) Adjustments of Rent resulting from reviews and appeals will be effective in the month that the agency submitted a properly documented appeal. Adjustments in Rent made under this section remain in effect for the remainder of the 5-year period in which the charges cited in the OA were applicable.

        § 102-85.160   How does a customer agency know how much to budget for Rent?

#### § § 102-85.160

        GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate, shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to:

        (a) New assignments;

        (b) Changes in current assignments;

        (c) Leased space;

        (d) New tenant improvement amortization;

        (e) Building specific security costs; and

        (f) New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due to changes in scope of proposed projects or repair and/or replacement of building components

      Subpart E—Standard Levels of Service

        § 102-85.165   What are standard levels of service?

#### § § 102-85.165

        (a) The standard levels of service covered by GSA Rent are comparable to those furnished in commercial practice. They are based on the effort required to service the customer agency's space for a 5-day week (Monday to Friday), one-shift regular work schedule. GSA will provide adequate building startup services, before the beginning of the customer's regular one-shift work schedule, and shutdown services after the end of this schedule.

        (b) Without additional charge, GSA customers may use their assigned space and supporting automatic elevator systems, lights and small office and business machines including personal computers on an incidental basis, unless specified otherwise in the OA.

        § 102-85.170   Can flexitime and other alternative work schedules cost the customer agency more?

#### § § 102-85.170

        Yes, GSA customers who extend their regular work schedule by a system of flexible hours shall reimburse GSA for its approximate cost of the additional services required.

        § 102-85.175   Are the standard level services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance identified in an OA?

#### § § 102-85.175

        Unless specified otherwise in the OA, standard level services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance shall be provided in accordance with the GSA standard level of services as defined in § 102-85.165, and in the PBS Customer Guide to Real Property. A copy of the guide may be obtained from the General Services Administration, Office of Business Performance (PX), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

        § 102-85.180   Can there be other standard services?

#### § § 102-85.180

        GSA may provide additional services to its customers at the levels and times deemed by the Administrator of General Services to be necessary for efficient operations and proper servicing of space under the assignment responsibility of GSA.

        § 102-85.185   Can space be exempted from the standard levels of service

#### § § 102-85.185

        Yes, customer agencies may be excused from paying for standard service levels for space assignments when:

        (a) In GSA-delegated space, the customer agency provides for these services itself and thus pays Rent minus charges for these services; or

        (b) In rare instances, standard service levels may be waived by the Administrator of General Services in instances where charging for such standard services would not be feasible or practical, e.g., in assignments of limited square footage or functional use.

        § 102-85.190   Can GSA Rent be adjusted when standard levels of service are performed by other customer agencies?

#### § § 102-85.190

        Customer agencies that arrange and pay separately for the costs of standard level services normally covered by GSA Rent will receive a Rent credit or other type of reimbursement by GSA for the amount GSA would have charged for such services. The type of reimbursement is at GSA's discretion. The reimbursement is limited to the amount included for the services in GSA Rent. Approval to perform or contract for such services must be obtained in advance by the customer agency from the appropriate GSA regional office.

      Subpart F—Special Services

        § 102-85.195   Does GSA provide special services?

#### § § 102-85.195

        Yes, GSA provides special services on a cost-reimbursable basis:

        (a) In GSA-controlled space, GSA may provide for special services that cannot be separated from the building or space costs (inseparable services, such as utilities, which are not individually metered). GSA's estimate of the special service cost is the basis for the bill amount. The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee for GSA's services.

        (b) GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.

      Subpart G—Continued Occupancy, Relocation and Forced Moves

        § 102-85.200   Can customer agencies continue occupancy of space or must they relocate at the end of an OA?

#### § § 102-85.200

        The answer is contingent upon whether the customer agency is in Federally owned or leased space.

        (a) Unless stated otherwise in the OA, a customer agency within a GSA controlled, Federally owned building has automatic occupancy rights at the end of the OA term for occupied space. However, a new OA must be negotiated.

        (b) In leased space, the OA generally reflects the provisions of the underlying lease and will specify whether or not renewal options are available. If the OA does not include a renewal option, customer agencies should assume relocation would be necessary upon OA expiration, and budget for it. Further, renewal options are not, in themselves, a guarantee of continued occupancy at that location. In some cases, the renewal rate is substantially above market or the option was not part of the initial price evaluation for the occupancy. In such cases, GSA may be required to run a competition for the replacement lease, and a relocation may ensue. Nonetheless, it is also possible that GSA may execute a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor, in which case there is no move.

        (c) GSA and customer agencies should initiate discussions at least 18-20 months in advance of OA expiration to address an action for the replacement or continued occupancy of the existing space assignment. This allows both agencies time to budget for the work and the cost.

        § 102-85.205   What happens if a customer agency continues occupancy after the expiration of an OA?

#### § § 102-85.205

        A mutual goal of GSA and its customers is to have current OAs in place for all space assignments. However, provisions are necessary to cover the GSA and customer relationship if an OA expires prior to execution of a mutually desired succeeding agreement. Because the risks, liabilities, and consequences of a customer's continued occupancy depend on whether the assigned space is leased or Federally owned, different provisions in the following table apply:

        § 102-85.210   What if a customer agency has to relocate?

#### § § 102-85.210

        If the agency or GSA determines relocation is necessary at the expiration of an OA for either Federally owned or leased space, the customer agency is responsible for all costs associated with relocation at that time.

        § 102-85.215   What if another customer agency forces a GSA customer to move?

#### § § 102-85.215

        If a GSA customer agency, or GSA, forces the relocation of another GSA customer agency prior to the expiration of the customer's OA, the “forcing” agency is responsible:

        (a) For all reasonable costs associated with the relocation of the agency being “forced” to move, including architectural-engineering design, move coordination and physical relocation, telecommunications and ADP equipment relocation and installation;

        (b) To GSA for all of the relocated agency's unpaid tenant improvements, if any; and

        (c) To the customer agency for the undepreciated amount of any lump sum payment that was already made by the agency for alterations.

        § 102-85.220   Can a customer agency forced to relocate waive the reimbursements?

#### § § 102-85.220

        Yes, a customer agency forced to relocate can waive some or all of the reimbursements from the forcing agency that are prescribed in § 102-85.215. However, a relocated customer agency cannot waive the requirement for the forcing customer agency to reimburse GSA for unpaid tenant improvements. If GSA is the “forcing” agency, it is responsible for the same costs as any other forcing customer agency.

        § 102-85.225   What are the funding responsibilities for relocations resulting from emergencies?

#### § § 102-85.225

        (a) In emergencies, swift remedies, including the possible relocation of a customer agency to alternate space, are required. The remedies may include requests for funding authorizations from OMB and Congress. GSA may serve as the central coordinator of such remedies.

        (b) Funding responsibility will vary by situation. If a customer agency is only temporarily displaced from its space, GSA typically covers the cost of temporary set-up in a provisional location. If the agency is obliged to relocate permanently, an OA will be prepared which will address all terms of the occupancy. In such cases, new tenant improvements will be constructed which can be amortized over the life of a new occupancy term, and a new Rent rate will be developed.

        is an action to exclude a TSP, for a period of time, from providing services under a rate tender or any contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.406).

        means the actual value of cargo as declared by the agency for reimbursement purposes or to establish duties, taxes, or other customs fees. The  is the maximum amount that could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage for the shipments of freight and household goods, unless the _declared value_ exceeds the carrier's released value (see “Released value”). The statement of declared value must be shown on any applicable tariff, tender, contract, bill of lading, or other document covering the shipment.

      Subpart C—Business Rules To Consider Before Shipping Freight or Household Goods

        § 102-117.100   What business rules must I consider before acquiring transportation or related services?

#### § § 102-117.100

        When acquiring transportation or related services you must:

        (a) Use the mode or individual transportation service provider (TSP) that provides the overall best value to the agency. For more information, see §§ 102-117.105 through 102-117.130;

        (b) Demonstrate no preferential treatment to any TSP when arranging for transportation services except on international shipments. Preference on international shipments must be given to United States registered commercial vessels and aircraft;

        (c) Ensure that small businesses receive equal opportunity to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);

        (d) Encourage minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses, to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);

        (e) Review the need for insurance. Generally, the Government is self-insured; however, there are instances when the Government will purchase insurance coverage for Government property. An example may be cargo insurance for international air cargo shipments to cover losses over those allowed under the International Air Transport Association (IATA) or for ocean freight shipments; and

        (f) Consider the added requirements on international transportation found in subpart D of this part.

        § 102-117.120   To what extent must I equally distribute orders for transportation and related services among TSPs?

#### § § 102-117.120

        You must assure that small businesses, socially or economically disadvantaged and women-owned TSPs have equal opportunity to provide the transportation or related services.

        § 102-117.125   How detailed must I describe property for shipment when communicating to a TSP?

#### § § 102-117.125

        You must describe property in enough detail for the TSP to determine the type of equipment or any special precautions necessary to move the shipment. Details might include weight, volume, measurements, routing, hazardous cargo, or special handling designations.

        § 102-117.130   Must I select TSPs who use alternative fuels?

#### § § 102-117.130

        No, but, whenever possible, you are encouraged to select TSPs that use alternative fuel vehicles and equipment, under policy in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 7612) or the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13212).

      Subpart D—Restrictions That Affect International Transportation of Freight and Household Goods

        § 102-117.135   What are the international transportation restrictions?

#### § § 102-117.135

        Several statutes mandate the use of U.S. flag carriers for international shipments, such as 49 U.S.C. 40118, commonly referred to as the “Fly America Act”, and 46 U.S.C. 55305, the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended. The principal restrictions are as follows:

        (a)  The use of foreign-flag air carriers when funded by the U.S. Government should be rare. International movement of cargo by air is subject to the Fly America Act, 49 U.S.C. 40118, which requires the use of U.S. flag air carrier service for all air cargo movements funded by the U.S. Government, including cargo shipped by contractors, grantees, and others at Government expense, except when one of the following exceptions applies:

        (1) The transportation is provided under a bilateral or multilateral air transportation agreement to which the U.S. Government and the government of a foreign country are parties, and which the Department of Transportation has determined meets the requirements of the Fly America Act.

        (i) Information on bilateral or multilateral air transport agreements impacting U.S. Government procured transportation can be accessed at  and

        (ii) If determined appropriate, GSA may periodically issue FMR Bulletins providing further guidance on bilateral or multilateral air transportation agreements impacting U.S. Government procured transportation. These bulletins may be accessed at

        (2) When the costs of transportation are reimbursed in full by a third party, such as a foreign government, an international agency, or other organization; or

        (3) Use of a foreign air carrier is determined to be a matter of necessity by your agency, on a case-by-case basis, when:

        (i) No U.S. flag air carrier can provide the specific air transportation needed;

        (ii) No U.S. flag air carrier can meet the time requirements in cases of emergency;

        (iii) There is a lack of or inadequate U.S. flag air carrier aircraft;

        (iv) There is an unreasonable risk to safety when using a U.S. flag carrier aircraft ( terrorist threats).

        Your agency's internal financial regulations will identify responsibility for recordkeeping. In addition, the GSA Transportation Audits Division keeps a central repository of electronic transportation billing records for legal and auditing purposes. Therefore, your agency must utilize the Transportation Audits Management System (TAMS) () to submit all relevant electronic transportation billing documents or submit via email to:

        § 102-118.85   Can my agency use a Government contractor issued charge card to pay for transportation services?

#### § § 102-118.85

        Yes, your agency may use a Government contractor issued charge card to purchase transportation services if permitted under the charge card contract or task order. In these circumstances your agency will receive a bill for these services from the charge card company.

        § 102-118.90   If my agency orders transportation and/or transportation services with a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation, is this subject to prepayment audit?

#### § § 102-118.90

        Generally, no transportation or transportation services ordered with a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation can be prepayment audited because the bank or charge card contractor pays the TSP directly, before your agency receives a bill that can be audited from the charge card company. However, if your agency contracts with the charge card or charge account provider to provide for a prepayment audit, then, as long as your agency is not liable for paying the bank for improper charges (as determined by the prepayment audit verification process), a prepayment audit can be used. As with all prepayment audit programs, the charge card prepayment audit must be approved by the GSA Transportation Audits Division prior to implementation. If the charge card contract does not provide for a prepayment audit, your agency must submit the transportation line items on the charge card to the GSA Transportation Audits Division for a postpayment audit.

        § 102-118.91   May my agency authorize the use of cash?

#### § § 102-118.91

        Yes, in limited circumstances, a Government employee can use cash where government payment mechanisms are not available or acceptable.

> [69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004]

        § 102-118.92   How does my agency handle receipts, tickets or other records of cash payments?

#### § § 102-118.92

        Your agency must ensure that its employees keep the original receipts for transportation purchases over $75.00 made with cash. If it is impractical to furnish receipts in any instance as required by this subtitle, the failure to do so must be fully explained on the travel voucher. Mere inconvenience in the matter of taking receipts will not be considered. These receipts must be saved for a possible postpayment audit by the GSA Transportation Audits Division. If your agency requires the filing of paper receipts, then you must do so. For transportation purchases over $75.00, your agency must ensure that copies of all original papers are retained at your agency.

> [69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 30475, June 26, 2009; 87 FR 32324, May 31, 2022]

        § 102-118.95   What forms can my agency use to pay transportation bills?

#### § § 102-118.95

        Your agency must use commercial payment practices and forms to the maximum extent possible; however, when viewed necessary by your agency, your agency may use the following Government forms to pay transportation bills:

        (a) Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, and SF 1113-A, Memorandum Copy;

        (b) Standard Form (SF) 1103, Government Bill of Lading (used for movement of things, both privately owned and Government property for official uses);

        (c) OF 1169, Government Transportation Request (used to pay for tickets to move people); and

        (d) Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of Lading (used by the Department of Defense to move private property for official transfers).

        § 102-118.115   Must my agency use a GBL?

#### § § 102-118.115

        No. Your agency is required to use commercial payment practices to the maximum extent possible. Your agency may use a GBL as needed for domestic shipments and should use a GBL for international shipments. When used for shipments, a GBL is a receipt of goods, evidence of title, and a contract of carriage for Government shipments and was developed to protect the interest of the U.S. Government.

        No, your agency is not required to use a GTR. Your agency must adopt commercial practices and eliminate GTR use to the maximum extent possible.

        § 102-118.125   What if my agency uses a TD other than a GBL?

#### § § 102-118.125

        If your agency uses any other TD for shipping under its account, the requisite and the named safeguards must be in place (i.e., terms and conditions found herein and in the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation—Handbook,” appropriate numbering, etc.).

        § 102-118.130   Must my agency use a GBL for express, courier, or small package shipments?

#### § § 102-118.130

        No, however, in using commercial forms all shipments must be subject to the terms and conditions set forth for use of a bill of lading for the Government. Any other non-conflicting applicable contracts or agreements between the TSP and an agency involving buying transportation services for Government traffic remain binding. This purchase does not require a SF 1113.

The TSP, providing service under the bill of lading, must present a legible copy of the bill of lading or an original, properly certified GBL attached to Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment. An agency may choose not to require that an SF 1113 be attached to the bill of lading and invoice if the TSP submits invoices using the agency's approved third-party payment system (TPPS);

        (b) The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading. (This is commonly referred to as an alternation of rates);

        (c) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering TSP's documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. If loss or damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, the consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last delivering TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the shipment;

        (d) The rules and conditions governing commercial shipments for the time period within which notice must be given to the TSP, or a claim must be filed, or suit must be instituted, shall not apply if the shipment is lost, damaged or undergoes shrinkage in transit. Only with the written concurrence of the Government official responsible for making the shipment is the deletion of this item considered to be valid;

        (e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on the overcharges made and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982 31 U.S.C. 3717); and

        (f) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation—Handbook.”

        § 102-118.155   How does my agency handle supplemental billings from the TSP after payment of the original bill?

#### § § 102-118.155

        Your agency must process, review, and verify supplemental billings using the same procedures as on an original billing. If the TSP disputes the findings, your agency must attempt to resolve the disputed amount.

        § 102-118.160   Who is liable if my agency makes an overpayment on a transportation bill?

#### § § 102-118.160

        If the agency conducts prepayment audits of its transportation bills, agency transportation certifying and disbursing officers are liable for any overpayments made. If GSA has granted a waiver to the prepayment audit requirement and the agency performs a postpayment audit (31 U.S.C. 3528 and 31 U.S.C. 3322) neither the certifying nor disbursing officers are liable for the reasons listed in these two cited statutes.

        § 102-118.165   What must my agency do if it finds an error on a TSP bill?

#### § § 102-118.165

      Subpart D—Prepayment Audit of Transportation Services

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 65300, Sept. 22, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

        Agency Requirements for a Transportation Prepayment Audit Program

          § 102-118.265   What is a prepayment audit?

#### § § 102-118.265

          Prepayment audit means a review of transportation documentation before payment to determine their validity, propriety, and conformity of rates with tariffs, quotations, agreements, contracts, or tenders. Prepayment auditing by your agency will detect and eliminate billing errors before payment (31 U.S.C. 3726).

          § 102-118.270   Must my agency establish a transportation prepayment audit program, and how is it funded?

#### § § 102-118.270

          (a) Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3726, your agency is required to establish a transportation prepayment audit program. Your agency's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) must approve the prepayment audit program.

          (b) Your agency must pay for the prepayment audit program from those funds appropriated for transportation services.

          (1) Agencies are encouraged to consider using a GSA Transportation Audits Division approved third party electronic payment processor for transportation invoice processing, payment, and prepayment audit. These electronic payment processors are no cost to the agency and are fully compliant with GSA Transportation Audits Division prepayment audit requirements.

          (2) Use of these third party payment processors generally means your agency will not have to provide any additional prepayment or postpayment documentation to GSA Transportation Audits Division.

          § 102-118.275   What must my agency consider when developing a transportation prepayment audit program?

#### § § 102-118.275

          (a) Your agency's transportation prepayment audit program must consider all of the methods that your agency uses to order and pay for passenger, household goods, and freight transportation to include Government contractor-issued charge cards (see § 102-118.35 for definition Government contractor-issued charge cards).

          (b) Each method of ordering transportation and transportation services for passenger, household goods, and freight transportation may require a different kind of prepayment audit process. The manner in which your agency orders or procures transportation services determines how and by whom the bill for those services will be presented. Your agency should ensure that each TSP bill or employee travel voucher contains enough information for the prepayment audit to determine which contract or rate tender is used and that the type and quantity of any additional services are clearly delineated.

          (c) The prepayment audit cannot be conducted by the same firm providing the transportation services for the agency. If a move manager is being utilized, the move manager may not have any affiliation with or financial interest in the transportation company providing the transportation services for which the prepayment audit is being conducted. Contracts with charge card companies that provide prepayment audit services are a valid option. The agency can choose to—

          (1) Create an internal prepayment audit program;

          (2) Contract directly with a prepayment audit service provider;

          (3) Use the services of a prepayment audit contractor under GSA's multiple award schedule covering audit services, including transportation prepayment audit services (541211 Auditing Services); or

          (4) Use a third-party payment system (TPPS) or charge card company that includes prepayment audit functions.

#### § § 102-192.65

          All agencies must have an accountable system for making postage payments; that is, a system that allocates postage expenses at the program level within the agency and makes program level managers accountable for obligating and tracking those expenses. The agency will have to determine the appropriate program level for this requirement because the level at which it is cost beneficial differs widely. The agency's finance systems should track all mail expenditures separately to the program level or below, and should—

          (a) Show expenses for postage and all other mail expenditures, payments to service providers, etc., separate from all other administrative expenses;

          (b) Allow mail centers to establish systems to charge their customers for mail expenditures; and

          (d) The scope and level of detail of each facility mail security plan should be commensurate with the size and responsibilities of each facility. For small facilities, agencies may use a general plan for similar locations. For larger locations, agencies must develop a plan that is specifically tailored to the threats and risks at your location. Agencies should determine which facilities they consider small and large for the purposes of this section, so long as the basic requirements for a security plan are met at every facility.

          (e) All mail managers are required to annually report the status of their mail security plans to agency headquarters. At a minimum, these reports should assure that all mail security plans comply with the requirements of this part, including annual review by a subject matter expert and regular rehearsal of responses to various emergency situations by facility personnel.

          (f) A security professional who has expertise in mail center security should review the agency's mail security plan and policies annually to include identification of any deficiencies. Review of facility mail security plans can be accomplished by subject matter experts such as agency security personnel. If these experts are not available within your agency, seek assistance from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service () or the Federal Protective Service (FPS) ().

The FPS has developed standards for building construction and management, including standards for mail centers. At a minimum, the agency mail security plan must address the following topics:

          (a) Risk assessment;

          (b) A plan to protect staff and all other occupants of agency facilities from hazards that might be delivered in the mail;

      § 102-194.20   What is an electronic Standard or Optional form?

#### § § 102-194.20

      An electronic Standard or Optional form is an officially prescribed set of data residing in an electronic medium that is used to produce a mirror-like image or as near to a mirror-like image as the creation software will allow of the officially prescribed form.

      § 102-194.25   What is an automated Standard or Optional format?

#### § § 102-194.25

      An automated Standard or Optional format is an electronic version of the officially prescribed form containing the same data elements and used for the electronic transaction of information in lieu of using a Standard or Optional form.

      § 102-194.30   What role does my agency play in the Standard and Optional Forms Management Program?

#### § § 102-194.30

      Your agency head or designee's role is to:

      (a) Designate an agency-level Standard and Optional Forms Liaison representative and alternate, and notify GSA, in writing, of their names, titles, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses within 30 days of the designation or redesignation.

      (b) Promulgate Governmentwide Standard forms under the agency's statutory or regulatory authority in the  and issue procedures on the mandatory use, revision, or cancellation of these forms.

      (c) Ensure that the agency complies with the provisions of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) (Public Law 105-277, 112 Stat 2681), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 74d), as amended, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Standards (36 CFR part 1194), and OMB implementing guidance. In particular, agencies should allow the submission of Standard and Optional forms in an electronic/automated version unless the form is specifically exempted by § 102-194.40.

      (d) Issue Governmentwide Optional forms when needed by two or more agencies and announce the availability, revision, or cancellation of these forms. Forms prescribed through a regulation for use by the Federal Government must be issued as a Standard form.

      (e) Obtain GSA approval for each new, revised or canceled Standard and Optional form, 60 days prior to planned implementation. Certify that the forms comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Provide an electronic form unless exempted by § 102-194.40. Revised forms not approved by GSA will result in cancellation of the form.

      (f) Provide GSA with both an electronic (unless exempted by § 102-194.40) and paper version of the official image of the Standard or Optional form prior to implementation.

      (g) Obtain the prescribing agency's approval for exceptions to Standard and Optional forms, including electronic forms or automated formats prior to implementation.

      (h) Review annually agency prescribed Standard and Optional forms, including exceptions, for improvement, consolidation, cancellation, or possible automation. The review must include approved electronic versions of the forms.

      (i) Coordinate all health-care related Standard and Optional forms through GSA for the approval of the Interagency Committee on Medical Records (ICMR).

      (j) Promote the use of electronic forms within the agency by following what the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) prescribes and all guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget and other responsible agencies. This guidance will promote the use of electronic transactions and electronic signatures.

      (k) Notify GSA of the replacement of any Standard or Optional form by an automated format or electronic form, and its impact on the need to stock the paper form. GSA's approval is not necessary for this change, but a one-time notification should be made.

      (l) Follow the specific instructions in the Standard and Optional Forms Procedural Handbook.

      § 102-194.35   Should I create electronic Standard or Optional forms?

#### § § 102-194.35

      Yes, you should create electronic Standard or Optional forms, especially when forms are used to collect information from the public. GSA will not approve a new or revision to a Standard or Optional form unless an electronic form is being made available. Only forms covered by § 102-194.40 are exempt from this requirement. Furthermore, you should to the extent possible, use electronic form products and services that are based on open standards. However, the use of proprietary products is permitted, provided that the end user is not required to purchase a specific product or subscription to use the electronic Standard or Optional form.

      § 102-194.40   For what Standard or Optional forms should an electronic version not be made available?

#### § § 102-194.40

      All forms should include an electronic version unless it is not practicable to do so. Areas where it may not be practicable include where the form has construction features for specialized use (e.g., labels), to prevent unauthorized use or could otherwise risk a security violation, (e.g., classification cover sheets), or require unusual production costs (e.g., specialized paper or envelopes). Such forms can be made available as an electronic form only if the originating agency approves an exception to do so. (See the Standard and Optional Forms Procedural Handbook for procedures and a list of these forms).
