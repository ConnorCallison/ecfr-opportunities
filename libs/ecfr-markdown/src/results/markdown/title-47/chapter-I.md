        § 80.60   Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

#### § § 80.60

        (a) Except as specified in § 20.15(c) of this chapter with respect to commercial mobile radio service providers, charges must not be made for service of:

        (1) VHF Public Coast area licen_see_s,  § 80.371(c)(1)(ii), may partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their spectrum pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section.

        (2) AMTS geographic area licen_see_s,  § 80.385(a)(3), may partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their spectrum pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. Site-based AMTS public coast station licensees may partition their license or disaggregate their spectrum pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section, provided that the partitionee or disaggregatee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour does not extend beyond the partitioner or disaggregator's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour. The predicted 38 dBu signal level contours shall be calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction for antenna height differential.

        (3) Nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF public coast station licen_see_s,  §§ 80.357(b)(1), 80.361(a), 80.363(a)(2), 80.371(b), and 80.374, may partition their spectrum pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section, except that frequencies or frequency pairs licensed to more than one licensee as of March 13, 2002 may be partitioned only by the earliest licensee, and only on the condition that the partitionee shall operate on a secondary, non-interference basis to stations licensed as of March 13, 2002 other than the earliest licensee. Coordination with government users is required for partitioning of spectrum the licensing of which is subject to coordination with government users.

        (b) —(1)  In the case of partitioning, all requests for authorization for partial assignment of a license must include, as an attachment, a description of the partitioned service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 degrees along the partitioned service area unless an FCC-recognized service area is utilized (e.g., Metropolitan Service Area, Rural Service Area, or Economic Area) or county lines are used. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In a case where an FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that constitute the partitioned area.

        (2)  VHF (156-162 MHz) spectrum may only be disaggregated according to frequency pairs. AMTS spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.

        (3)  The Commission will consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.

        (c)  The license term for a partitioned license area and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original licensee's term as provided for in § 80.25 of this part.

        (d)  Parties seeking to acquire a partitioned license or disaggregated spectrum from a site-based AMTS, or nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF public coast licensee will be required to construct and commence “service to subscribers” in all facilities acquired through such transactions within the original construction deadline for each facility as set forth in § 80.49. Failure to meet the individual construction deadline will result in the automatic termination of the facility's authorization.

#### § § 80.100

          The code employed for telegraphy must be the Morse code specified in the Telegraph Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention. Pertinent extracts from the Telegraph Regulations are contained in the “Manual for Use by the Maritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile-Satellite Services” published by the International Telecommunication Union.

          § 80.101   Radiotelephone testing procedures.

#### § § 80.101

          This section is applicable to all stations using telephony except where otherwise specified.

          (a) Station licensees must not cause harmful interference. When radiation is necessary or unavoidable, the testing procedure described below must be followed:

          (1) The operator must not interfere with transmissions in progress.

          (2) The testing station's call sign, followed by the word “test”, must be announced on the radio-channel being used for the test.

          (3) If any station responds “wait”, the test must be suspended for a minimum of 30 seconds, then repeat the call sign followed by the word “test” and listen again for a response. To continue the test, the operator must use counts or phrases which do not conflict with normal operating signals, and must end with the station's call sign. Test signals must not exceed ten seconds, and must not be repeated until at least one minute has elapsed. On the frequency 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz, the time between tests must be a minimum of five minutes.

          (b) Testing of transmitters must be confined to single frequency channels on working frequencies. However, 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz may be used to contact ship or coast stations as appropriate when signal reports are necessary. Short tests on 4125 kHz are permitted by vessels equipped with MF/HF radios to evaluate the compatibility of the equipment for distress and safety purposes. U.S. Coast Guard stations may be contacted on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz for test purposes only when tests are being conducted by Commission employees, when FCC-licensed technicians are conducting inspections on behalf of the Commission, when qualified technicians are installing or repairing radiotelephone equipment, or when qualified ship's personnel conduct an operational check requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. In these cases the test must be identified as “FCC” or “technical.”

          (c) Survival craft transmitter tests must not be made within actuating range of automatic alarm receivers.

          § 80.102   Radiotelephone station identification.

#### § § 80.102

          This section applies to all stations using telephony which are subject to this part.

          (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, stations must give the call sign in English. Identification must be made:

          (1) At the beginning and end of each communication with any other station.

          (2) At 15 minute intervals when transmission is sustained for more than 15 minutes. When public correspondence is being exchanged with a ship or aircraft station, the identification may be deferred until the completion of the communications.

          (b) Private coast stations located at drawbridges and transmitting on the navigation frequency 156.650 MHz may identify by use of the name of the bridge in lieu of the call sign.

          (c) Ship stations transmitting on any authorized VHF bridge-to-bridge channel may be identified by the name of the ship in lieu of the call sign.

          (d) Ship stations operating in a vessel traffic service system or on a waterway under the control of a U.S. Government agency or a foreign authoriy, when communicating with such an agency or authority may be identified by the name of the ship in lieu of the call sign, or as directed by the agency or foreign authority.

          (e) Voice traffic in the INMARSAT system is closed to other parties except the two stations involved and the identification is done automatically with the establishment of the call. Therefore, it is not necessary for these stations to identify themselves periodically during the communication. For terrestrial systems using DSC to establish radiotelephone communications, the identification is made at the beginning of the call. In these cases, both parties must identify themselves by ship name, call sign or MMSI at least once every 15 minutes during radiotelephone communications.

          (f) VHF public coast stations licensed to serve a predetermined geographic service area are not required to provide station identification under this section. A site-based VHF public coast station may identify by means of the approximate geographic location of the station or the area it serves when it is the only VHF public coast station serving the location or there will be no conflict with the identification of any other station.

          This section applies to all coast stations using telephony which are subject to this part.

          (a)  (1) Except when transmitting a general call to all stations for announcing or preceding the transmission of distress, urgency, or safety messages, a coast station must call the particular station(s) with which it intends to communicate.

          (2) Coast stations must call ship stations by voice unless it is known that the particular ship station may be contacted by other means such as automatic actuation of a selective ringing or calling device.

          (3) Coast stations may be authorized emission for selective calling on each working frequency.

          (4) Calling a particular station must not continue for more than one minute in each instance. If the called station does not reply, that station must not again be called for two minutes. When a called station does not reply to a call sent three times at intervals of two minutes, the calling must cease for fifteen minutes. However, if harmful interference will not be caused to other communications in progress, the call may be repeated after three minutes.

          (5) A coast station must not attempt to communicate with a ship station that has specifically called another coast station until it becomes evident that the called station does not answer, or that communication between the ship station and the called station cannot be carried on because of unsatisfactory operating conditions.

          (6) Calls to establish communication must be initiated on an available common working frequency when such a frequency exists and it is known that the called ship maintains a simultaneous watch on the common working frequency and the appropriate calling frequency(ies).

          (b)  Transmissions by coast stations on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz must be minimized and any one exchange of communications must not exceed one minute in duration.

          (c)  After establishing communications with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz coast stations must change to an authorized working channel for the transmission of messages.

          (d)  A coast station, when communicating with a ship station which transmits to the coast station on a radio channel which is a different channel from that used by the coast station for transmission, may transmit a “busy” signal whenever transmission from the ship station is being received. The characteristics of the “busy” signal are contained in § 80.74.

          § 80.114   Authority of the master.

#### § § 80.114

          (a) The service of each ship station must at all times be under the ultimate control of the master, who must require that each operator or such station comply with the Radio Regulations in force and that the ship station is used in accordance with those regulations.

          (b) These rules are waived when the vessel is under the control of the U.S. Government.

          § 80.115   Operational conditions for use of associated ship units.

#### § § 80.115

          (a) Associated ship units may be operated under a ship station authorization. Use of an associated ship unit is restricted as follows;

          (1) It must only be operated on the safety and calling frequency 156.800 MHz or 156.525 MHz or on commercial or noncommercial VHF intership frequencies appropriate to the class of ship station with which it is associated.

          (2) Except for safety purposes, it must only be used to communicate with the ship station with which it is associated or with associated ship units of the same ship station. Such associated ship units may be used from shore only adjacent to the waterway (such as on a dock or beach) where the ship is located. Communications from shore must relate to the operational and business needs of the ship including the transmission of safety information, and must be limited to the minimum practicable transmission time.

          (3) It must be equipped to transmit on the frequency 156.800 MHz or 156.525 MHz and at least one appropriate intership frequency.

          (4) Calling must occur on the frequency 156.800 MHz or 156.525 MHz unless calling and working on an intership frequency has been prearranged.

          (5) Power is limited to one watt.

          (6) The station must be identified by the call sign of the ship station with which it is associated and an appropriate unit designator.

          (b) State or local government vehicles used to tow vessels involved in search and rescue operations are authorized to operate on maritime mobile frequencies as associated ship units. Such operations must be in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, except that the associated ship unit: May be operated from shore; may use Distress, Safety and Calling, Intership Safety, Liaison, U.S. Coast Guard, or Maritime Control VHF intership frequencies; and may have a transmitter power of 25 watts.

          § 80.116   Radiotelephone operating procedures for ship stations.

#### § § 80.116

          (a)  (1) Use by ship stations of the frequency 2182 kHz for calling coast stations and for replying to calls from coast stations is authorized. However, such calls and replies should be on the appropriate ship-shore working frequency.

          (2) Use by ship stations and marine utility stations of the frequency 156.800 MHz for calling coast stations and marine utility stations on shore, and for replying to calls from such stations, is authorized. However, such calls and replies should be made on the appropriate ship-shore working frequency.

          (b)  (1) Except when other operating procedure is used to expedite safety communication, ship stations, before transmitting on the intership working frequencies 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz, must first establish communications with other ship stations by call and reply on 2182 kHz. Calls may be initiated on an intership working frequency when it is known that the called vessel maintains a simultaneous watch on the working frequency and on 2182 kHz.

          (2) Except when other operating procedures are used to expedite safety communications, the frequency 156.800 MHz must be used for call and reply by ship stations and marine utility stations before establishing communication on one of the intership working frequencies. Calls may be initiated on an intership working frequency when it is known that the called vessel maintains a simultaneous watch on the working frequency and on 156.800 MHz.

          (c)  After establishing communication with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz stations on board ship must change to an authorized working frequency for the transmission of messages.

          (d)  Calling a particular station must not continue for more than 30 seconds in each instance. If the called station does not reply, the station must not again be called until after an interval of 2 minutes. When a called station called does not reply to a call sent three times at intervals of 2 minutes, the calling must cease and must not be renewed until after an interval of 15 minutes; however, if there is no reason to believe that harmful interference will be caused to other communications in progress, the call sent three times at intervals of 2 minutes may be repeated after a pause of not less than 3 minutes. In event of an emergency involving safety, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply.

          (e)  Any one exchange of communications between any two ship stations on 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz or between a ship station and a private coast station on 2738 or 2830 kHz must not exceed 3 minutes after the stations have established contact. Subsequent to such exchange of communications, the same two stations must not again use 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz for communication with each other until 10 minutes have elapsed.

          (f)  To facilitate the reception of distress calls, all transmissions on 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz (channel 16) must be minimized and transmissions on 156.800 MHz must not exceed 1 minute.

          (g)  On frequencies in the band 156-162 MHz, the exchange of commercial communication must be limited to the minimum practicable transmission time. In the conduct of ship-shore communication other than distress, stations on board ship must comply with instructions given by the private coast station or marine utility station on shore with which they are communicating.

        § 80.213   Modulation requirements.

#### § § 80.213

        (a) Transmitters must meet the following modulation requirements:

        (1) When double sideband emission is used the peak modulation must be maintained between 75 and 100 percent;

        (2) When phase or frequency modulation is used in the 156-162 MHz band the peak modulation must be maintained between 75 and 100 percent. A frequency deviation of ±5 kHz is defined as 100 percent peak modulation; and

        (3) In single sideband operation the upper sideband must be transmitted. Single sideband transmitters must automatically limit the peak envelope power to their authorized operating power and meet the requirements in § 80.207(c).

        (b) Radiotelephone transmitters using A3E, F3E and G3E emission must have a modulation limiter to prevent any modulation over 100 percent. This requirement does not apply to survival craft transmitters, to transmitters that do not require a license or to transmitters whose output power does not exceed 3 watts.

        (c) Coast station transmitters operated in the 72.0-73.0 MHz and 75.4-76.0 MHz bands must be equipped with an audio low-pass filter. The filter must be installed between the modulation limiter and the modulated radio frequency stage. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 15 kHz it must have an attenuation greater than at 1 kHz by at least 40log (f/3) dB where “f” is the frequency in kilohertz. At frequencies above 15 kHz the attenuation must be at least 28 dB greater than at 1 kHz.

        (d) Ship and coast station transmitters operating in the 156-162 MHz and 216-220 bands must be capable of proper operation with a frequency deviation that does not exceed ±5 kHz when using any emission authorized by § 80.207.

The filter must be installed between the modulation limiter and the modulated radio frequency stage. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 20 kHz it must have an attenuation greater than at 1 kHz by at least 60log(f/3) dB where “f” is the audio frequency in kilohertz. At frequencies above 20 kHz the attenuation must be at least 50 dB greater than at 1 kHz.

        (f) Radiodetermination ship stations operating on 154.585 MHz, 159.480 MHz, 160.725 MHz, 160.785 MHz, 454.000 MHz and 459.000 MHz must employ a duty cycle with a maximum transmission period of 60 seconds followed by a minimum quiescent period four times the duration of the transmission period.

        (g) Radar stations operating in the bands above 2.4 GHz may use any type of modulation consistent with the bandwidth requirements in § 80.209(b).

        (h) Radar transponder coast stations using the 2900-3100 MHz or 9300-9500 MHz band must operate in a variable frequency mode and respond on their operating frequencies with a maximum error equivalent to 100 meters. Additionally, their response must be encoded with a Morse character starting with a dash. The duration of a Morse dot is defined as equal to the width of a space and   of the width of a Morse dash. The duration of the response code must not exceed 50 microseconds. The sensitivity of the stations must be adjustable so that received signals below −10 dBm at the antenna will not activate the transponder. Antenna polarization must be horizontal when operating in the 9300-9500 MHz band and either horizontal or both horizontal and vertical when operating in the 2900-3100 MHz band. Racons using frequency agile transmitting techniques must include circuitry designed to reduce interference caused by triggering from radar antenna sidelobes.

        (i) Variable frequency ship station transponders operating in the 2900-3100 MHz or 9300-9500 MHz band that are not used for search and rescue purposes must meet the following requirements:

        (1) Non-selectable transponders must have the following characteristics:

        (i) They must respond on all their frequencies with a maximum range error equivalent to 100 meters;

        (ii) They must use a Morse encoding of “PS” (dot-dash-dash-dot, dot-dot-dot), meaning “You should not come any closer”. The width of a Morse dot is defined as equal to the width of a space and   of the width of a Morse dash;

        (iii) When they employ swept frequency techniques they must not transmit on any frequency for more than 10 seconds in any 120 second period;

        (iv) Any range offset of their response must occur during their pause on the fixed frequency;

        (v) The duration of the response code must not exceed 50 microseconds;

        (vi) The sensitivity of the stations must be adjustable so that received signals below −10 dBm at the antenna input will not activate the transponder;

        (vii) Antenna polarization must be horizontal when operating in the 9300-9500 MHz band and either horizontal or both horizontal and vertical when operating in the 2900-3100 MHz band.

        (viii) Transponders using frequency agile techniques must include circuitry designed to reduce interference caused by triggering from radar antenna sidelobes.

        (2) Selectable transponders must be authorized under part 5 of the Commission's rules until standards for their use are developed.

This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system as required or recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard, when an efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-bridge frequency and a separate assigned VTS frequency.

          (b) Each cargo ship of the United States which is equipped with a radiotelephone station for compliance with part II of title III of the Communications Act or chapter IV of the Safety Convention must while being navigated outside of a harbor or port:

          (1) If it is not carrying MF-DSC radio equipment, keep a continuous watch on 2182 kHz in the room from which the vessel is normally steered while at sea, whenever such station is not being used for authorized traffic. Such watch must be maintained by at least one officer or crewmember who may perform other duties relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere with the watch.

          (2) Keep a continuous watch on 156.800 MHz from the room from which the vessel is normally steered. The watch must be maintained by a crewmember who may perform other duties, relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere with the watch. Use of properly adjusted squelch of brief interruptions due to other nearby VHF transmissions are not considered to adversely affect the watch. This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system when a watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.

          (c) Each vessel of the United States transporting more than six passengers for hire, which is equipped with a radiotelephone station for compliance with 47 U.S.C. 381-386 but which is not carrying MF-DSC radio equipment, must, while being navigated in the open sea or any tidewater within the jurisdiction of the United States adjacent or contiguous to the open sea, keep a continuous watch on 2182 kHz while the vessel is beyond VHF communication range of the nearest VHF coast station, whenever the radiotelephone station is not being used for authorized traffic. A VHF watch must be kept on 156.800 MHz whenever such station is not being used for authorized traffic. The VHF watch must be maintained at the vessel's steering station actually in use by the qualified operator as defined by § 80.157 or by a crewmember who may perform other duties relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere with the watch. The use of a properly adjusted squelch is not considered to adversely affect the watch. The VHF watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system when an efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.

          § 80.307   Compulsory use of radiotelegraph auto alarm.

#### § § 80.307

          The radiotelegraph auto alarm required on a cargo ship subject to the radiotelegraph provisions of part II of title III of the Communications Act or the Safety Convention must be in operation, connected to the main antenna and adjusted for optimum efficiency at all times while the ship is being navigated in the open sea when a radio officer is not listening on the frequency 500 kHz, except under the circumstances as set forth in § 80.306(b).

          § 80.308   Watch required for subpart T vessels on the Great Lakes.

#### § § 80.308

          (a) Each ship of the United States that is equipped with a radiotelephone station for compliance with subpart T of this part must when underway keep a watch on:

          (1) 156.800 MHz on board a vessel 20 meters (65 feet) _and_ over in length, a vessel engaged in towing (See § 80.951(b)), or a vessel carrying more than 6 passengers for hire. This watch must be maintained whenever the station is not being used for authorized traffic. However, a watch on 156.800 MHz need not be maintained by a vessel maintaining a watch on the bridge-to-bridge frequency 156.650 MHz  participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system and maintaining a watch on the specified VTS frequency.

          (2) 156.650 MHz on board a vessel 38 meters (124 feet) and over in length, a vessel engaged in towing (See § 80.951(b)), or a vessel carrying more than six passengers for hire. This watch must be maintained continuously and effectively. Sequential monitoring is not sufficient. Portable VHF equipment may be used to meet this requirement. Vessels are exempted from this requirement while transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway and complying with the Joint Regulations of the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority and St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation between the lower exit of St. Lambert Lock at Montreal and Crossover Island, New York and in the Welland Canal and approaches between Calling in Point No. 15 and No. 16.

          (b) The watch must be maintained by the master, or person designated by the master, who may perform other duties provided they do not interfere with the effectiveness of the watch.

          § 80.310   Watch required by voluntary vessels.

#### § § 80.310

          Voluntary vessels not equipped with DSC must maintain a watch on 2182 kHz and on 156.800 MHz (Channel 16) whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate. Noncommercial vessels, such as recreational boats, may alternatively maintain a watch on 156.450 MHz (Channel 9) in lieu of VHF Channel 16 for call and reply purposes. Voluntary vessels equipped with VHF-DSC equipment must maintain a watch on 2182 kHz and on either 156.525 MHz (Channel 70) or VHF Channel 16 aurally whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate. Voluntary vessels equipped with MF-HF DSC equipment must have the radio turned on and set to an appropriate DSC distress calling channel or one of the radiotelephone distress channels whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate. Voluntary vessels equipped with a GMDSS-approved Inmarsat system must have the unit turned on and set to receive calls whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate.

        Distress, Alarm, Urgency and Safety Procedures

          § 80.311   Authority for distress transmission.

#### § § 80.311

          A mobile station in distress may use any means at its disposal to attract attention, make known its position, and obtain help. A distress call and message, however, must be transmitted only on the authority of the master or person responsible for the mobile station. No person shall knowingly transmit, or cause to be transmitted, any false or fraudulent signal of distress or related communication.

          § 80.312   Priority of distress transmissions.

#### § § 80.312

          The distress call has absolute priority over all other transmissions. All stations which hear it must immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with the distress traffic and must continue to listen on the frequency used for the emission of the distress call. This call must not be addressed to a particular station. Acknowledgement of receipt must not be given before the distress message which follows it is sent.

          § 80.313   Frequencies for use in distress.

#### § § 80.313

          The frequencies specified in the bands below are for use by mobile stations in distress. The conventional emission is shown. When a ship station cannot transmit on the designated frequency or the conventional emission, it may use any available frequency or emission. Frequencies for distress and safety calling using digital selective calling techniques are listed in § 80.359(b). Distress and safety NB-DP frequencies are indicated by footnote 2 in § 80.361(b).

          The maximum transmitter power obtainable may be used.

          § 80.314   Distress communications.

#### § § 80.314

          (a) The international radiotelephone distress signal consists of the word MAYDAY, pronounced as the French expression “m'aider”.

          (b) These distress signals indicate that a mobile station is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requests immediate assistance.

          (c) The radiotelephone distress call consists of:

          (1) The distress signal MAYDAY spoken three times;

          (2) The words THIS IS;

          (3) The call sign (or name, if no call sign assigned) of the mobile station in distress, spoken three times;

          (4) Particulars of the station's position;

          (5) The nature of the distress;

          (6) The kind of assistance desired; and

          (7) Any other information which might facilitate rescue, for example, the length, color, and type of vessel, or number of persons on board.

          (d) The procedures for canceling false distress alerts are contained in § 80.335.

> [51 FR 31213, Sept. 2, 1986, as amended at 68 FR 46968, Aug. 7, 2003; 73 FR 4485, Jan. 25, 2008]

          § 80.317   Radiotelegraph and radiotelephone alarm signals.

#### § § 80.317

          (a) The international radiotelegraph alarm signal consists of a series of twelve dashes sent in one minute, the duration of each dash being four seconds and the duration of the interval between consecutive dashes one second. The purpose of this special signal is the actuation of automatic devices giving the alarm to attract the attention of the operator when there is no listening watch on the distress frequency.

          (b) The international radiotelephone alarm signal consists of two substantially sinusoidal audio frequency tones transmitted alternately. One tone must have a frequency of 2200 Hertz and the other a frequency of 1300 Hertz, the duration of each tone being 250 milliseconds. When generated by automatic means, the radiotelephone alarm signal must be transmitted continuously for a period of at least 30 seconds, but not exceeding one minute; when generated by other means, the signal must be transmitted as continuously as practicable over a period of approximately one minute. The purpose of this special signal is to attract the attention of the person on watch or to actuate automatic devices giving the alarm.

          § 80.318   Use of alarm signals.

#### § § 80.318

          (a) The radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal, as appropriate, must only be used to announce:

          (1) That a distress call or message is about to follow;

          (2) The transmission of an urgent cyclone warning. In this case the alarm signal may only be used by coast stations authorized by the Commission to do so; or

          (3) The loss of a person or persons overboard. In this case the alarm signal may only be used when the assistance of other ships is required and cannot be satisfactorily obtained by the use of the urgency signal only, but the alarm signal must not be repeated by other stations. The message must be preceded by the urgency signal.

          (b) In cases described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, the transmission of the warning or message by radiotelegraphy must not begin until two minutes after the end of the radiotelegraph alarm signal.

          § 80.319   Radiotelegraph distress call and message transmission procedure.

#### § § 80.319

          (a) The radiotelegraph distress procedure consists of the following six steps: however, when time is vital, the first and second steps may be omitted. These two steps of the distress procedure may also be omitted in circumstances when transmission of the alarm signal is considered unnecessary:

          (1) The radiotelegraph alarm signal;

          (2) The distress call and an interval of two minutes;

          (3) The distress call;

          (4) The distress message;

          (5) Two dashes of ten to fifteen seconds each;

          (6) The call sign of the mobile station in distress.

          (b) The radiotelegraph distress transmissions must be sent by means of the international Morse code at a speed not exceeding 16 words per minute nor less than 8 words per minute.

          (c) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be repeated at intervals until an answer is received. The radiotelegraph alarm signal may also be repeated, if necessary.

          (d) The transmissions under paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this section, which are to permit direction finding stations to determine the position of the station in distress, may be repeated at frequent intervals if necessary.

          (e) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a distress message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may be repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.

          § 80.320   Radiotelephone distress call and message transmission procedure.

#### § § 80.320

          (a) The radiotelephone distress procedure consists of:

          (1) The radiotelephone alarm signal (whenever possible);

          (2) The distress call;

          (3) The distress message.

          (b) The DSC distress procedure consists of:

          (1) Transmission by a mobile unit in distress;

          (2) Reception;

          (3) Acknowledgement of distress calls;

          (4) Distress relays.

          (c) Radiotelephone distress transmissions must be made slowly and distinctly, each word being clearly pronounced to facilitate transcription.

          (d) After the transmission by radiotelephony of its distress message, the mobile station may be requested to transmit suitable signals followed by its call sign or name, to permit direction-finding stations to determine its position. This request may be repeated at frequent intervals if necessary.

          (e) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be repeated at intervals until an answer is received. This repetition must be preceded by the radiotelephone alarm signal whenever possible.

          (f) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a distress message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may be repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.

          § 80.321   Acknowledgement of receipt of distress message.

#### § § 80.321

          (a) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress message from a mobile station which is beyond any possible doubt in their vicinity must immediately acknowledge receipt. However, in areas where reliable communication with one or more coast stations is practicable, ship stations may defer this acknowledgement for a short interval so that a coast station may acknowledge receipt.

          (b) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress message from a mobile station which beyond any possible doubt is not in their vicinity, must allow a short interval of time to elapse before acknowledging receipt of the message in order to permit stations nearer to the mobile station in distress to acknowledge receipt without interference.

          § 80.322   Form of acknowledgement.

#### § § 80.322

          (a) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelegraph distress message is transmitted in the following form:

          (1) The distress signal SOS;

          (2) The call sign of the station sending the distress message, sent three times;

          (3) The word DE;

          (4) The call sign of the station acknowledging receipt, sent three times;

          (5) The group RRR;

          (6) The message signal SOS.

          (b) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelephone distress message is transmitted in the following form:

          (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;

          (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the distress message, spoken three times;

          (3) The words THIS IS;

          (4) The call sign or other identification of the station acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;

          (5) The word RECEIVED;

          (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.

          § 80.323   Information furnished by an acknowledging station.

#### § § 80.323

          (a) Every mobile station which acknowledges receipt of a distress message must on the order of the master or person responsible for the ship, aircraft, or other vehicle carrying such mobile station, transmit as soon as possible the following information in the order shown:

          (1) Its identifier;

          (2) Its position;

          (3) The speed at which it is proceeding towards, and the approximate time it will take to reach the mobile station in distress.

          (b) Before sending this message, the station must ensure that it will not interfere with the emissions of other stations better situated to render immediate assistance to the station in distress.

          § 80.324   Transmission of distress message by station not itself in distress.

#### § § 80.324

          (a) A mobile station or a land station which learns that a mobile station is in distress must transmit a distress message in any of the following cases:

          (1) When the station in distress cannot transmit the distress message.

          (2) When the master or person responsible for the ship, aircraft, or other vehicle not in distress, or for the land station, believes that further help is necessary.

          (3) When, although not in a position to assist, it has heard a distress message which has not been acknowledged. When a mobile station transmits such a distress message, it must notify the authorities who may be able to assist.

          (b) Transmission must be made on the international distress frequencies or on any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.

          (c) Transmission of the distress message must always be preceded by the call indicated below, which must itself be preceded whenever possible by the radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal. This call consists of:

          (1) When radiotelegraphy is used:

          (i) The signal DDD SOS SOS SOS DDD:

          (ii) The word DE;

          (iii) The call sign of the transmitting station, sent three times.

          (iii) The call sign or other identification of the transmitting station, spoken three times.

          (d) When the radiotelegraph alarm signal is used, an interval of two minutes must be allowed, whenever this is considered necessary, before the transmission of the call mentioned in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

          § 80.325   Control of distress traffic.

#### § § 80.325

          (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the immediate assistance required by the mobile station in distress. In distress traffic, the distress signal must be sent before the call and at the beginning of the preamble of any radiotelegram.

          (b) The control of distress traffic is the responsibility of the mobile station in distress or of the station which has sent the distress message. These stations may delegate the control of the distress traffic to another station.

          (c) The station in distress or the station in control of distress traffic may impose silence either on all stations of the mobile service in the area or on any station which interferes with the distress traffic. It must address these instructions “to all stations” or to one station only, according to circumstances. In either case, it must use one of the following signals which are reserved for use by the mobile station in distress and for the station controlling distress traffic:

          (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the distress signal SOS.

          (2) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY.

          (d) If essential, any station of the mobile service near the ship, aircraft, or other vehicle in distress may also impose silence. It must use for this purpose:

          (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the word DISTRESS and its own call sign;

          (2) In radiotelephony, the word SEELONCE, followed by the word DISTRESS and its own call sign or other identification.

          § 80.326   Notification of resumption of normal working.

#### § § 80.326

          (a) When distress traffic has ceased, or when complete silence is no longer necessary on a frequency which has been used for distress traffic, the station which has controlled this traffic must transmit on that frequency a message addressed “to all stations” indicating that normal working may be resumed.

          (1) In radiotelegraphy, this message consists of:

          (i) The distress signal SOS;

          (ii) The call “to all stations” (CQ), sent three times;

          (iii) The word DE;

          (iv) The call sign of the station sending the message;

          (v) The time of handing in the message;

          (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;

          (vii) The service abbreviation QUM.

          (2) In radiotelephony, this message consists of:

          (i) The distress signal MAYDAY;

          (ii) The call “Hello all stations”, spoken three times;

          (iii) The words THIS IS;

          (iv) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;

          (v) The time of handing in of the message;

          (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;

          (vii) The words SEELONCE FEENEE OR PRU-DONCE.

          (b) Until they receive the foregoing message indicating that normal or limited working may be resumed, all stations which are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, are forbidden to transmit on the frequencies on which the distress traffic is taking place.

          § 80.327   Urgency signals and messages.

#### § § 80.327

          (a) The urgency signal indicates that the calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship, aircraft, or other vehicle, or the safety of a person. The urgency signal must be sent only on the authority of the master or person responsible for the mobile station.

          (b) In radiotelegraphy, the urgency signal consists of three repetitions of the group XXX, sent with the individual letters of each group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It must be transmitted before the call.

          (c) In radiotelephony, the urgency signal consists of three oral repetitions of the group of words PAN PAN transmitted before the call.

          (d) The urgency signal has priority over all other communications except distress. All mobile and land stations which hear it must not interfere with the transmission of the message which follows the urgency signal.

          (e) The urgency signal and call, and the message following it, must be sent on one of the international distress frequencies. Stations which cannot transmit on a distress frequency may use any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.

          (f) Mobile stations which hear the urgency signal must continue to listen for at least three minutes. At the end of this period, if no urgency message has been heard, they may resume their normal service. However, land and mobile stations which are in communication on frequencies other than those used for the transmission of the urgency signal and of the call which follows it may continue their normal work without interruption provided the urgency message is not addressed “to all stations”.

          (g) When the urgency signal has been sent before transmitting a message “to all stations” which calls for action by the stations receiving the message, the station responsible for its transmission must cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no longer necessary. This message of cancellation must likewise be addressed “to all stations”.

          § 80.329   Safety signals and messages.

#### § § 80.329

          (a) The safety signal indicates that the station is about to transmit a message concerning the safety of navigation or giving important meteorological warnings.

          (b) In radiotelegraphy, the safety signal consists of three repetitions of the group TTT, sent with the individual letters of each group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It must be sent before the call.

          (c) In radiotelephony, the safety signal consists of the word SECURITE, pronounced as in French, spoken three times and transmitted before the call.

          (d) The safety signal and call must be sent on one of the international distress frequencies (2182 kHz or 156.8 MHz radiotelephone). Stations which cannot transmit on a distress frequency may use any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.

          (e) The safety signal and call must be followed by the safety message. Where practicable, the safety message should be sent on a working frequency, and a suitable announcement to this effect must be made at the end of the call.

          (f) Messages about meteorological warnings, of cyclones, dangerous ice, dangerous wrecks, or any other imminent danger to marine navigation must be preceded by the safety signal.

          (g) Stations hearing the safety signal must not make any transmission likely to interfere with the message.

#### § § 80.353

          § 80.355   Distress, urgency, safety, call and reply Morse code frequencies.

#### § § 80.355

          This section describes the distress, urgency, safety, call and reply carrier frequencies assignable to stations for Morse code radiotelegraphy.

          (a)  The international calling frequency in the 100-160 kHz band is 143 kHz using A1A or J2A emission. When a ship station operating in the 100-160 kHz band desires to communicate with a coast station, it must call on the frequency 143 kHz unless the International List of Coast Stations provides otherwise. Coast stations must reply on their normal working frequency in this band. Only individual calls, replies to such calls, and transmission of signals preparatory to traffic may be transmitted on 143 kHz.

          (b) —(1)  The following table describes the calling frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band which are available for use by authorized ship stations equipped with crystal-controlled oscillators for A1A, J2A, J2B, or J2D radiotelegraphy. There are two series of frequencies for worldwide use and two series of frequencies for each geographic region. Ship stations with synthesized transmitters may operate on every full 100 Hz increment in the 0.5 kHz channel for the frequencies listed, except for 100 Hz above and below those designated for worldwide use. During normal business hours when not communicating on other frequencies, all U.S. coast radiotelegraph stations must monitor the worldwide frequencies and the initial calling frequencies for the region in which it is located. The specific frequencies which must be monitored by a coast station will vary with propagation conditions. The calling frequencies which are routinely monitored by specific coast stations can be determined by reference to the ITU publication entitled “List of Coast Stations.” Initial calls by ship stations must be made on the appropriate initial calling frequency first. Calls on the worldwide frequencies may be made only after calls on the appropriate initial calling frequency are unsuccessful.

          (2)  Coast stations may use any working carrier frequency for distress, safety and calling listed in § 80.357(b)(1) which is not identified with a specific use.

          (c)  (1) Survival craft stations using 121.500 MHz may be assigned A3N emission for radiobeacon purposes.

          (2) EPIRB stations may be assigned 121.500 MHz and 243 MHz using A3E, A3X and NON emission or 406.0-406.1 MHz using G1D emission to aid search and rescue operations. See subpart V of this part.

          (a) —(1)  The following table describes the working carrier frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band which are assignable to ship stations. A ship station may also transmit on a radiotelegraphy working channel of a coast station within the 100-160 kHz band when directed to do so by the coast station provided interference is not caused to any land, fixed, broadcast, or radiolocation station.

          (2)  The following table describes the working carrier frequencies in the 405-525 kHz band which are assignable to ship stations. A ship station may transmit on a radiotelegraphy working channel of a coast station in the 415-490 kHz band when directed to do so by the coast station.

          (3)  This paragraph describes the working frequencies and Channel Series in the 2000-27500 kHz band which are assignable to ship stations.

          (i) Two Channel Series will be assigned for routine use to each ship station. Frequencies from any other Channel Series may be used if the frequencies in the assigned Channel Series are not adequate for communications.

          (ii) If the frequencies listed in paragraph (3)(i) of this section are not adequate for communications, ship stations may use any of the non-paired narrow-band direct-printing frequencies listed in § 80.361(b) of this part for A1A or J2A radiotelegraphy.

          (b) —(1)  The following table describes the working carrier frequencies in the 100-27500 kHz band which are assignable to coast stations located in the designated geographical areas. The exclusive maritime mobile HF bands listed in the table contained in § 80.363(a)(2) of this chapter are also available for assignment to public coast stations for A1A, J2A, J2B, or J2D radiotelegraphy following coordination with government users.

          (2)  The following conditions are applicable to these frequencies:

          (i) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band are assignable to coast stations for high seas communications only;

          (ii) Frequencies above 5 MHz may be assigned primarily to stations serving the high seas and secondarily to stations serving inland waters of the United States, including the Great Lakes, under the condition that interference will not be caused to any coast station serving the high seas.

          (iii) The frequency 410 kHz may be used on a secondary basis for the transmission of radiodetermination information and for transmitting by radiotelegraph radiodetermination messages to direction-finding stations; and

          § 80.359   Frequencies for digital selective calling (DSC).

#### § § 80.359

          (a)  The following table describes the calling frequencies for use by authorized ship and coast stations for general purpose DSC. There are three series of paried frequencies. One series is for worldwide use; the other two series are for regional use. The “Series A” designation includes coast stations along, and ship stations in, the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The “Series B” designation includes stations in any remaining areas. Stations must initiate contact on the appropriate regional frequency depending upon the location of the called station and propagation conditions. Acknowledgement is made on the paired frequency. The worldwide frequencies may be used for international calling, if calls on the appropriate regional frequencies are unsuccessful, or the regional series does not contain the appropriate band (e.g., 2 MHz). During normal working hours, all public coast stations capable of DSC operations must monitor the worldwide and regional frequencies appropriate for its location. The specific frequencies to be monitored will vary with propagation conditions.

          (b)  The frequencies 2187.5 kHz, 4207.5 kHz, 6312.0 kHz, 8414.5 kHz, 12577.0 kHz, 16804.5 kHz and 156.525 MHz may be used for DSC by coast and ship stations on a simplex basis for distress and safety purposes, and may also be used for routine ship-to-ship communications provided that priority is accorded to distress and safety communications. The provisions and procedures for distress and safety calling are contained in ITU-R M.541-9 (incorporated by reference,  § 80.7), and § 80.103(c).

          (c)  Coast and ship stations may use DSC techniques for general calling purposes on their assigned working frequencies in the 2000-27500 kHz band and on those frequencies in the 156-162 MHz band which are allocated for maritime control, commercial, non-commercial and public correspondence communications.

          § 80.371   Public correspondence frequencies.

#### § § 80.371

          This section describes the radiotelephony working frequencies assignable to ship and public coast stations.

          (a)  The following table describes the working carrier frequency pairs in the 2000-4000 kHz band.

          (b)  This paragraph describes the working carrier frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band. With respect to frequencies that are assignable in more than one geographical area, once the frequency is assigned to one licensee, any subsequent license will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference basis with respect to the incumbent license's existing operation. If the first licensee later seeks authorization to operate in an additional geographic area, such authorization will be on a secondary, non-interference basis to other co-channel licensees.

          (1) The following table specifies the carrier frequencies available for assignment to public coast stations. The paired ship frequencies are available for use by authorized ship stations. The specific frequency assignment available to public coast stations for a particular geographic area is indicated by an “x” under the appropriate column. The allotment areas are in accordance with the “Standard Defined Areas” as identified in the International Radio Regulations, Appendix 25 Planning System, and indicated in the preface to the International Frequency List (IFL).

          (2) The following table specifies the non-paired carrier frequencies that are available for assignment to public coast stations for simplex operations. These frequencies are available for use by authorized ship stations for transmissions to coast stations (simplex operations). Assignments on these frequencies must accept interference. They are shared with government users and are considered “common use” frequencies under the international Radio Regulations. They cannot be notified for inclusion in the Master International Frequency Register, which provides stations with interference protection, but may be listed in the international List of Coast Stations. ( Radio Regulation No. 1220 and Recommendation 304.)

          (c)  (1)(i) The frequency pairs listed in this paragraph are available for assignment to public coast stations for communications with ship stations and units on land.

          (ii) Service areas in the marine VHF 156-162 MHz band are VHF Public Coast Service Areas (VPCSAs). As listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), VPCSAs are based on, and composed of one or more of, the U.S. Department of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs).  60 FR 13114 (March 10, 1995). In addition, the Commission shall treat Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Gulf of Mexico as EA-like areas, and has assigned them EA numbers 173-176, respectively. Maps of the EAs and VPCSAs are available for public inspection through the Federal Communications Commission's Reference Information Center, Tel: 1-888-225-5322. In addition to the EAs listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), each VPCSA also includes the adjacent waters under the jurisdiction of the United States. In VPCSAs 10-42, the working carrier frequency pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz (Channel 25) is not available for assignment under this part.

          (iii) Subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, each licensee may also operate on 12.5 kHz offset frequencies in areas where the licensee is authorized on both frequencies adjacent to the offset frequency, and in areas where the licensee on the other side of the offset frequency consents to the licensee's use of the adjacent offset frequency. Coordination with Canada is required for offset operations under any circumstance in which operations on either adjoining 25 kHz channel would require such coordination.  § 80.57 of this part.

          (2) Any recovered channel pairs will revert automatically to the holder of the VPCSA license within which such channels are included, except the channel pairs listed in the table in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

#### § § 80.385

          This section describes the carrier frequencies for the Automated Maritime Telecommunications System (AMTS) and for other automated multi-station systems.

          (a)  (1) The Automated Maritime Communications System (AMTS) is an automated maritime telecommunications system.

          (2) The following carrier frequencies are available for assignment to public coast stations for public correspondence communications with ship stations and units on land. AMTS operations must not cause harmful interference to the U.S. Navy SPASUR system which operates in the band 216.880-217.080 MHz.

          (3) As listed in the table in this paragraph (a)(3), AMTS Areas (AMTSAs) are based on, and composed of one or more of, the U.S Department of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs). See 60 FR 13114 (March 10, 1995). In addition, the Commission shall treat Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Gulf of Mexico as EA-like areas. The Gulf of Mexico EA extends from 12 nautical miles off the United States Gulf coast outward into the Gulf. See § 27.6(a)(2) of this chapter and 62 FR 9636. Maps of the EAs and AMTSAs are available for public inspection through the Federal Communications Commission's Reference Information Center. These maps and data are also available on the FCC website at    These maps and data are also available on the FCC Web site at  The Group A and B frequency pairs listed in the table in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are available for assignment to a single licensee in each of the AMTSAs listed in the table in this paragraph (a)(3). In addition to the listed EAs listed in the table in this paragraph (a)(3), each AMTSA also includes the adjacent waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.

          (4) Channels in the 219-220 MHz band are also used on a secondary, non-interference basis by amateur stations participating in digital message forwarding systems. Amateur stations may not cause harmful interference to AMTS operations and must accept any harmful interference from AMTS operation. Amateur stations within 80 km (50 miles) of an AMTS coast station must obtain written approval from the AMTS licensee prior to operating in the 219-220 MHz band. Amateur stations within 640 km (398 miles) of an AMTS coast station must notify the AMTS licensee in writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in the 219-220 MHz band. All amateur stations must notify the American Radio Relay League in writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in the 219-220 MHz band (ARRL, 225 Main St., Newington, CT 06111-1494).

          (b) Subject to the requirements of § 1.924 of this chapter, §§ 80.215(h), and 80.475(a), each AMTS geographic area licensee may place stations anywhere within its region without obtaining prior Commission approval provided:

          (1) The AMTS geographic area licensee must locate its stations at least 120 kilometers from the stations of co-channel site-based AMTS licensees. Shorter separations between such stations will be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis upon submission of a technical analysis indicating that at least 18 dB protection will be provided to a site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour. The site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction for antenna height differential. The 18 dB protection to the site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be calculated using the F(50, 10) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential.

        § 80.753   Signal strength requirements at the service area contour.

#### § § 80.753

        (a) The requirements for reception by a marine VHF shipboard receiver are satisfied if the field strength from the coast station, calculated in accordance with § 80.771 is at least + 17 dBu above one microvolt.

        (b) These field strengths, voltages and powers at the receiver input are equivalent:

        (1) −132 dBW (decibels referred to 1 watt).

        (2) 1.8 microvolts across 50 ohms.

        (3) + 17 dBu (decibels referred to 1 microvolt per meter).

        (4) 7 microvolts per meter.

        § 80.755   Applicability.

#### § § 80.755

        Applications for maritime frequencies in the 156-162 MHz band must include a map showing the proposed service area contour. The service area contour must be computed in accordance with the following procedures.

        § 80.757   Topographical data.

#### § § 80.757

        (a) In the preparation of profile graphs and in determining the location and height above sea level of the antenna site, the elevations or contour intervals must be taken from U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps, whichever is the latest, for all areas for which maps are available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the next best topographic information must be used. The maps used must include the principal area to be served. U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps may be obtained from the Eastern Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads Street, Arlington, VA 22202, for maps of areas east of the Mississippi River, including Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and from the Western Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Denver CO 80225, for maps of areas west of the Mississippi River, including Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, Guam and American Samoa. Sectional aeronautical charts are available from the Distribution Division, National Ocean Service, Riverdale, MD 20840.

        (b) In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer generated, using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file such as those available for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Geographic Information Center or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center. In case of dispute maps will be used to determine the correct value.

        § 80.759   Average terrain elevation.

#### § § 80.759

        (a)(1) Draw radials from the antenna site for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with true north. Any such radial which extends entirely over land from the antenna site to the point of + 17 dBu field strength need not be drawn.

        (2) If the distance from the antenna site to the point of + 17 dBu field strength between any of the 45 degrees radials would be less than the distances calculated along these radials, an additional radial between such adjacent radials must be plotted and calculations made in each case. Each additional radial must be that radial along which it appears by inspection that transmission loss would be greatest.

        (b) Draw a circle of 16 km (10 statute mile) radius using the antenna site as the center. Divide each radial into 320 meter (0.2 statute mile) increments inside the circumference to the 3.2 km (2 statute mile) point.

        (c) Calculate the height above sea level of each 320 meter (0.2 statute mile) division by interpolating the contour intervals of the map, and record the value.

        (d) Average the values by adding them and dividing by the number of readings along each radial.

        (e) Calculate the height above average terrain by averaging the values calculated for each radial.

        § 80.761   Conversion graphs.

#### § § 80.761

        The following graphs must be employed where conversion from one to the other of the indicated types of units is required.

        (a)  To convert effective radiated power in watts to dBk or to dBW, find the power in watts on the horizontal axis. Move vertically along the line representing the power to the diagonal line. Move horizontally from the diagonal to the right side to read dBW and to the left to read dBk.

        (b)  To convert microvolts across 50 ohms to received power in dBW, find the signal in microvolts on the horizontal axis. Move vertically to the diagonal line, then move right horizontally to read dBW.

        (c)  To convert received power in dBW to field intensity in dBu find the received power in dBW on the horizontal axis. Move vertically to the diagonal line, then move right horizontally to read dBu.

        § 80.763   Effective antenna height.

#### § § 80.763

        The effective height of the antenna is the vertical distance between the center of the radiating system above the mean sea level and the average terrain elevation.

        § 80.765   Effective radiated power.

#### § § 80.765

        Effective radiated power is used in computing the service area contour. The effective radiated power is derived from the transmitter output power, loss in the transmission system including duplexers, cavities, circulators, switches and filters, and the gain relative to a half-wave dipole of the antenna system.

        § 80.767   Propagation curve.

#### § § 80.767

        The propagation graph, § 80.767 Graph 1, must be used in computing the service area contour. The graph provides data for field strengths in dBu for an effective radiated power of 1 kW, over sea water, fresh water or land (smooth earth); transmitting antena heights of 4,800, 3,200, 1,600, 800, 400, 200, and 100 feet; based on a receiving antenna height of 9 meters (30 feet), for the 156-162 MHz band. The use of this is described in this section.

        (a) Calculate the effective radiated power of the coast station, Ps in dB referred to 1 kW (dBk), as follows:

        (b) Determine the antenna height. For antenna heights between the heights for which this graph is drawn, use linear interpolation; assume linear height-gain for antennas higher than 4,800 feet.

        (c) For receiver antenna heights lower than 9 meters (30 feet), assume that the field strength is the same as at 9 meters (30 feet).

        (d) Assume that propagation over fresh water or over land is the same as that over sea water.

        § 80.769   Shadow loss.

#### § § 80.769

        Where the transmission path is obstructed the received signal must be adjusted to include shadow loss. Attenuation due to shadowing must be taken from § 80.769 Graph 1, as follows:

        (a) Inspect the map(s) to determine if a hill(s) obstructs an imaginary line of sight (dashed line on illustrative profiles of § 80.769 Graph 1 from the average terrain elevation at the coast station antenna to the water level at the ship location. If average terrain elevation exceeds the actual ground elevation at the antenna site, the latter elevation must be used as the average terrain elevation.

        (b) If a hill appears to obstruct the radio path, plot the antenna site elevation, the obstruction elevation and the height of the ship station on rectangular coordinate paper using elevation above mean sea level as the vertical scale and distance in statute miles as the horizontal scale. Then draw a straight line between the antenna and the ship.

        (c) If a hill obstructs the imaginary line of sight, determine its height (H) above the imaginary line and its distance (D) from either the coast or ship station, whichever is nearer, as illustrated by examples “A” and “B” on Graph 1.

        (d) Read the shadow loss from this Graph 1 and subtract that loss from the computed received signal.

        (e) Where more than one hill obstructs the transmission path, determine the height and position of a single equivalent hill, as illustrated by example “C” on this graph. Read the shadow loss from this graph for the equivalent hill.

        § 80.771   Method of computing coverage.

#### § § 80.771

        Compute the + 17 dBu contour as follows:

        (a) Determine the effective antenna height above mean sea level according to the procedures in §§ 80.757-80.761.

        (b) Determine the effective radiated power according to § 80,765. Determine for each radial the distance from the antenna site to the + 17 dBu point of field strength using procedures of §§ 80.765 and 80.767.

        (c) Plot on a suitable map each point of + 17 dBu field strength for all radials and draw the contour by connecting the adjacent points by a smooth curve.

        § 80.773   Co-channel interference protection.

#### § § 80.773

        (a) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares a frequency with an incumbent VHF public coast station licensee, the ratio of desired to undesired signal strengths must be at least 12 dB within the service area of the station.

        (b) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares a frequency with an incumbent private land mobile radio licensee, the VHF public coast station geographic area licensee must provide at least 10 dB protection to the PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour. The PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour is calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential, and is based on the licensee's authorized effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain.

        (c) VHF public coast station geographic area licensees are prohibited from exceeding a field strength of + 5 dBu (decibels referenced to 1 microvolt per meter) at their service area boundaries, unless all the affected VHF public coast station geographic area licensees agree to the higher field strength.

          § 80.1099   Ship sources of energy.

#### § § 80.1099

          (a) There must be available at all times, while the ship is at sea, a supply of electrical energy sufficient to operate the radio installations and to charge any batteries used as part of a reserve source of energy for the radio installations.

          (b) A reserve source of energy to supply radio installations must be provided on every ship for the purpose of conducting distress and safety radiocommunications, in the event of failure of the ship's main and emergency sources of electrical power. The reserve sources of energy must be capable of simultaneously operating the VHF radio installation required by § 80.1085(a)(1) and, as appropriate for the sea area or sea areas for which the ship is equipped, either the MF radio installation required by § 80.1089(a)(1), the MF/HF radio installation required by § 80.1091(a)(2)(i) or § 80.1093(a), or the INMARSAT ship earth station required by § 80.1091(a)(1) and any of the additional loads mentioned in paragraphs (d), (e) and (h) of this section for a period of at least:

          (1) One hour, on ships constructed on or after February 1, 1995;

          (2) One hour, on ships constructed before February 1, 1995, if the emergency source of electrical power complies fully with all relevant requirements of SOLAS, Chapter II-1, Regulation 42 or 43 (as amended); or

          (3) Six hours, on ships constructed before February 1, 1995, and on cargo ships of less than 500 tons gross tonnage, if the emergency source of electrical power is not provided or does not comply fully with all relevant requirements of SOLAS, Chapter II-1, Regulation 42 or 43 (as amended).

          (c) The reserve sources of energy need not supply independent HF and MF radio installations at the same time. The reserve sources of energy must be independent of the propelling power of the ship and the ship's electrical system.

          (d) Where, in addition to the VHF radio installation, two or more of the other radio installations, referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, can be connected to the reserve sources of energy, they must be capable of simultaneously supplying, for one hour, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the VHF radio installation and;

          (1) All other radio installations which can be connected to the reserve sources of energy at the same time; or

          (2) Whichever of the other radio installations will consume the most power, if only one of the other radio installations can be connected to the reserve sources of energy at the same time as the VHF radio installation.

          (e) The reserve sources of energy may be used to supply the electrical lighting required by § 80.1083(b)(4).

          (f) Where a reserve source of energy consists of a rechargeable accumulator battery or batteries:

          (1) A means of automatically charging such batteries must be provided which must be capable of recharging them to minimum capacity requirements within 10 hours; and

          (2) Battery charge levels should be checked at intervals of 30 days or less with equipment turned ON and the battery charger turned OFF. Portable equipment with primary batteries such as EPIRBs and SARTs should be checked at the same intervals using methods recommended by the manufacturer. The results of battery checks should be recorded in the radio log.

          (g) The accumulator batteries which provide a reserve source of energy must be installed to ensure: The highest degree of service, a reasonable lifetime, reasonable safety; that the battery temperatures remain within the manufacturer's specifications whether under charge or idle; and that when fully charged, the batteries will provide at least the minimum required hours of operation under all weather conditions.

          (h) If an uninterrupted input of information from the ship's navigational or other equipment to a radio installation required by this subpart (including the navigational receiver referred to in SOLAS Chapter IV, Regulation 18) is needed to ensure its proper performance, means must be provided to ensure the continuous supply of such information in the event of failure of the ship's main or emergency source of electrical power.

          (i) An uninterruptible power supply or other means of ensuring a continuous supply of electrical power, within equipment tolerances, shall be provided to all GMDSS equipment that could be affected by normal variations and interruptions of ship's power.

        Operating Procedures for Distress and Safety Communications

          § 80.1109   Distress, urgency, and safety communications.

#### § § 80.1109

          (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the immediate assistance required by the ship in distress, including search and rescue communications and on-scene communications. Distress traffic must as far as possible be on the frequencies contained in § 80.1077.

          (b) Urgency and safety communications include: navigational and meteorological warnings and urgent information; ship-to-ship safety navigation communications; ship reporting communications; support communications for search and rescue operations; other urgency and safety messages and communications relating to the navigation, movements and needs of ships and weather observation messages destined for an official meteorological service.

          (c) Intership navigation safety communications are those VHF radiotelephone communications conducted between ships for the purpose of contributing to the safe movement of ships. The frequency 156.650 MHz is used for intership navigation safety communications (see § 80.1077).

          § 80.1111   Distress alerting.

#### § § 80.1111

          (a) The transmission of a distress alert indicates that a mobile unit or person is in distress and requires immediate assistance. The distress alert is a digital selective call using a distress call format in bands used for terrestrial radiocommunication or a distress message format, which is relayed through space stations.

          (b) The distress alert must be sent through a satellite either with absolute priority in general communication channels or on exclusive distress and safety frequencies or, alternatively, on the distress and safety frequencies in the MF, HF, and VHF bands using digital selective calling.

          (c) The distress alert must be sent only on the authority of the person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the mobile station or the mobile earth station.

          (d) All stations which receive a distress alert transmitted by digital selective calling must immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with distress traffic and must continue watch on the digital selective call distress calling channel until the call has been acknowledged to determine if a coast station acknowledges the call using digital selective calling. Additionally, the station receiving the distress alert must set watch on the associated distress traffic frequency for five minutes to determine if distress traffic takes place. The ship can acknowledge the call using voice or narrowband direct printing as appropriate on this channel to the ship or to the rescue authority.

          § 80.1113   Transmission of a distress alert.

#### § § 80.1113

          (a) The distress alert must identify the station in distress and its position. The distress alert may also contain information regarding the nature of the distress, the type of assistance required, the course and speed of the mobile unit, the time that this information was recorded and any other information which might facilitate rescue.

          (b) The format of distress calls and distress messages must be in accordance with ITU-R M.493-13 and ITU-R M.541-9 (both incorporated by reference,  § 80.7), as specified in § 80.1101.

          (c) Ship-to-shore distress alerts are used to alert Rescue Coordination Centers via coast stations or coast earth stations that a ship is in distress. These alerts are based on the use of transmissions via satellites (from a ship earth station or a satellite EPIRB) and terrestrial services (from ship stations and EPIRBs).

          (d) Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital selective calling in the VHF and MF bands. The HF bands should not be used to notify ships in the vicinity unless no response is received within five minutes on VHF or MF.

          (e) Shore-to-ship distress alert relays are used by a station or Rescue Coordination Center to relay information about a ship in distress to, as appropriate, all ships, a selected group of ships, or a specific ship by satellite and/or terrestrial means. The distress alert relay must contain the identification of the mobile unit in distress, its position and all other information which might facilitate rescue.

          § 80.1115   Transmission of a distress alert by a station not itself in distress.

#### § § 80.1115

          (a) A station in the mobile or mobile-satellite service which learns that a mobile unit is in distress must initiate and transmit a distress alert relay in any of the following cases:

          (1) When the mobile unit in distress is not itself in a position to transmit the distress alert; or

          (2) When the master or person responsible for the mobile unit not in distress or the person responsible for the land station determines that further help is necessary.

          (b) A station transmitting a distress alert relay in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or § 80.1121(c) must indicate that it is not itself in distress.

          § 80.1117   Procedure for receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts.

#### § § 80.1117

          (a) Normally, distress calls received using digital selective calling are only acknowledged using a DSC acknowledgement by a coast station. Ships should delay any acknowledgement in order to give sufficient time for a coast station to acknowledge the call. In cases where no acknowledgement has been heard and no distress traffic has been heard, the ship should transmit a distress alert relay to the coast station. Upon advice from the Rescue Coordination Center, the ship may transmit a DSC acknowledgement call to stop it from being repeated. Acknowledgement by digital selective calling of receipt of a distress alert in the terrestrial services must comply with ITU-R M.541-9 (incorporated by reference,  § 80.7).

          (b) Acknowledgement through a satellite of receipt of a distress alert from a ship earth station must be sent immediately (see § 80.1119).

          § 80.1119   Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by coast stations and coast earth stations.

#### § § 80.1119

          (a) Coast stations that receive a distress alert should defer acknowledgement for a short interval so that receipt may be acknowledged by a Rescue Coordination Center. Where an acknowledgement is not forthcoming within 3 minutes, the coast station in receipt of distress alerts must ensure that they are routed to a Rescue Coordination Center as soon as possible. Coast stations must provide assistance for distress communications when requested to do so by the U.S. Coast Guard. (This subpart does not specify any radio watches for coast stations.)

          (b) Coast earth stations in receipt of distress alerts must ensure that they are routed as soon as possible to a Rescue Coordination Center. Coast earth stations must relay, as soon as possible, an acknowledgement of a distress alert from a Rescue Coordination Center.

          (c) Certain messages must be carried without charge, regardless of the means by which they are transmitted:

          (1) Distress alert messages;

          (2) Search and rescue coordination messages;

          (3) Medical assistance messages where an imminent danger to life is present, or

          (4) Urgent meteorological or navigational danger messages passed in the ship-to-shore direction.

          § 80.1121   Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by ship stations and ship earth stations.

#### § § 80.1121

          (a) Ship or ship earth stations that receive a distress alert must, as soon as possible, inform the master or person responsible for the ship of the contents of the distress alert.

          (b) For VHF and MF, ships in receipt of a distress alert shall not transmit a distress alert relay, but should listen on the distress traffic channel for 5 minutes and, if appropriate, acknowledge the alert by radiotelephony to the ship in distress and inform the coast station and/or Rescue Coordination Center. Distress alert relays to “all ships” on these bands may only be sent by a ship who has knowledge that another ship in distress is not itself able to transmit the distress alert, and the Master of the ship considers that further help is necessary.

          (c) For HF, ships in receipt of a distress alert shall listen on the distress traffic channel for 5 minutes. If no distress communications are heard and if the call is not acknowledged by a coast station, the ship shall transmit a distress relay on HF to the coast radio station and inform the Rescue Coordination Center. Distress alert relays to “all Ships” on HF may only be sent by a ship who has knowledge that another ship in distress is not itself able to transmit the distress alert, and the Master of the ship considers that further help is necessary.

          (d) In cases where distress alert continues to be received from the same source, the ship may, after consultation with the Rescue Coordination Center, transmit a DSC acknowledgment to terminate the call.

          (e) A ship station in receipt of a shore-to-ship distress alert relay (see § 80.1113(e)) should establish communication as directed and render such assistance as required and appropriate.

          § 80.1123   Watch requirements for ship stations.

#### § § 80.1123

          (a) While at sea, all ships must maintain a continuous watch:

          (1) On VHF DSC channel 70, if the ship is fitted with a VHF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1085(a)(2);

          (2) On the distress and safety DSC frequency 2187.5 kHz, if the ship is fitted with an MF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1089(a)(2) or § 80.1091(a)(3);

          (3) On the distress and safety DSC frequencies 2187.5 kHz and 8414.5 kHz also on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 4207.5 kHz, 6312 kHz, 12577 kHz, or 16804.5 kHz appropriate to the time of day and the geographical position of the ship, if the ship is fitted with an MF/HF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1091(a)(2)(ii) or § 80.1093(a) of this part (this watch may be kept by means of a scanning receiver limited to six distress and safety DSC frequencies); and

          (4) For satellite shore-to-ship distress alert, if the ship is fitted with an INMARSAT ship earth station in accordance with § 80.1091(a)(1).

          (b) While at sea, all ships must maintain radio watches for broadcasts of maritime safety information on the appropriate frequency or frequencies on which such information is broadcast for the area in which the ship is navigating.

          (c) Every ship while at sea must maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF Channel 16. This watch must be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated or at a position which is continuously manned.

          (d) On receipt of a distress alert transmitted by use of digital selective calling techniques, ship stations must set watch on the radiotelephone distress and safety traffic frequency associated with the distress and safety calling frequency on which the distress alert was received.

          (e) Ship stations with narrow-band direct printing equipment must set watch on the narrow-band direct-printing frequency associated with the distress alert signal if it indicates that narrow-band direct-printing is to be used for subsequent distress communications. If practicable, they should additionally set watch on the radiotelephone frequency associated with the distress alert frequency.

          § 80.1125   Search and rescue coordinating communications.

#### § § 80.1125

          (a) The distress signal consists of the word MAYDAY, pronounced in radiotelephony as the French expression “M'aider”. For distress traffic by radiotelephony, when establishing communications, calls must be prefixed by the distress signal MAYDAY.

          (b) Error correction techniques, in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 (incorporated by reference,  § 80.7), as specified in § 80.1101, must be used for distress traffic by direct-printing telegraphy. All messages must be preceded by at least one carriage return, a line feed signal, a letter shift signal and the distress signal MAYDAY.

          (c) Distress communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be in the ARQ mode when ships are communicating directly to the Coast Guard or other coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other distress communications, including those on simplex channels provided for that purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction mode. The ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to do so.

          (d) The Rescue Coordination Center responsible for controlling a search and rescue operation will also coordinate the distress traffic relating to the incident or may appoint another station to do so.

          (e) The Rescue Coordination Center coordinating distress traffic, the unit coordinating search and rescue operations, or the coast station involved may impose silence on stations which interfere with that traffic. This instruction may be addressed to all stations or to one station only, according to circumstances. In either case, the following will be used:

          (1) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY, pronounced as the French expression “silence, m'aider”;

          (2) In narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy normally using forward-error correcting mode, the signal SILENCE MAYDAY. However, the ARQ mode may be used when it is advantageous to do so.

          (f) Until they receive the message indicating that normal working may be resumed (see paragraph (h) of this section), all stations which are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, and which are not in distress, are forbidden to transmit on the frequencies in which the distress traffic is taking place.

          (g) Stations following distress traffic that are able to continue normal service may do so when the distress traffic is well established and on condition that it observes the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section and that it does not interfere with distress traffic.

          (h) When distress traffic has ceased on frequencies which have been used for distress traffic, the Rescue Coordination Center controlling a search and rescue operation must initiate a message for transmission on these frequencies indicating that distress traffic has finished.

          (i) In radiotelephony, the message referred to in paragraph (h) of this section consists of:

          (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;

          (2) The call “Hello all stations” or CQ (spoken as CHARLIE QUEBEC) spoken three times;

          (3) The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in the case of language difficulties);

          (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;

          (5) The time when the distress situation has ceased;

          (6) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;

          (7) The words SEELONCE FEENEE pronounced as the French words “silence fini”

          (j) In direct-printing telegraphy, the message referred to in paragraph (h) of this section consists of:

          (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;

          (2) The call CQ;

          (3) The word DE;

          (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;

          (5) The time when distress situation has ceased;

          (6) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress; and

          (7) The words SILENCE FINI.

          § 80.1127   On-scene communications.

#### § § 80.1127

          (a) On-scene communications are those between mobile unit in distress and assisting mobile units, and between the mobile units and unit coordinating search and rescue operations.

          (b) Control of on-scene communications is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Simplex communications must be used so that all on-scene mobile stations may share relevant information concerning the distress incident. If direct-printing telegraphy is used, it must be in the forward error-correcting mode in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation M.625-3, with Annex, as specified in § 80.1101.

          (c) The preferred frequencies in radiotelephony for on-scene communications are 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz. The frequency 2174.5 kHz may also be used for ship-to-ship on-scene communications using narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy in the forward error correcting mode in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 (incorporated by reference,  § 80.7), as specified in § 80.1101.

          (d) In addition to 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz, the frequencies 3023 kHz, 4125 kHz, 5680 kHz, 123.1 MHz and 156.3 MHz may be used for ship-to-aircraft on-scene communications.

          (e) The selection or designation of on-scene frequencies is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Normally, once an on-scene frequency is established, a continuous aural or teleprinter watch is maintained by all participating on-scene mobile units on the selected frequency.

          § 80.1131   Transmissions of urgency communications.

#### § § 80.1131

          (a) In a terrestrial system the announcement of the urgency message must be made on one or more of the distress and safety calling frequencies specified in § 80.1077 using digital selective calling and the urgency call format. A separate announcement need not be made if the urgency message is to be transmitted through the maritime mobile-satellite service.

          (b) The urgency signal and message must be transmitted on one or more of the distress and safety traffic frequencies specified in § 80.1077, or via the maritime mobile-satellite service or on other frequencies used for this purpose.

          (c) The urgency signal consists of the words PAN PAN. In radiotelephony each word of the group must be pronounced as the French word “panne”.

          (d) The urgency call format and the urgency signal indicate that the calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a mobile unit or a person.

          (e) In radiotelephony, the urgency message must be preceded by the urgency signal, repeated three times, and the identification of the transmitting station.

          (f) In narrow-band direct-printing, the urgency message must be preceded by the urgency signal and the identification of the transmitting station.

          (g) The urgency call format or urgency signal must be sent only on the authority of the master or the person responsible for the mobile unit carrying the mobile station or mobile earth station.

          (h) The urgency call format or the urgency signal may be transmitted by a land station or a coast earth station with the approval of the responsible authority.

          (i) When an urgency message which calls for action by the stations receiving the message has been transmitted, the station responsible for its transmission must cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no longer necessary.

          (j) Error correction techniques, in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 (incorporated by reference,  § 80.7), as specified in § 80.1101, must be used for urgency messages by direct-printing telegraphy. All messages must be preceded by at least one carriage return, a line feed signal, a letter shift signal, and the urgency signal PAN PAN.

          (k) Urgency communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be in the ARQ mode when communicating directly to the Coast Guard or other coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other distress communications, including those on simplex channels provided for that purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction mode. The ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to do so.

        § 87.141   Modulation requirements.

#### § § 87.141

        (a) When A3E emission is used, the modulation percentage must not exceed 100 percent. This requirement does not apply to emergency locator transmitters or survival craft transmitters.

        (b) A double sideband full carrier amplitude modulated radiotelephone transmitter with rated carrier power output exceeding 10 watts must be capable of automatically preventing modulation in excess of 100 percent.

        (c) If any licensed radiotelephone transmitter causes harmful interference to any authorized radio service because of excessive modulation, the Commission will require the use of the transmitter to be discontinued until it is rendered capable of automatically preventing modulation in excess of 100 percent.

        (d) Single sideband transmitters must be able to operate in the following modes:

        (e) Each frequency modulated transmitter operating in the band 72.0-76.0 MHz must have a modulation limiter.

        (f) Each frequency modulated transmitter equipped with a modulation limiter must have a low pass filter between the modulation limiter and the modulated stage. At audio frequencies between 3 kHz and 15 kHz, the filter must have an attenuation greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz by at least 40 log (f/3) db where “f” is the frequency in kilohertz. Above 15 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 28 db greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz.

        (g) Except that symmetric side bands are not required, the modulation characteristics for ELTs must be in accordance with specifications contained in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Standard Order (TSO) Document TSO-C91a titled “Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Equipment” dated April 29, 1985. TSO-C91a is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). TSO-C91a may be obtained from the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Airworthiness, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington DC 20591.

        (h) ELTs must use A3X emission and may use A3E or NON emissions on an optional basis while transmitting. Each transmission of a synthesized or recorded voice message from an ELT must be preceded by the words “this is a recording”; transmission of A3E or NON emission must not exceed 90 seconds; and any transmission of A3E or NON emissions must be followed by at least three minutes of A3X emission.

        (i) ELTs manufactured on or after October 1, 1988, must have a clearly defined carrier frequency distinct from the modulation sidebands for the mandatory emission, A3X, and, if used, the A3E or NON emissions. On 121.500 MHz at least thirty per cent of the total power emitted during any transmission cycle with or without modulation must be contained within plus or minus 30 Hz of the carrier frequency. On 243.000 MHz at least thirty percent of the total power emitted during any transmission cycle with or without modulation must be contained within plus or minus 60 Hz of the carrier frequency. Additionally, if the type of emission is changed during transmission, the carrier frequency must not shift more than plus or minus 30 Hz on 121.500 MHz and not more than plus or minus 60Hz on 243.000 MHz. The long term stability of the carrier frequency must comply with the requirements in § 87.133 of this part.

        (j) Transmitters used at Aircraft earth stations must employ BPSK for transmission rates up to and including 2400 bits per second, and QPSK for higher rates.

        (k) Universal Access Transceiver transmitters must use F1D modulation without phase discontinuities.

        § 87.143   Transmitter control requirements.

#### § § 87.143

        (a) Each transmitter must be installed so that it is not accessible to, or capable of being operated by persons other than those authorized by the licensee.

        (b) Each station must be provided with a control point at the location of the transmitting equipment, unless otherwise specifically authorized. Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by paragraph (e) of this section, a control point is the location at which the radio operator is stationed. It is the position at which the transmitter(s) can immediately be turned off.

        (c) Applicants for additional control points at aeronautical advisory (unicom) stations must specify the location of each proposed control point.

        (d) Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by paragraph (f) of this section, the control point must have the following facilities installed:

        (1) A device that indicates when the transmitter is radiating or when the transmitter control circuits have been switched on. This requirement does not apply to aircraft stations;

        (2) Aurally monitoring of all transmissions originating at dispatch points;

        (3) A way to disconnect dispatch points from the transmitter; and

        (4) A way to turn off the transmitter.

        (e) A dispatch point is an operating position subordinate to the control point. Dispatch points may be installed without authorization from the Commission, and dispatch point operators are not required to be licensed.

        (f) In the aeronautical enroute service, the control point for an automatically controlled enroute station is the computer facility which controls the transmitter. Any computer controlled transmitter must be equipped to automatically shut down after 3 minutes of continuous transmission of an unmodulated carrier.

        § 87.145   Acceptability of transmitters for licensing.

#### § § 87.145

        (a) Each transmitter must be certificated for use in these services, except as listed in paragraph (c) of this section. However, aircraft stations which transmit on maritime mobile frequencies must use transmitters certificated for use in ship stations in accordance with part 80 of this chapter. Certification under part 80 is not required for aircraft earth stations transmitting on maritime mobile-satellite frequencies. Such stations must be certificated under part 87.

        (b) Some radio equipment installed on air carrier aircraft must meet the requirements of the Commission and the requirements of the FAA. The FAA requirements may be obtained from the FAA, Aircraft Maintenance Division, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591.

        (c) The equipment listed below is exempted from certification. The operation of transmitters which have not been certificated must not result in harmful interference due to the failure of those transmitters to comply with technical standards of this subpart.

        (1) Flight test station transmitters for limited periods where justified.

        (2) U.S. Government transmitters furnished in the performance of a U.S. Government contract if the use of certificated equipment would increase the cost of the contract or if the transmitter will be incorporated in the finished product. However, such equipment must meet the technical standards contained in this subpart.

        (3) ELTs verified in accordance with § 87.147(e).

        (4) Signal generators when used as radionavigation land test stations (MTF).

        (d) Aircraft earth stations must correct their transmit frequencies for Doppler effect relative to the satellite. The transmitted signal may not deviate more than 335 Hz from the desired transmit frequency. (This is a root sum square error which assumes zero error for the received ground earth station signal and includes the AES transmit/receive frequency reference error and the AES automatic frequency control residual errors.) The applicant must attest that the equipment provides adequate Doppler effect compensation and where applicable, that measurements have been made that demonstrate compliance. Submission of data demonstrating compliance is not required unless requested by the Commission.

        § 87.147   Authorization of equipment.

#### § § 87.147

        (a) Certification may be requested by following the procedures in part 2 of this chapter. Aircraft transmitters must meet the requirements over an ambient temperature range of −20 degrees to + 50 degrees Celsius.

        (b) ELTs manufactured after October 1, 1988, must meet the output power characteristics contained in § 87.141(i). A report of the measurements must be submitted with each application for certification. ELTs that meet the output power characteristics of the section must have a permanent label prominently displayed on the outer casing state, “Meets FCC Rule for improved satellite detection.” This label, however, must not be placed on the equipment without authorization to do so by the Commission. Application for such authorization may be made either by submission of a new application for certification accompanied by the required fee and all information and test data required by parts 2 and 87 of this chapter or, for ELTs approved prior to October 1, 1988, a letter requesting such authorization, including appropriate test data and a showing that all units produced under the original equipment authorization comply with the requirements of this paragraph without change to the original circuitry.

        (c) An applicant for a station license may request certification for an individual transmitter by following the procedure in part 2 of this chapter. Such a transmitter will be individually certified and so noted on the station license.

        (d) An applicant for certification of equipment intended for transmission in any of the frequency bands listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section must notify the FAA of the filing of a certification application. The letter of notification must be mailed to: FAA, Office of Spectrum Policy and Management, ASR-1, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591 prior to the filing of the application with the Commission.

        (1) The notification must describe the equipment, give the manufacturer's identification, antenna characteristics, rated output power, emission type and characteristics, the frequency or frequencies of operation, and essential receiver characteristics if protection is required.

        (2) The certification application must include a copy of the notification letter to the FAA. The Commission will not act until it receives the FAA's determination regarding whether it objects to the application for equipment authorization. The FAA should mail its determination to: Office of Engineering and Technology Laboratory, Authorization and Evaluation Division, 7435 Oakland Mills Rd., Columbia, MD 21046. The Commission will consider the FAA determination before taking final action on the application.

        (3) The frequency bands are as follows:

        (e) Supplier's Declaration of Conformity for ELTs capable of operating on the frequency 406.0-406.1 MHz must include sufficient documentation to show that the ELT meets the requirements of § 87.199(a). A letter notifying the FAA of the ELT Supplier's Declaration of Conformity must be mailed to: FAA, Office of Spectrum Policy and Management, ASR-1, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591.

        (f) Certification may be requested for equipment that has the capability to transmit in the 138-144 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, or 150.5-150.8 MHz bands as well as frequency bands set forth in § 87.173. The Commission will only certify this equipment for use in the bands regulated by this part.

      Subpart G—Aeronautical Advisory Stations (Unicoms)

        § 87.213   Scope of service.

#### § § 87.213

        (a) An aeronautical advisory station (unicom) must provide service to any aircraft station upon request and without discrimination. A unicom must provide impartial information concerning available ground services.

        (b)(1) Unicom transmissions must be limited to the necessities of safe and expeditious operation of aircraft such as condition of runways, types of fuel available, wind conditions, weather information, dispatching, or other necessary information. At any airport at which a control tower, control tower remote communications outlet station (RCO) or FAA flight service station is located, unicoms must not transmit information pertaining to the conditions of runways, wind conditions, or weather information during the hours of operation of the control tower, RCO or FAA service station.

        (2) On a secondary basis, unicoms may transmit communications which pertain to the efficient portal-to-portal transit of an aircraft, such as requests for ground transportation, food or lodging.

        (3) Communications between unicoms and air carrier must be limited to the necessities of safety of life and property.

        (4) Unicoms may communicate with aeronautical utility stations and ground vehicles concerning runway conditions and safety hazards on the airport when neither a control tower nor FAA flight service station is in operation.

        (c) Unicoms must not be used for air traffic control (ATC) purposes other than to relay ATC information between the pilot and air traffic controller. Relaying of ATC information is limited to the following:

        (1) Revisions of proposed departure time;

        (2) Takeoff, arrival or flight plan cancellation time;

        (3) ATC clearances, provided a letter of agreement is obtained from the FAA by the licensee of the unicom.

        § 87.215   Supplemental eligibility.

#### § § 87.215

        (a) A unicom and any associated dispatch or control points must be located on the airport to be served.

        (b) Only one unicom will be authorized to operate at an airport which does not have a control tower, RCO or FAA flight service station that operates on the published common traffic advisory frequency. At any other airport, the one unicom limitation does not apply, and the airport operator and all aviation services organizations may be licensed to operate a unicom on the assigned frequency.

        (c) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, eligibility for new unicom licenses is restricted to State or local government entities, and to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that are authorized to apply for the license by a State or local government entity whose primary mission is the provision of public safety services. All applications submitted by NGOs must be accompanied by a new, written certification of support (for the NGO applicant to operate the applied for station) by the state or local government entity. Applications for a unicom license at the same airport, where only one unicom may be licensed, that are filed by two or more applicants meeting these eligibility criteria must be resolved through settlement or technical amendment.

        (d) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, the license may be assigned or transferred only to an entity meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

        (e) An applicant for renewal of a unicom license shall be granted a presumptive renewal expectancy regardless of whether the applicant is eligible for a new unicom license under paragraph (c) of this section. Unless the renewal expectancy is defeated, applications that are mutually exclusive with the renewal application will not be accepted. The renewal expectancy may be defeated only upon a determination, following a hearing duly designated on the basis of a petition to deny or on the Commission's own motion, that the renewal applicant has not provided substantial service. For purposes of this paragraph, substantial service means service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service during the applicant's past license term. If the renewal expectancy is defeated, the renewal application will be dismissed unless the renewal applicant is eligible for a new unicom license pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

        (f) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, when the Commission believes that the unicom has been abandoned or has ceased operation, another unicom may be licensed on an interim basis pending final determination of the status of the original unicom. An applicant for an interim license must notify the present licensee and must comply with the notice requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.

        (g) An applicant for a unicom license, renewal or modification of frequency assignment at an airport which does not have a control tower, RCO or FAA flight service station must notify in writing the owner of the airport and all aviation service organizations located at the airport. The notice must include the applicant's name and address, the name of the airport and a statement that the applicant intends to file an application with the Commission for a unicom. The notice must be given within the ten days preceding the filing of the application with the Commission. Each applicant must certify upon application that either notice has been given and include the date of notification, or notice is not required because the applicant owns the airport and there are no organizations that should be notified.

        (a) Military or other Government stations have been authorized to establish wide-band systems using frequency-hopping spread spectrum techniques in the 960-1215 MHz band. Authorization for a Joint Tactical Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS) has been permitted on the basis of non-interference to the established aeronautical radionavigation service in this band. In order to accommodate the requirements for the system within the band, restrictions are imposed. Transmissions will be automatically prevented if:

        (1) The frequency-hopping mode fails to distribute the JTIDS spectrum uniformly across the band;

        (2) The radiated pulse varies from the specified width of 6.4 microseconds ±5%;

        (3) The energy radiated within ±7 MHz of 1030 and 1090 MHz exceeds a level of 60 dB below the peak of the JTIDS spectrum as measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth. The JTIDS will be prohibited from transmitting if the time slot duty factor exceeds a 20 percent duty factor for any single user and a 40 percent composite duty factor for all JTIDS emitters in a geographic area.

        (b) If radionavigation systems operating in the 960-1215 MHz band experience interference or unexplained loss of equipment performance, the situation must be reported immediately to the nearest office of the FAA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Washington, DC 20504, or the nearest Federal Communications Commission field office. The following information must be provided to the extent available:

        (1) Name, call sign and category of station experiencing the interference;

        (2) Date and time of occurrence;

        (3) Geographical location at time of occurrence;

        (4) Frequency interfered with;

        (5) Nature of interference; and

        (6) Other particulars.

        § 87.481   Unattended operation of domestic radiobeacon stations.

#### § § 87.481

        (a) Radiobeacons may be licensed for unattended operation. An applicant must comply with the following:

        (1) The transmitter is crystal controlled and specifically designed for radiobeacon service and capable of transmitting by self-actuating means;

        (2) The emissions of the transmitter must be continuously monitored by a licensed operator, or by a direct positive automatic monitor, supplemented by aural monitoring at suitable intervals;

        (3) If as a result of aural monitoring it is determined that a deviation from the terms of the station license has occurred, the transmitters must be disabled immediately by a properly authorized person. If automatic monitoring is used, the monitor must insure that the operation of the transmitter meets the license terms or is disabled;

        (4) A properly authorized person must be able to reach the transmitter and disable it in a reasonable amount of time, so as not to adversely affect life or property in the air;

        (5) The equipment must be inspected at least every 180 days. Results of inspections must be kept in the station maintenance records;

        (6) The transmitter is not operable by or accessible to, other than authorized persons;

        (7) The transmitter is in a remote location.

        (b) Authority for unattended operation must be expressly stated in the station license.

        § 87.483   Audio visual warning systems.

#### § § 87.483

        An audio visual warning system (AVWS) is a radar-based obstacle avoidance system. AVWS activates obstruction lighting and transmits VHF audible warnings to alert pilots of potential collisions with land-based obstructions. The AVWS operations are limited to locations where natural and man-made obstructions exist. The continuously operating radar calculates the location, direction and groundspeed of nearby aircraft that enter one of two warning zones reasonably established by the licensee. As aircraft enter the first warning zone, the AVWS activates obstruction lighting. If the aircraft continues toward the obstacle and enters the second warning zone, the VHF radio transmits an audible warning describing the obstacle.

        (a) Radiodetermination (radar) frequencies. Frequencies authorized under § 87.475(b)(8) of this chapter are available for use by an AVWS. The frequency coordination requirements in § 87.475(a) of this chapter apply.

        (b) VHF audible warning frequencies. Frequencies authorized under § 87.187(j), § 87.217(a), § 87.241(b), and § 87.323(b) (excluding 121.950 MHz) of this chapter are available for use by an AVWS. Multiple frequencies may be authorized for an individual station, depending on need and the use of frequencies assigned in the vicinity of a proposed AVWS facility. Use of these frequencies is subject to the following limitations:

        (1) The output power shall not exceed −3 dBm watts for each frequency authorized.

        (2) The antenna used in transmitting the audible warnings must be omnidirectional with a maximum gain equal to or lower than a half-wave centerfed dipole above 30 degrees elevation, and a maximum gain of + 5 dBi from horizontal up to 30 degrees elevation.

        (3) The audible warning shall not exceed two seconds in duration. No more than six audible warnings may be transmitted in a single transmit cycle, which shall not exceed 12 seconds in duration. An interval of at least twenty seconds must occur between transmit cycles.

        § 87.529   Frequencies.

#### § § 87.529

        Prior to submitting an application, each applicant must notify the applicable FAA Regional Frequency Management Office. Each application must be accompanied by a statement showing the name of the FAA Regional Office and date notified. The Commission will assign the frequency. Normally, frequencies available for air traffic control operations set forth in subpart E will be assigned to an AWOS, ASOS, or to an ATIS. When a licensee has entered into an agreement with the FAA to operate the same station as both an AWOS and as an ATIS, or as an ASOS and an ATIS, the same frequency will be used in both modes of operation.

The frequency or frequencies requested must be in accordance with a frequency utilization plan, for the area involved, on file with the Commission.

        (g)  (1) We define service areas in the marine VHF (156-162 MHz) band by forty-two geographic areas called VHF Public Coast Service Areas (VPCSAs). See § 80.371(c)(1)(ii) of this chapter (Public correspondence frequencies). VPCSAs are based on, and composed of one or more of, the U.S. Department of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs). See 60 Fed Reg. 13114 (Mar. 10, 1995). Maps of the EAs and VPCSAs are available for inspection through the Federal Communications Commission's Reference Information Center. These maps and data are also available on the FCC website at  We number public correspondence channels in the maritime VHF (156-162 MHz) band as channels 24 to 28 and channels 84 to 88. Each channel number represents a channel pair. See § 80.371(c) of this chapter.

        (2) In VHF Public Coast Service Areas (VPCSAs) 10-42, the duplex channel pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz (VHF Maritime Channel 25) is allocated for public safety use by entities eligible for licensing under paragraph (a) of this section, and is designated primarily for the purpose of interoperability communications.  47 CFR 80.371(c)(1)(ii) for the definitions of VPCSAs.

        (i) The channel pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz was formerly allocated and assigned (under § 80.371(c) (1997) of this chapter) as a public correspondence working channel in the maritime VHF 156-162 MHz band, and was also shared (under former § 90.283 (1997) of this chapter) with private land mobile stations, including grandfathered public safety licensees. Thus, there are grandfathered licensees nationwide (maritime and private land mobile radio stations, including by rule waiver) operating on this channel both inside and outside of VPCSAs 10-42.

        (ii) The channel pairs 157.225 MHz/161.825 MHz and 157.275 MHz/161.875 MHz were formerly allocated and assigned under this section as public safety interoperability channels but were reallocated for assignment as VHF public coast station channels under § 80.371(c) of this chapter. Public safety operations licensed on these channels as of March 2, 2009 or licensed pursuant to an application filed prior to September 19, 2008, may remain authorized to operate on the channels on a primary basis until March 2, 2024.

        (3) All applicants and licensees under this paragraph must comply with the relevant technical sections under this part unless otherwise stated in this paragraph (g) of this section using the following standards and procedures:

        (i) Provide evidence of frequency coordination in accordance with § 90.175. Public safety coordinators except the Special Emergency Coordinator are certified to coordinate applications for the channel pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz (, letter symbol PX under paragraph (c)(2) of this section).

        (ii) Station power, as measured at the output terminals of the transmitter, must not exceed 50 Watts for base stations and 20 Watts for mobile stations, except in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g)(3)(vi) of this section. Antenna height (HAAT) must not exceed 122 meters (400 feet) for base stations and 4.5 meters (15 feet) for mobile stations, except in accordance with paragraph (g)(3)(vi) of this section. Antenna height (HAAT) must not exceed 122 meters (400 feet) for base stations and 4.5 meters (15 feet) for mobile stations, except in accordance with paragraph (g)(3)(vi) of this section. Such base and mobile channels shall not be operated on board aircraft in flight.

        (iii) Frequency protection must be provided to other stations in accordance with the following guidelines for each channel and for each area and adjacent area:

        (A) Protect coast stations licensed prior to July 6, 1998, by the required separations shown in Table C below.

        (B) Protect stations described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, by frequency coordination in accordance § 90.175 of this part.

        (C) Protect public safety stations granted under paragraph (g) of this section by frequency coordination in accordance with § 90.175 of this part.

        (D)  Applicants shall engineer base stations such that the maximum signal strength at the boundary of the adjacent VPCSA does not exceed 5dBµV/m.

        (iv) The following table, along with the antenna height (HAAT) and power (ERP), must be used to determine the minimum separation required between proposed base stations and co-channel public coast stations licensed prior to July 6, 1998 under part 80 of this chapter. Applicants whose exact ERP or HAAT are not reflected in the table must use the next highest figure shown.

        (v) In the event of interference, the Commission may require, without a hearing, licensees of base stations authorized under this section that are located within 241 kilometers (150 miles) of a co-channel public coast, I/LT, or grandfathered public safety station licensed prior to July 6, 1998, or an international border, to reduce power, decrease antenna height, and/or install directional antennas.

        Mobile stations must be operated only within radio range of their associated base station.

        (vi) Applicants seeking to be licensed for stations exceeding the power/antenna height limits of the table in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section must request a waiver of that paragraph and must submit with their application an interference analysis, based upon an appropriate, generally-accepted terrain-based propagation model, that shows that co-channel protected entities, described in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, would receive the same or greater interference protection than the relevant criteria outlined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section.

        (h)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, licen__see__s in the Public Safety Radio Services ( part 90, subpart B) may enter into spectrum leasing arrangements ( part 1, subpart X of this chapter) with entities providing communications in support of public safety operations.

        (i)  The nationwide interoperability and mutual aid channels are listed below for the VHF, (including 220-222 MHz), UHF, 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands. (See §§ 90.20(d)(80), 90.531(b)(1), 90.617(a)(1) and 90.720). Any Part 90 public safety eligible entity holding a Part 90 license may operate hand-held and vehicular mobile units on these channels without needing a separate authorization. Base stations or control stations operating on these channels must be licensed separately: Encryption may not be used on any of the interoperability or mutual aid calling channels.

        § 90.155   Time in which station must be placed in operation.

#### § § 90.155

        (a) All stations authorized under this part, except as provided in §§ 90.528, 90.529, 90.629, 90.631(f), 90.665, and 90.685 must be placed in operation within twelve (12) months from the date of grant or the authorization cancels automatically and must be returned to the Commission.

        (b) A local government entity in the Public Safety Pool, applying for any frequency in this part, may also seek extended implementation authorization pursuant to § 90.629.

        (c) For purposes of this section, a base station is not considered to be placed in operation unless at least one associated mobile station is also placed in operation. See also §§ 90.633(d) and 90.631(f).

        (d) Multilateration LMS EA-licen__see__s, authorized in accordance with § 90.353, must construct and place in operation a sufficient number of base stations that utilize multilateration technology ( paragraph (e) of this section) to provide multilateration location service to one-third of the EA's population within five years of initial license grant, and two-thirds of the population within ten years. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to their licensed area within the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks. In demonstrating compliance with the construction and coverage requirements, the Commission will allow licensees to individually determine an appropriate field strength for reliable service, taking into account the technologies employed in their system design and other relevant technical factors. At the five- and ten-year benchmarks, licensees will be required to file a map and FCC Form 601 showing compliance with the coverage requirements ( § 1.946 of this chapter).

        (e) A multilateration LMS station will be considered constructed and placed in operation if it is built in accordance with its authorized parameters and is regularly interacting with one or more other stations to provide location service, using multilateration technology, to one or more mobile units. Specifically, LMS multilateration stations will only be considered constructed and placed in operation if they are part of a system that can interrogate a mobile, receive the response at 3 or more sites, compute the location from the time of arrival of the responses and transmit the location either back to the mobile or to a subscriber's fixed site.

        (f) For purposes of this section, a station licensed to provide commercial mobile radio service is not considered to have commenced service unless it provides service to at least one unaffiliated party.

        (g) Application for extension of time to commence service may be made on FCC Form 601. Extensions of time must be filed prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be granted only if the licensee shows that the failure to commence service is due to causes beyond its control. No extensions will be granted for delays caused by lack of financing, lack of site availability, for the assignment or transfer of control of an authorization, or for failure to timely order equipment. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of the license grant, a presumption of due diligence is created.

        (h) An application for modification of an authorization (under construction) at the existing location does not extend the initial construction period. If additional time to commence service is required, a request for such additional time must be submitted on FCC Form 601, either separately or in conjunction with the submission of the FCC Form 601 requesting modification.

        (i) DSRCS Roadside Units (RSUs) under subpart M of this part in the 5895-5925 MHz band must be placed in operation within 12 months from the effective date of registration (see § 90.375) or the authority to operate the RSUs cancels automatically (see § 1.955 of this chapter). Such registration date(s) do not change the overall renewal period of the single license. Licensees must notify the Commission in accordance with § 1.946 of this chapter when registered units are placed in operation within their construction period.

        Mutually exclusive commercial mobile radio service applications are processed in accordance with part 1 of this chapter and with the rules in this section, except for mutually exclusive applications for licenses in the 220-222 MHz service and the 929-930 MHz Paging service, which are processed in accordance with the rules in subpart P and subpart T of this part.

        Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more of the others under Commission rules governing the services involved.

        (a)  Any applicant that files an application knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a separate application.

        (b)  Pending mutually exclusive applications are processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as defective (pursuant to § 1.934 of this chapter) any mutually exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A filing group is one of the following types:

        (1)  A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is normally the filing date of the first-filed applications(s).

        (2)  A 30-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates) as acceptable for filing.

        (3)  A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day filing window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.

        (c)  Generally, the Commission may grant one application in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by the grant, pursuant to § 1.935 of this chapter.

        (1)  In selecting the application to grant, the Commission may use competitive bidding, random selection, or comparative hearings, depending on the type of applications involved.

        (2)  The Commission may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under § 1.934 of this chapter, either before or after employing selection procedures.

        (3)  Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more mutually exclusive applications depends on the purpose(s) of the applications.

        (i) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is used.

        (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification, a same-day filing group is used.

        (4)  If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:

        (i) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.

        (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other applications may be dismissed without prejudice.

        (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application for modification or an application for facilities, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.

        (ii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.

        (iii) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

        (d)  For the purposes of this section, terms have the following meanings:

        (1) The “filing date” of an application is the date on which that application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments in the following circumstances:

        (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;

        (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found unacceptable for filing; or

        (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.

        (2) An “application for initial authorization” is:

        (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or station;

        (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking; or

        (iii) any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or channel block.

Any licensee having sixteen (16) or more full-time employees that changes its existing equal employment opportunity program shall file with the Commission, no later than May 31st thereafter, a revised statement reflecting the change(s).

        (c)  Each licensee, regardless of how many employees it has, shall submit an annual report to the Commission no later than May 31st of each year indicating whether any complaints regarding violations by the licensee or equal employment provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law have been filed before anybody having competent jurisdiction.

        (1) The report should state the parties involved, the date filing, the courts or agencies before which the matters have been heard, the appropriate file number (if any), and the respective disposition or current status of any such complaints.

        (2) Any licensee who has filed such information with the EEOC may file a notification of such filing with the Commission in lieu of a report.

        (d)  Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier licensee are considered by the Commission in the following manner:

        (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is submitted to that agency. The Commission maintains a liaison with that agency that keeps the Commission informed of the disposition of complaints filed against common carrier licensees.

        (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties apply, may be submitted by the Commission to the respective State agency.

        (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC or an appropriate State law, are accorded appropriate treatment by the Commission.

        (4) The Commission will consult with the EEOC on all matters relating to the evaluation and determination of compliance by the common carrier licensees with the principles of equal employment as set forth herein.

        (5) Complaints indicating a general pattern of disregard of equal employment practices which are received against a licensee that is required to file an employment report to the Commission under § 1.815(a) of this chapter are investigated by the Commission.

        (e)  A copy of every annual employment report, equal employment opportunity program statement, reports on complaints regarding violation of equal employment provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law, and copies of all exhibits, letters, and other documents filed as part thereof, all amendments thereto, all correspondence between the licensee and the Commission pertaining to the reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated therein by reference, are open for public inspection at the offices of the Commission.

        (f)  Each licensee required to file annual employment reports (pursuant to § 1.815(a) of this chapter), equal employment opportunity program statements, and annual reports on complaints regarding violations of equal employment provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law shall maintain for public inspection a file containing a copy of each such report and copies of all exhibits, letters, and other documents filed as part thereto, all correspondence between the licensee and the Commission pertaining to the reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated therein by reference. The documents must be retained for a period of two (2) years.

        § 90.169   Construction prior to grant of application.

#### § § 90.169

        Applicants may construct facilities prior to grant of their applications, subject to the provisions of this section, but must not operate such facilities until the Commission grants an authorization. If the conditions stated in this section are not met, applicants must not begin to construct facilities.

        (a)  An applicant may begin construction of a facility thirty-five (35) days after the date of the Public Notice listing the application for that facility as acceptable for filing.

        (b)  If the Commission for any reason determines that construction should not be started or should be stopped while an application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction immediately.

        (c)  Applicants that begin construction pursuant to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses resulting from:

        (1) Applications that are not granted;

        (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;

        (3) Having to alter, relocate, or dismantle the facility; or

        (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility into compliance with applicable laws, or Commission rules and orders.

        (d)  Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other application;

        (2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;

        (3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one or more Commission rules;

        (4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the requirements of § 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the Commission;

        (5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in accordance with §§ 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,

        (6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration is not required.

      Subpart H—Policies Governing the Assignment of Frequencies

        § 90.171   Scope.

#### § § 90.171

        This subpart contains detailed information concerning the policies under which the Commission assigns frequencies for the use of licensees under this part, frequency coordination procedures, and procedures under which licensees may cooperatively share radio facilities.

        § 90.173   Policies governing the assignment of frequencies.

#### § § 90.173

        (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (j) of this section, the frequencies which ordinarily may be assigned to stations in the services governed by this part are listed in subparts B, C and F of this part. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, frequencies assigned to land mobile stations are available on a shared basis only and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee.

        (b) All applicants and licensees shall cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies in order to reduce interference and make the most effective use of the authorized facilities. Licensees of stations suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further the use of any frequency at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the judgment of the Commission, its use in that location is not in the public interest; the use of any frequency may be restricted as to specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.

        (c) Frequencies assigned to Federal Government radio stations by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration may be authorized under the provisions set forth in § 2.102(c) of this chapter.

        (d) The radio facilities authorized under this part are intended for use in connection with and as an adjunct to the primary governmental or business activities of the licensee.

        (e) Persons requesting authority to operate in the band 25-50 MHz should recognize that this band is shared with various services in other countries and that harmful interference may be caused by the propagation of signals in this band from distant stations. No protection from such harmful interference generally can be expected.

        (f) Applications for stations in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz bands for operation on frequencies 15 kHz or less removed from existing stations in the same geographic area will be granted based upon a recommendation from the applicable frequency coordinator as specified in §§ 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b)(2).

        (g) In the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and in areas outside the continental limits of the United States and the adjacent waters, the frequencies above 150.8 MHz which are listed elsewhere in this part as available for assignment to base stations or mobile stations in the Industrial/Business Pool are also available for assignment to operational fixed stations in the Industrial/Business Pool on a secondary basis.

        (h) In the Public Safety Pool, base stations may be authorized to operate on a secondary basis on frequencies below 450 MHz which are available to mobile stations.

        (i) In the 450-470 MHz band, the frequencies are ordinarily assigned in pairs, with the mobile station transmit frequency 5 MHz above the paired base station transmit frequency. In the 470-512 MHz band, the frequencies are ordinarily assigned in pairs with the mobile station transmit frequency 3 MHz above the paired base station transmit frequency. In the Industrial/Business Pool, in the 150 MHz band, the frequencies subject to § 90.35(c)(6) may be assigned in pairs with the separation between base and mobile frequencies being 5.26 MHz. A mobile station may be assigned the frequency which would normally be assigned to a base station for single-frequency operation. However, this single-frequency operation may be subject to interference that would not occur to a two-frequency system.

        (j) Frequencies other than those listed in subparts B and C of this part may be assigned in the 150-174 MHz, 421-430 MHz, 450-470 MHz, and 470-512 MHz bands, provided the following conditions are met:

        (1) Such applications must be accompanied by a showing of frequency coordination in accordance with the requirements of § 90.175;

        (2) The frequencies must not be available in any other rule part of this chapter; and

        (3) The authorized bandwidth of any system operating in accordance with this paragraph must not overlap spectrum available in other rule parts of this chapter unless that spectrum is also allocated in part 90.

        (k) This paragraph is only applicable to entities with Finder's Preference requests pending before the Commission as of July 29, 1998. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, any eligible person shall be given a dispositive preference for a channel assignment on an exclusive basis in the 220-222 MHz, 470-512 MHz, and 800/900 MHz (except on frequencies designated exclusively for SMR service) bands by submitting information that leads to the recovery of channels in these bands. Recovery of such channels must result from information provided regarding the failure of existing licensees to comply with the provisions of § 90.155, § 90.157, § 90.629, § 90.631 (e) or (f), or § 90.633 (c) or (d).

        (l) In the 150-174 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or less. Authorizations for all other frequencies in this band will be granted with channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less ( in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to §§ 90.20 (d)(27) and (d)(44), and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to §§ 90.35 (c)(30) and (c)(33)).

        (m) In the 421-512 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or less. New authorizations for frequencies 12.5 kHz removed from these frequencies will be made for channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less ( in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to § 90.20(d)(27) and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to § 90.35(c)(30)). Authorizations for frequencies 6.25 kHz removed from these frequencies will be granted with channel bandwidths of 6.25 kHz or less ( in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to § 90.20(d)(44), and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to § 90.35(c)(33)).

        (n) Any recovered channels in the 800 MHz SMR service will revert automatically to the holder of the EA license within which such channels are included. If there is no EA licensee for recovered channels, such channels will be retained by the Commission for future licensing.

        § 90.175   Frequency coordinator requirements.

#### § § 90.175

        Except for applications listed in paragraph (j) of this section, each application for a new frequency assignment, for a change in existing facilities as listed in § 90.135(a), or for operation at temporary locations in accordance with § 90.137 must include a showing of frequency coordination as set forth further.

        (a) Frequency coordinators may request, and applicants are required to provide, all appropriate technical information, system requirements, and justification for requested station parameters when such information is necessary to identify and recommend the most appropriate frequency. Additionally, applicants bear the burden of proceeding and the burden of proof in requesting the Commission to overturn a coordinator's recommendation.

        (b)  (1) A statement is required from the applicable frequency coordinator as specified in §§ 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b) recommending the most appropriate frequency. In addition, for frequencies to which § 90.35(c)(63) or (66) is applicable, the written concurrence of the Commission-certified frequency coordinator for frequencies designated for central station alarm operations must be obtained. In addition, for frequencies above 150 MHz, if the interference contour of a proposed station would overlap the service contour of a station on a frequency formerly shared prior to radio service consolidation by licensees in the Manufacturers Radio Service, the Forest Products Radio Service, the Power Radio Service, the Petroleum Radio Service, the Motor Carrier Radio Service, the Railroad Radio Service, the Telephone Maintenance Radio Service or the Automobile Emergency Radio Service, the written concurrence of the coordinator for the industry-specific service, or the written concurrence of the licensee itself, must be obtained. Requests for concurrence must be responded to within 20 days of receipt of the request. The written request for concurrence shall advise the receiving party of the maximum 20 day response period. The coordinator's recommendation may include comments on technical factors such as power, antenna height and gain, terrain and other factors which may serve to minimize potential interference. In addition:

        (2) On frequencies designated for coordination or concurrence by a specific frequency coordinator as specified in §§ 90.20(c)(3) and 90.35(b), and on frequencies designated for concurrence as specified in § 90.35(c)(63) or (66), the applicable frequency coordinator shall provide a written supporting statement in instances in which coordination or concurrence is denied. The supporting statement shall contain sufficient detail to permit discernment of the technical basis for the denial of concurrence. Concurrence may be denied only when a grant of the underlying application would have a demonstrable, material, adverse effect on safety.

        (3) In instances in which a frequency coordinator determines that an applicant's requested frequency or the most appropriate frequency is one designated for coordination or concurrence by a specific frequency coordinator as specified in § 90.20(c)(3) or § 90.35(b), that frequency coordinator may forward the application directly to the appropriate frequency coordinator. A frequency coordinator may only forward an application as specified above if consent is received from the applicant.

        (4) For any application for mobile repeater station operations on frequencies denoted by both § 90.20(d)(90) and (92), or by both § 90.35(c)(93) and (95) the frequency coordinator responsible for the application must determine and disclose to the applicant the call signs and the service areas of all active co-channel incumbent remote control and telemetry stations inside the applicant's proposed area of operation by adding a special condition to the application, except when the applicant has obtained written concurrence from an affected incumbent licensee, or when the applicant and the incumbent licensee are the same entity.

        (c)  When frequencies are shared by more than one service, concurrence must be obtained from the other applicable certified coordinators.

        (d)  When used for secondary fixed operations, frequencies shall be assigned and coordinated pursuant to § 90.261.

        (e) For frequencies between  A recommendation of the specific frequencies that are available for assignment in accordance with the loading standards and mileage separations applicable to the specific radio service, frequency pool, or category of user involved is required from an applicable frequency coordinator. In addition, a frequency coordinator must perform the contour overlap analysis detailed in § 90.621(d) when coordinating applications for channels in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz band segment once interstitial 12.5 kHz bandwidth channels become available for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region.

        (f)  A statement is required from the coordinator recommending the most appropriate frequency.

        (g)  A statement is required as follows.

        (1)  A statement is required from the coordinator recommending the most appropriate frequency, operating power and area of operation in accordance with the requirements of § 90.259(b).

        (2)  A statement is required from the nationwide band manager recommending the most appropriate channel(s), bandwidth, operating power, and any other technical parameter which promotes robust and efficient use of the band while minimizing interference.

        (3)  Paragraph (g)(2) of this section may contain information collection and/or recordkeeping requirements. Compliance with paragraph (g)(2) will not be required until this paragraph (g)(3) is removed or contains a compliance date, which will not occur until the date specified in a final rule published by the FCC announcing that the Office of Management and Budget has completed review of any information collection requirements associated with paragraph (g)(2) of this section or that they have determined such review is not required, which date shall be no earlier than February 28, 2024.

        (h) Any recommendation submitted in accordance with paragraphs (a), (c), (d), or (e) of this section is advisory in character and is not an assurance that the Commission will grant a license for operation on that frequency. Therefore, applicants are strongly advised not to purchase radio equipment operating on specific frequencies until a valid authorization has been obtained from the Commission.

        (i) Applications for facilities near the Canadian border north of line A or east of line C in Alaska may require coordination with the Canadian government.  § 1.928 of this chapter.

        (j) The following applications need not be accompanied by evidence of frequency coordination:

        (1) Applications for frequencies below 25 MHz.

        (2) Applications for a Federal Government frequency.

        (3) Applications for frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band except for mobile frequencies subject to § 90.35(c)(77).

        (4) [Reserved]

        (5) Applications in the Industrial/Business Pool requesting a frequency designated for itinerant operations.

        § 90.179   Shared use of radio stations.

#### § § 90.179

        Licensees of radio stations authorized under this rule part may share the use of their facilities. A station is shared when persons not licensed for the station control the station for their own purposes pursuant to the licensee's authorization. Shared use of a radio station may be either on a non-profit cost shared basis or on a for-profit private carrier basis. Shared use of an authorized station is subject to the following conditions and limitations:

        (a) Persons may share a radio station only on frequencies for which they would be eligible for a separate authorization.

        (b) The licensee of the shared radio station is responsible for assuring that the authorized facility is used only by persons and only for purposes consistent with the requirements of this rule part.

        (c) Participants in the sharing arrangement may obtain a license for their own mobile units (including control points and/or control stations for control of the shared facility), or they may use mobile stations, and control stations or control points authorized to the licensee.

        (d) If the licensee shares the land station on a non-profit, cost shared basis to the licensee, this shared use must be pursuant to a written agreement between the licensee and each participant which sets out (1) the method of operation, (2) the components of the system which are covered by the sharing arrangements, (3) the method by which costs are to be apportioned, and (4) acknowledgement that all shared transmitter use must be subject to the licensee's control. These agreements must be kept as part of the station records.

        (e) If the land station which is being shared is interconnected with the public switched telephone network, the provisions of § 90.477  apply.

        (f) Above 800 MHz, shared use on a for-profit private carrier basis is permitted only by SMR, Private Carrier Paging, LMS, and DSRCS licensees. See subparts M, P, and S of this part.

        (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, licensees authorized to operate radio systems on Public Safety Pool frequencies designated in § 90.20 may share their facilities with Federal Government entities on a non-profit, cost-shared basis. Such a sharing arrangement is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section, and § 2.103(c) of this chapter concerning operations in the 758-769 MHz and 788-799 MHz bands. State governments authorized to operate radio systems under § 90.529 may share the use of their systems (for public safety services not made commercially available to the public) with any entity that would be eligible for licensing under § 90.523 and Federal government entities.

        (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, licensees authorized to operate radio systems on Industrial/Business Pool frequencies designated in § 90.35 may share their facilities with Public Safety Pool entities designated in § 90.20 and with Federal Government entities on a non-profit, cost-shared basis. Such a sharing arrangement is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section.

        (i) The provisions of this section do not apply to licensees authorized to provide commercial mobile radio service under this part, including licensees authorized to use channels transferred or assigned pursuant to § 90.621(e)(2).

        (j) On the Interoperability Channels in the 700 MHz Public Safety Band ( 90.531(b)(1)), hand-held and vehicular units operated by any licensee holding a license in the 700 MHz Public Safety Band or by any licensee for any public safety frequency pursuant to part 90 of the Commission's rules may communicate with or through land stations without further authorization and without a sharing agreement.

        § 90.187   Trunking in the bands between 150 and 512 MHz.

#### § § 90.187

        (a) Applicants for centralized and decentralized trunked systems operating on frequencies between 150 and 512 MHz (except 220-222 MHz) must indicate on their applications (radio service and class of station code, instructions for FCC Form 601) that their system will be trunked. Licensees of stations that are not trunked may trunk their systems only after modifying their license (see § 1.927 of this chapter).

        (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, trunked systems operating under this section must employ equipment that prevents transmission on a trunked frequency if a signal from another system is present on that frequency. The level of monitoring must be sufficient to avoid harmful interference to other systems.

        (c) The monitoring requirement in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to trunked systems operating in the 470-512 MHz band that meet the loading requirements of § 90.313 and have exclusive use of their frequencies in their service area.

        (d) The monitoring requirement in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the application is accompanied by written consent from all affected licensees.

        (1) Affected licensees for the purposes of this section are licensees (and previously filed pending applicants) meeting both a spectral and a contour overlap as defined:

        (i)  Licensees (and filers of previously filed pending applications) with an assigned (or proposed) frequency having a spectral separation from a frequency of the proposed centralized trunked station that does not exceed these values:

        (ii)  (A) Licensees (and filers of previously filed pending applications) with a service contour (37 dBu for stations in the 150-174 MHz band, and 39 dBu for stations in the 421-512 MHz band) that is overlapped by the proposed centralized trunked station's interference contour (19 dBu for stations in the 150-174 MHz band, and 21 dBu for stations in the 421-512 MHz band). Contour calculations are required for base station facilities. Contour calculations are required for associated mobile stations only in the 150-174 MHz band, with the associated base station's service contour used as both the mobile station's service contour and its interference contour.

        (B) The calculation of service and interference contours shall be performed using generally accepted engineering practices and standards, including appropriate derating factors, agreed to by a consensus of all certified frequency coordinators. Frequency coordinators shall make this information available to the Commission upon request.

        (C) For purposes of this section, the authorized operating area of a station or proposed station with no associated base station shall be used as both the station's service contour and its interference contour.

        (D) After January 1, 2013, licensees with an authorized bandwidth exceeding 12.5 kHz will not be deemed affected licensees, unless the licensee meets the efficiency standard set forth in § 90.203(j)(3) or the licensee was granted a waiver of § 90.209(b).

        (2) The written consent from an affected licensee shall state all terms agreed to by the parties and shall be signed by the parties. The written consent shall be maintained by the operator of the centralized trunked station and be made available to the Commission upon request. An application for a centralized trunked station shall include either a certification from the applicant that written consent has been obtained from all affected licensees, or a certification from the frequency coordinator that there are no affected licensees.

        (3) In addition, the service contour for proposed centralized trunked stations on Industrial/Business Pool frequencies shall not be overlapped by an incumbent licensee's interference contour. An application filed for Public Safety Pool frequencies, see § 90.20, for a proposed centralized trunked station in which the service contour of the proposed station is overlapped by the interference contour of the incumbent station(s) is allowed, but the applicant must accept any resultant interference.

        (e) The exclusive service area of a station that has been authorized for centralized trunked operation will be protected from proposed centralized trunked, decentralized trunked or conventional operations in accordance with the standards of paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f) Trunking of systems licensed on paging-only channels or licensed in the Radiolocation Service (subpart F) is not permitted.

        (g)  (1) No more than 10 channels for new centralized trunked operation in the Industrial/Business Pool may be applied for at a single transmitter location or at locations with overlapping service contours as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Subsequent applications for centralized trunked operation are limited to no more than an additional 10 channels, and must be accompanied by a certification, submitted to the certified frequency coordinator coordinating the application, that all of the applicant's existing channels authorized for centralized trunked operation at that location or at locations with overlapping service contours have been constructed and placed in operation. Certified frequency coordinators are authorized to require documentation in support of the applicant's certification that existing channels have been constructed and placed in operation.

        (2) Applicants for Public Safety Pool channels may request more than 10 centralized trunked channels at a single location or at locations with overlapping service contours if accompanied by a showing of sufficient need. The requirement for such a showing may be satisfied by submission of loading studies demonstrating that requested channels in excess of 10 will be loaded with 50 mobiles per channel within a five year period commencing with the grant of the application.

        (h) If a licensee authorized for centralized trunked operation discontinues trunked operation for a period of 30 consecutive days, the licensee, within 7 days thereafter, shall file a conforming application for modification of license with the Commission.

        § 90.209   Bandwidth limitations.

#### § § 90.209

        (a) Each authorization issued to a station licensed under this part will show an emission designator representing the class of emission authorized. The designator will be prefixed by a specified necessary bandwidth. This number does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where § 2.202 of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth, as defined in part 2 of this chapter, may be used in lieu of the necessary bandwidth.

        (b) The maximum authorized single channel bandwidth of emission corresponding to the type of emission specified in § 90.207 is as follows:

        (1) For A1A or A1B emissions, the maximum authorized bandwidth is 0.25 kHz. The maximum authorized bandwidth for type A3E emission is 8 kHz.

        (2) For operations below 25 MHz utilizing J3E emission, the bandwidth occupied by the emission shall not exceed 3000 Hz. The assigned frequency will be specified in the authorization. The authorized carrier frequency will be 1400 Hz lower in frequency than the assigned frequency. Only upper sideband emission may be used. In the case of regularly available double sideband radiotelephone channels, an assigned frequency for J3E emissions is available either 1600 Hz below or 1400 Hz above the double sideband radiotelephone assigned frequency.

        (3) For all other types of emissions, the maximum authorized bandwidth shall not be more than that normally authorized for voice operations.

        (4) Where a frequency is assigned exclusively to a single licensee, more than a single emission may be used within the authorized bandwidth. In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of § 90.213 must be met for each emission.

        (5) Unless specified elsewhere, channel spacings and bandwidths that will be authorized in the following frequency bands are given in the following table.

        (6)(i) Beginning January 1, 2011, no new applications for the 150-174 MHz and/or 421-512 MHz bands will be acceptable for filing if the applicant utilizes channels with an authorized bandwidth exceeding 11.25 kHz, unless specified elsewhere or the operations meet the efficiency standards of § 90.203(j)(3).

        (ii) Beginning January 1, 2011, no modification applications for stations in the 150-174 MHz and/or 421-512 MHz bands that increase the station's authorized interference contour, will be acceptable for filing if the applicant utilizes channels with an authorized bandwidth exceeding 11.25 kHz, unless specified elsewhere or the operations meet the efficiency standards of § 90.203(j)(3). See § 90.187(b)(2)(iii) and (iv) for interference contour designations and calculations. Applications submitted pursuant to this paragraph must comply with frequency coordination requirements of § 90.175.

        (7) Economic Area (EA)-based licensees in frequencies 817-824/862-869 MHz (813.5-824/858.5-869 MHz in the counties listed in § 90.614(c)) may exceed the standard channel spacing and authorized bandwidth listed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section in any National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee Region when all 800 MHz public safety licensees in the Region have completed band reconfiguration consistent with this part. In any National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee Region where the 800 MHz band reconfiguration is incomplete, EA-based licensees in frequencies 817-821/862-866 MHz (813.5-821/858.5-866 MHz in the counties listed in § 90.614(c)) may exceed the standard channel spacing and authorized bandwidth listed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Upon all 800 MHz public safety licensees in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee Region completing band reconfiguration, EA-based 800 MHz SMR licensees in the 821-824/866-869 MHz band may exceed the channel spacing and authorized bandwidth in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Licensees authorized to exceed the standard channel spacing and authorized bandwidth under this paragraph must provide at least 30 days written notice prior to initiating such service in the bands listed herein to every 800 MHz public safety licensee with a base station in an affected National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee Region, and every 800 MHz public safety licensee with a base station within 113 kilometers (70 miles) of an affected National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee Region. Such notice shall include the estimated date upon which the EA-based 800 MHz SMR licensee intends to begin operations that exceed the channel spacing and authorized bandwidth in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (8) Applicants may begin to license 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth channels in the 809-817/854-862 MHz band segment only after the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau jointly release a public notice announcing the availability of those channels for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region.

#### § § 90.210

        Except as indicated elsewhere in this part, transmitters used in the radio services governed by this part must comply with the emission masks outlined in this section. Unless otherwise stated, per paragraphs (d)(4), (e)(4), and (o) of this section, measurements of emission power can be expressed in either peak or average values provided that emission powers are expressed with the same parameters used to specify the unmodulated transmitter carrier power. For transmitters that do not produce a full power unmodulated carrier, reference to the unmodulated transmitter carrier power refers to the total power contained in the channel bandwidth. Unless indicated elsewhere in this part, the table in this section specifies the emission masks for equipment operating under this part.

        (a)  For transmitters utilizing J3E emission, the carrier must be at least 40 dB below the peak envelope power and the power of emissions must be reduced below the output power (P in watts) of the transmitter as follows:

        (2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 150 percent, but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 dB.

        (3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log P dB.

        (b)  For transmitters that are equipped with an audio low-pass filter, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier power (P) as follows:

        (1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent, but not more than 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 25 dB.

        (2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent, but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 dB.

        (3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.

        (c)  For transmitters that are not equipped with an audio low-pass filter, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier output power (P) as follows:

        (i) For stations of point-to-point systems in the fixed service: −45 dBW/27 MHz.

        (ii) For stations in the mobile service: −60 dBW/27 MHz.

        (d)  For transmitters designed to operate with a 12.5 kHz channel bandwidth, any emission must be attenuated below the power (P) of the highest emission contained within the authorized bandwidth as follows:

        (1) On any frequency from the center of the authorized bandwidth f to 5.625 kHz removed from f: Zero dB.

        (2) On any frequency remove**d** from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f in kHz) of more than 5.625 kHz but no more than 12.5 kHz: At least 7.27(f−2.88 kHz) dB.

        (4) The reference level for showing compliance with the emission mask shall be established using a resolution bandwidth sufficiently wide (usually two or three times the channel bandwidth) to capture the true peak emission of the equipment under test. In order to show compliance with the emission mask up to and including 50 kHz removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, adjust the resolution bandwidth to 100 Hz with the measuring instrument in a peak hold mode. A sufficient number of sweeps must be measured to insure that the emission profile is developed. If video filtering is used, its bandwidth must not be less than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For emissions beyond 50 kHz from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, see paragraph (o) of this section. If it can be shown that use of the above instrumentation settings do not accurately represent the true interference potential of the equipment under test, an alternate procedure may be used provided prior Commission approval is obtained.

In order to show compliance with the emission mask up to and including 50 kHz removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, adjust the resolution bandwidth to 100 Hz with the measuring instrument in a peak hold mode. A sufficient number of sweeps must be measured to insure that the emission profile is developed. If video filtering is used, its bandwidth must not be less than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For emissions beyond 50 kHz from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, see paragraph (o) of this section. If it can be shown that use of the above instrumentation settings do not accurately represent the true interference potential of the equipment under test, an alternate procedure may be used provided prior Commission approval is obtained.

        (f)  For transmitters operating in the 220-222 MHz frequency band, any emission must be attenuated below the power (P) of the highest emission contained within the authorized bandwidth as follows:

        (1) On any fr*e*quency fr*o*m the center of the authorized bandwidth f to the edge of the authorized bandwidth f: Zero dB.

        (j)  For transmitters that are not equipped with an audio low-pass filter, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier power of the transmitter (P) as follows:

        (1) On any frequency remove**d** from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f in kHz) of more than 2.5 kHz, but no more than 6.25 kHz: At least 53 log (f/2.5) dB;

        (2) On any frequency remove**d** from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f in kHz) of more than 6.25 kHz, but no more than 9.5 kHz: At least 103 log (f/3.9) dB;

        (3) On any frequency remove**d** from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f in kHz) of more than 9.5 kHz: At least 157 log (f/5.3) dB, or 50 + 10 log (P) dB or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

        (k) —(1)  For transmitters authorized under subpart M to provide forward or reverse links in a multilateration system in the subbands 904-909.75 MHz, 921.75-927.25 MHz and 919.75-921.75 MHz, and which transmit an emission occupying more than 50 kHz bandwidth: in any 100 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the center of authorized sub-band(s) by more than 50 percent of the authorized bandwidth, the power of emissions shall be attenuated below the transmitter output power, as specified by the following equation, but in no case less than 31 dB:

        (2)  For LMS multilateration narrowband forward link transmitters operating in the 927.25-928 MHz frequency band the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter output power (P) in accordance with following schedule:

        (3)  For all other transmitters authorized under subpart M that operate in the 902-928 MHz band, the peak power of any emission shall be attenuated below the power of the highest emission contained within the licensee's sub-band in accordance with the following schedule:

        (i) On any frequency within the authorized bandwidth: Zero dB.

        (ii) On any frequency outside the licensee's sub-band edges: 55 + 10 log(P) dB, where (P) is the highest emission (watts) of the transmitter inside the licensee's sub-band.

        (4) In the 902-928 MHz band, the resolution bandwidth of the instrumentation used to measure the emission power shall be 100 kHz, except that, in regard to paragraph (2) of this section, a minimum spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth of 300 Hz shall be used for measurement center frequencies with 1 MHz of the edge of the authorized subband. The video filter bandwidth shall not be less than the resolution bandwidth.

        (5) Emission power shall be measured in peak values.

        (6) The LMS sub-band edges for non-multilateration systems for which emissions must be attenuated are 902.00, 904.00, 909.5 and 921.75 MHz.

        (l)  For low power transmitters (20 dBm or less) operating in the 4940-4990 MHz frequency band, the power spectral density of the emissions must be attenuated below the output power of the transmitter as follows:

        (1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between 0-45% of the authorized bandwidth (BW): 0 dB.

        (4) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between 55-100% of the authorized bandwidth: 20 + 31 log (% of (BW)/55) dB attenuation.

        (5) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between 100-150% of the authorized bandwidth: 28 + 68 log (% of (BW)/100) dB attenuation.

        (6) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency above 150% of the authorized bandwidth: 40 dB.

        (7) The zero dB reference is measured relative to the highest average power of the fundamental emission measured across the designated channel bandwidth using a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth of the fundamental emission and a video bandwidth of 30 kHz. The power spectral density is the power measured within the resolution bandwidth of the measurement device divided by the resolution bandwidth of the measurement device. Emission levels are also based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth.

        (m)  For high power transmitters (greater that 20 dBm) operating in the 4940-4990 MHz frequency band, the power spectral density of the emissions must be attenuated below the output power of the transmitter as follows:

        (1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between 0-45% of the authorized bandwidth (BW): 0 dB.

        (2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between 45-50% of the authorized bandwidth: 568 log (% of (BW)/45) dB.

        (6) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency between above 150% of the authorized bandwidth: 50 dB or 55 + 10 log (P) dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

        (7) The zero dB reference is measured relative to the highest average power of the fundamental emission measured across the designated channel bandwidth using a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth of the fundamental emission and a video bandwidth of 30 kHz. The power spectral density is the power measured within the resolution bandwidth of the measurement device divided by the resolution bandwidth of the measurement device. Emission levels are also based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth.

        (n)  Transmitters designed for operation under this part on frequencies other than listed in this section must meet the emission mask requirements of Emission Mask B. Equipment operating under this part on frequencies allocated to but shared with the Federal Government, must meet the applicable Federal Government technical standards.

        (o)  The reference level for showing compliance with the emission mask shall be established, except as indicated in §§ 90.210 (d), (e), and (k), using standard engineering practices for the modulation characteristic used by the equipment under test. When measuring emissions in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz bands the following procedures will apply. A sufficient number of sweeps must be measured to insure that the emission profile is developed. If video filtering is used, its bandwidth must not be less than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For frequencies more than 50 kHz removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth a resolution of at least 100 kHz must be used for frequencies below 1000 MHz. Above 1000 MHz the resolution bandwidth of the instrumentation must be at least 1 MHz. If it can be shown that use of the above instrumentation settings do not accurately represent the true interference potential of the equipment under test, then an alternate procedure may be used provided prior Commission approval is obtained.

        § 90.217   Exemption from technical standards.

#### § § 90.217

        Except as noted herein, transmitters used at stations licensed below 800 MHz on any frequency listed in subparts B and C of this part or licensed on a business category channel above 800 MHz which have an output power not exceeding 120 milliwatts are exempt from the technical requirements set out in this subpart, but must instead comply with the following:

        (a) For equipment designed to operate with a 25 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 40 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.

        (b) For equipment designed to operate with a 12.5 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 25 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.

        (c) For equipment designed to operate with a 6.25 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 12.5 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.

        § 90.219   Use of signal boosters.

#### § § 90.219

        This section contains technical and operational rules allowing the use of signal boosters in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services (PLMRS). Rules for signal booster operation in the Commercial Mobile Radio Services under part 90 are found in § 20.21 of this chapter.

        (a)  The definitions in this paragraph apply only to the rules in this section.

        A signal booster designed to retransmit signals on one or more specific channels. A signal booster is deemed to be a Class A signal booster if none of its passbands exceed 75 kHz.

        A signal booster designed to retransmit any signals within a wide frequency band. A signal booster is deemed to be a Class B signal booster if it has a passband that exceeds 75 kHz.

        All locations within the normal reliable operating range (service contour) of a PLMRS station.

        Install and/or initially adjust a signal booster.

        A network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure.

        Maintain operational control over, and responsibility for the proper functioning of, a signal booster.

        A device or system that automatically receives, amplifies, and retransmits signals from wireless stations into and out of building interiors, tunnels, shielded outdoor areas and other locations where these signals would otherwise be too weak for reliable communications. Signal booster systems may contain both Class A and Class B signal boosters as components.

        (b)  PLMRS licensees for stations operating on assigned channels higher than 150 MHz may operate signal boosters, limited to the service band for which they are authorized, as needed anywhere within the PLMRS stations' service contour, but may not extend the stations' service contour.

        (1) PLMRS licensees may also consent to operation of signal boosters by non-licensees (such as a building owner or a signal booster installation contractor) within their service contour and across their applicable frequencies, but must maintain a reasonable level of control over these operations in order to resolve interference problems.

        (i) Non-licensees seeking to operate signal boosters must obtain the express consent of the licensee(s) of the frequencies for which the device or system is intended to amplify. The consent must be maintained in a recordable format that can be presented to an FCC representative or other relevant licensee investigating interference.

        (ii) Consent is not required from third party (unintended) licensees whose signals are incidentally retransmitted. However, signal booster operation is on a non-interference basis and operations may be required to cease or alter the operating parameters due to a request from an FCC representative or a licensee's request to resolve interference.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (c)  PLMRS licensees that operate signal boosters are responsible for their proper operation, and are responsible for correcting any harmful interference that signal booster operation may cause to other licensed communications services. Normal co-channel transmissions are not considered to be harmful interference. Licensees are required to resolve interference problems pursuant to § 90.173(b). Licensees shall act in good faith regarding the operation of signal boosters and in the resolution of interference due to signal booster operation. Licensees who are unable to determine the location or cause of signal booster interference may seek assistance from the FCC to resolve such problems.

        (d)  Deployment of signal boosters must be carried out in accordance with the rules in this paragraph.

        (1) Signal boosters may be used to improve coverage in weak signal areas only.

        (2) Signal boosters must not be used to extend PLMRS stations' normal operating range.

        (3)(i) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, signal boosters must be deployed such that the radiated power of each retransmitted channel, on the forward link and on the reverse link, does not exceed 5 Watts effective radiated power (ERP).

        (ii) Railroad licensees may operate Class A signal boosters transmitting on a single channel with up to 30 Watts ERP on frequencies 452/457.9000 to 452/457.96875 MHz in areas where communication between the front and rear of trains is unsatisfactory due to distance or intervening terrain barriers.

        (4) Class B signal boosters may be deployed only at fixed locations; mobile operation of Class B signal boosters is prohibited after November 1, 2014.

        (5) Class B signal booster installations must be registered in the FCC signal booster database that can be accessed at the following URL:

        (6) Good engineering practice must be used in regard to the radiation of intermodulation products and noise, such that interference to licensed communications systems is avoided. In the event of harmful interference caused by any given deployment, the FCC may require additional attenuation or filtering of the emissions and/or noise from signal boosters or signal booster systems, as necessary to eliminate the interference.

        (i) In general, the ERP of intermodulation products should not exceed −30 dBm in 10 kHz measurement bandwidth.

        (ii) In general, the ERP of noise within the passband should not exceed −43 dBm in 10 kHz measurement bandwidth.

        (iii) In general, the ERP of noise on spectrum more than 1 MHz outside of the passband should not exceed −70 dBm in a 10 kHz measurement bandwidth.

        (7) Signal booster passbands are limited to the service band or bands for which the operator is authorized. In general, signal boosters should utilize the minimum passband that is sufficient to accomplish the purpose. Except for distributed antenna systems (DAS) installed in buildings, the passband of a Class B booster should not encompass both commercial services (such as ESMR and Cellular Radiotelephone) and part 90 Land Mobile and Public Safety Services.

        (e)  In addition to the general rules for equipment certification in § 90.203(a)(2) and part 2, subpart J of this chapter, a signal booster must also meet the rules in this paragraph.

        (1) The output power capability of a signal booster must be designed for deployments providing a radiated power not exceeding 5 Watts ERP for each retransmitted channel.

        (2) The noise figure of a signal booster must not exceed 9 dB in either direction.

        (3) Spurious emissions from a signal booster must not exceed −13 dBm within any 100 kHz measurement bandwidth.

        (4) A signal booster must be designed such that all signals that it retransmits meet the following requirements:

        (i) The signals are retransmitted on the same channels as received. Minor departures from the exact provider or reference frequencies of the input signals are allowed,  the retransmitted signals meet the requirements of § 90.213.

        (ii) There is no change in the occupied bandwidth of the retransmitted signals.

        (iii) The retransmitted signals continue to meet the unwanted emissions limits of § 90.210 applicable to the corresponding received signals (assuming that these received signals meet the applicable unwanted emissions limits by a reasonable margin).

        (5) On or after March 1, 2014, a signal booster must be labeled to indicate whether it is a Class A or Class B device, and the label must include the following advisory

        (1) In on-line point-of-sale marketing materials,

        (2) In any print or on-line owner's manual and installation instructions,

        (3) On the outside packaging of the device, and

        (4) On a label affixed to the device:

        “WARNING. This is NOT a CONSUMER device. It is designed for installation by FCC LICENSEES and QUALIFIED INSTALLERS. You MUST have an FCC LICENSE or express consent of an FCC Licensee to operate this device. You MUST register Class B signal boosters (as defined in 47 CFR 90.219) online at  Unauthorized use may result in significant forfeiture penalties, including penalties in excess of $100,000 for each continuing violation.”

        § 90.237   Interim provisions for operation of radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile devices.

#### § § 90.237

        These provisions authorize and govern the use of radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile devices for base station use (other than on mobile-only or paging-only frequencies) in all radio pools and services except Radiolocation in this part.

        (a) Information must be submitted with an application to establish that the minimum separation between a proposed radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile base station and the nearest co-channel base station of another licensee operating a voice system is 120 km (75 mi) for a single frequency mode of operation, or 56 km (35 mi) for two frequency mode of operation. Where this minimum mileage separation cannot be achieved, either agreement to the use of F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission must be received from all existing co-channel licensees using voice emission within the applicable mileage limits, or if agreement was not received, the licensee of the radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile system is responsible for eliminating any interference with preexisting voice operations. New licensees of voice operations will be expected to share equally any frequency occupied by established radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile operations.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) Transmitters certificated under this part for use of G3E or F3E emission may also be used for F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile, provided the keying signal is passed through the low pass audio frequency filter required for G3E or F3E emission. The transmitter must be so adjusted and operated that the instantaneous frequency deviation does not exceed the maximum value allowed for G3E or F3E.

        (d) Frequencies will not be assigned exclusively for F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile (except where specifically provided for in the frequency limitations).

        (e) The requirements in this part applicable to the use of G3E or F3E emission are also applicable to the use of F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile transmissions.

        (f) The station identification required by § 90.425 must be given by voice or Morse code.

        (g) For single sideband operations in accordance with § 90.266, transmitters certified under this part for use of J3E emission may also be used for A2B and F2B emissions for radioteleprinter transmissions. Transmitters certified under this part for use of J3E emission in accordance with §§ 90.35(c)(1)(A), 90.35(c)(1)(B), 90.35(c)(1)(C) and 90.257(a) may also be used for A1B, A2B, F1B, F2B, J2B, and A3C emissions to provide standby backup circuits for operational telecommunications circuits which have been disrupted, where so authorized in other sections of this part.

        (a)  (1) Control stations may be authorized to operate on frequencies available for use by operational fixed stations.

        (2) A control station associated with mobile relay station(s) may, at the option of the applicant, be assigned the frequency of the associated mobile station. In the Industrial/Business Pool, on frequencies designated with an “LR” in the coordinator column of the frequency table in § 90.35(b)(3), such a control station may be assigned any mobile service station frequency available for assignment to mobile stations. Such operation is on a secondary basis to use of the frequency for regular mobile service communications.

        (3) Control and fixed stations in the Public Safety Pool may be authorized on a temporary basis to operate on frequencies available for base and mobile stations between 152 and 450 MHz, where there is an adequate showing that such operations cannot be conducted on frequencies allocated for assignment to operational fixed stations. Such operation will not be authorized initially or renewed for periods in excess of one year. Any such authorization shall be subject to immediate termination if harmful interference is caused to stations in the mobile service, or if the particular frequency is required for mobile service operations in the area concerned.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) A base station which is used intermittently as a control station for one or more associated mobile relay stations of the same licensee shall operate only on the mobile service frequency assigned to the associated mobile relay station when operating as a base station and on the mobile service frequency assigned to the associated mobile station when operating as a control station. Authority for such dual classification and use must be shown on the station authorization. When operating as a control station, the licensee must meet all control station requirements. In the Industrial/Business Pool, on frequencies designated with an “LR” in the coordinator column of the frequency table in § 90.35(b)(3), base stations used intermittently as control stations shall operate only on a mobile service frequency which is available for assignment to base stations.

#### § § 90.255

        § 90.257   Assignment and use of frequencies in the band 72-76 MHz.

#### § § 90.257

        (a) The following criteria shall govern the authorization and use of frequencies within the band 72-76 MHz by fixed stations. (For call box operations see § 90.241).

        (1) The following frequencies in the band 72-76 MHz may be used for fixed operations:

        (2) All authorizations are subject to the condition that no harmful interference will be caused to television reception on Channels 4 and 5.

        (3) The applicant must agree to eliminate any harmful interference caused by his operation to TV reception on either Channel 4 or 5 that might develop by whatever means are necessary. Such action must be taken within 90 days of notification by the Commission. If such interference is not eliminated within the 90-day period, operation of the fixed station will be discontinued.

        (4) Vertical polarization must be used.

        (5) Whenever it is proposed to locate a 72-76 MHz fixed station less than 128 km (80 mi.) but more than 16 km (10 mi.) from the site of a TV transmitter operating on either channel 4 or 5, or from the post office of a community in which such channels are assigned but not in operation, the fixed station shall be authorized only if there are fewer than 100 family dwelling units (as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census), excluding units 112 or more km (70 mi.) distant from the TV antenna site, located within a circle centered at the location of the proposed fixed station. The radius shall be determined by use of the following chart entitled, “Chart for Determining Radius From Fixed Station in 72-76 MHz Band to Interference Contour Along Which 10 Percent of Service From Adjacent Channel Television Station Would Be Destroyed.” Two charts are available, one for Channel 4, and one for Channel 5. The Commission may, however, in a particular case, authorize the location of a fixed station within a circle containing 100 or more family dwelling units upon a showing that:

        (i) The proposed site is the only suitable location.

        (ii) It is not feasible, technically or otherwise, to use other available frequencies.

        (iii) The applicant has a plan to control any interference that might develop to TV reception from his operations.

        (iv) The applicant is financially able and agrees to make such adjustments in the TV receivers affected as may be necessary to eliminate any interference caused by his operations.

        (v) All applications seeking authority to operate with a separation of less than 16 km (10 mi.) will be returned without action.

        (b) The following criteria governs the authorization and use of frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band by mobile stations in the Industrial/Business Pool.

        (1) Mobile operation on frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band is subject to the condition that no interference is caused to the reception of television stations operating on Channel 4 or 5. Interference will be considered to occur whenever reception of a regularly used television signal is impaired by signals radiated by stations operating under these rules in the 72 to 76 MHz band regardless of the quality of such reception or the strength of the signal used. In order to minimize the hazard of such interference, it shall be the duty of the licensee to determine whether interference is being caused to television reception, wherever television receivers other than those under the control of the licensee, are located within 31 m. (100 ft.) of any point where the stations licensed under these rules may be operated. In any case, it shall be the responsibility of the licensee to correct, at its own expense, any such interference and if the interference cannot be eliminated by the application of suitable techniques, the operation of the offending transmitter shall be suspended. If the complainant refuses to permit the licensee to apply remedial techniques which demonstrably will eliminate the interference without impairment of the original reception, the licensee is absolved of further responsibility.

        (2) The maximum transmitter output power that will be authorized is 1 watt; and each station authorized will be classified and licensed as a mobile station. Any units of such a station, however, may be used to provide the operational functions of a base or fixed station. The antennas of transmitters operating on these frequencies must be directly mounted or installed upon the transmitting unit: Except that when permanently installed aboard a vehicle, antenna and transmitter may be separated as required for convenience in mounting. Horizontal polarization will not be allowed; and the gain of antennas employed shall not exceed that of a halfwave dipole. The maximum bandwidth that will be authorized is 20 kHz. Tone control transmissions are permitted.

        (c) Radio remote control of models is permitted on frequencies 10 kHz removed from these frequencies authorized for fixed and mobile operations in the 72-76 MHz band. Remote control operations are secondary to operation of fixed and mobile stations as provided for in this section.

        § 90.305   Location of stations.

#### § § 90.305

        (a) The transmitter site(s) for base station(s), including mobile relay stations, shall be located not more than 80 km. (50 mi.) from the geographic center of the urbanized area listed in § 90.303.

        (b) Mobile units shall be operated within 48 km. (30 mi.) of their associated base station or stations. Such units may not be operated aboard aircraft in flight except as provided for in § 90.315(i).

        (c) Control stations must be located within the area of operation of the mobile units.

        (d) Base and control stations shall be located a minimum of 1.6 km. (1 mi.) from local television stations operating on UHF TV channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 TV channels from the television channel in which the base station will operate.

        § 90.307   Protection criteria.

#### § § 90.307

        The tables and figures listed in § 90.309 shall be used to determine the effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height of the proposed land mobile base station and the ERP for the associated control station (control station antenna height shall not exceed 31 meters (100 feet) above average terrain (AAT)).

        (a) Base stations operating on the frequencies available for land mobile use in any urbanized area and having an antenna height (AAT) less than 152 meters (500 feet) shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel television stations in accordance with the values set out in tables A and E of § 90.309, except for channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be in accordance with the values set forth in tables B and E in 47 CFR 90.309.

        (b) For base stations having antenna heights between 152 and 914 meters (500-3000 feet) above average terrain, the effective radiated power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the power reduction graph in Figure A in § 90.309, except for channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where the effective radiated power must be reduced in accordance with Figure B in § 90.309. For heights of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain, the distance to the radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to the Grade B contour of a co-channel TV station (Grade B contour defined in § 73.683(a) of this chapter), an authorization will not be granted unless it can be shown that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the desired protection at the Grade B contour, or that the effective radiated power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation, the desired protection at the Grade B contour will be achieved.

        (c) Mobile units and control stations operating on the frequencies available for land mobile use in any given urbanized area shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel television stations in accordance with the values set forth in table C in § 90.309 and paragraph (d) of this section except for channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be in accordance with the values set forth in table D in § 90.309 and paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d) The minimum distance between a land mobile base station which has associated mobile units and a protected adjacent channel television station is 145 km (90 miles).

        (e) The television stations to be protected (co-channel, adjacent channel, IM, and IF) in any given urbanized area, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, are identified in the Commission's publication “TV stations to be considered in the preparation of Applications for Land Mobile Facilities in the Band 470-512 MHz.” The publication is available at the offices of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, DC or upon the request of interested persons.

        § 90.309   Tables and figures.

#### § § 90.309

        (a)  (1) Using the method specified in § 1.958 of this chapter, determine the distances between the proposed land mobile base station and the protected co-channel television station and between the proposed land mobile base station and the protected adjacent channel television station. If the exact mileage does not appear in table A for protected co-channel television stations (or table B for channel 15 in New York and Cleveland and channel 16 in Detroit) or table E for protected adjacent channel television stations, the next lower mileage separation figure is to be used.

        (2) Entering the proper table at the mileage figure found in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, find opposite, a selection of powers that may be used for antenna heights ranging from 15 m (50 ft) to 152.5 m (500 ft) (AAT). If the exact antenna height proposed for the land mobile base station does not appear in the proper table, use the power figure beneath the next greater antenna height.

        (3) The lowest power found using the tables mentioned in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section is the maximum power that may be employed by the proposed land mobile base station.

        (4) In determining the average elevation of the terrain, the elevations between 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) and 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the antenna site are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for a minimum of eight radials beginning at the antenna site and extending 16 kilometers (10 miles). The radials should be drawn starting with true north. At least one radial should be constructed in the direction of the nearest co-channel and adjacent channel UHF television stations. The profile graph for each radial shall be plotted by contour intervals of from 12.2 meters (40 feet) to 30.5 meters (100 feet) and, where the data permits, at least 50 points of elevation (generally uniformly spaced) should be used for each radial. For very rugged terrain, 61 meters (200 feet) to 122 meters (400 foot) contour intervals may be used. Where the terrain is uniform or gently sloping, the smallest contour interval indicated on the topographic chart may be used. The average elevation of the 12.8 kilometer (8 mile) distance between 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) and 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the antenna site should be determined from the profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained by averaging a large number of equally spaced points, by using a planimeter, or by obtaining the median elevation (that exceeded by 50 percent of the distance) in sectors and averaging those values. In the preparation of the profile graphs, the elevation or contour intervals may be taken from U.S. Geological Survey Topographic Maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Maps, or Tennessee Valley Authority Maps. Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or larger (such as 1:24,000) shall be used. Digital Terrain Data Tapes, provided by the National Cartographic Institute, U.S. Geologic Survey, may be utilized in lieu of maps, but the number of data points must be equal to or exceed that specified above. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the next best topographic information should be used.

        (5) Applicants for base stations in the Miami, FL, urbanized area may, in lieu of calculating the height of average terrain, use 3 m (10 ft) as the average terrain height.

        (b)  (1) Determine antenna height above average terrain. (According to § 90.309(a)(4).)

        (2) Locate this value on the antenna height axis.

        (3) Determine the separation between the LM antenna site and the nearest protected co-channel TV station. (According to § 73.611.)

        (4) Draw a vertical line to intersect the LM/TV separation curve at the distance determined in step 3 above. For distances not shown in the graph use linear interpolation.

        (5) From the intersection of the LM/TV separation curve draw a horizontal line to the power reduction scale.

        (6) The power reduction in dB determines the reduction below 1 kW that must be achieved.

        (7) See table F for dB/power equivalents.

The first and last assignable frequencies are shown. Assignable frequencies occur in increments of 6.25 kHz. The separation between base and mobile transmit frequencies is 3 MHz for two frequency operation.

        (1) Channel availability in the General Access Pool in any of the urbanized areas referred to in the table depends on whether that channel is presently assigned to one of the following categories of users:

        (i) Public safety (as defined in § 90.20(a));

        (ii) Power and telephone maintenance licensees (as defined in § 90.7);

        (iii) Special industrial licensees (as defined in § 90.7);

        (iv) Business licensees (as defined in § 90.35(a));

        (v) Petroleum, forest products, and manufacturers licensees (as defined in § 90.7);

        (vi) Railroad, motor carrier, and automobile emergency licensees (as defined in § 90.7); and

        (vii) Taxicab licensees (as defined in § 90.7).

        (2) If assigned, subsequent authorizations will only be granted to users from the same category. If unassigned, or should a channel subsequently become unassigned, it will be treated as available in the General Access Pool.

        (3) Normally, each channel should be substantially loaded in accordance with the standards set out in § 90.313.

        (4) The following frequencies will be authorized a maximum bandwidth of 6 kHz.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 90.313   Frequency loading criteria.

#### § § 90.313

        (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the maximum channel loading on frequencies in the 470-512 MHz band is as follows:

        (1) 50 units for systems eligible in the Public Safety Pool (see § 90.20(a)).

        (2) 90 units for systems eligible in the Industrial/Business Pool (see § 90.35(a)).

        (b) If a licensee has exclusive use of a frequency, then the loading standards in paragraph (a) of this section, may be exceeded. If it is a shared channel, the loading standards can be exceeded upon submission of a signed statement by all those sharing the channel agreeing to the increase.

        (c) A unit is defined as a mobile transmitter-receiver. Loading standards will be applied in terms of the number of units actually in use or to be placed in use within 8 months following authorization. A licensee will be required to show that an assigned frequency pair is at full capacity before it may be assigned a second or additional frequency pair. Channel capacity may be reached either by the requirements of a single licensee or by several users sharing a channel. Until a channel is loaded to capacity it will be available for assignment to other users in the same area. A frequency pair may be reassigned at distances 64 km. (40 mi.), 32 km. (20 mi.) for Channel 15, Chicago; Channel 20, Philadelphia; and Channel 17, Washington, or more from the location of base stations authorized on that pair without reference to loading at the point of original installation. Following authorization, the licensee shall notify the Commission either during or at the close of the 8 month period of the number of units in operation. In the Industrial Radio Services, if the base station facility is to be used by more than a single licensee, the frequency assigned to it will not be reassigned for use by another facility within 64 km. (40 mi.) or 32 km. (20 mi.) where applicable for a period of 12 months,  That the facility is constructed within 90 days from the date of the first grant, meets the loading standards to at least 50 percent within 9 months, and meets all loading standards within 12 months.

Where two EIRP limits are given, the higher limit is permitted only for state or local governmental entities.

          (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, non-reserve DSRCS channels are available on a shared basis only for use in accordance with the Commission's rules. All licensees shall cooperate in the selection and use of channels in order to reduce interference. This includes monitoring for communications in progress and any other measures as may be necessary to minimize interference. Licensees of RSUs suffering or causing harmful interference within a communications zone are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height and direction, additional filtering, or area or hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further the use of any channel at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the judgment of the Commission, its use at that location is not in the public interest; use of any such channel may be restricted as to specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.

          (d)  The following access priority governs all DSRCS operations:

          (1) Communications involving the safety of life have access priority over all other DSRCS communications;

          (2) Subject to a control channel priority system management strategy ( ASTM E2213-03 DSRC Standard at § 4.1.1.2(4)), DSRCS communications involving public safety have access priority over all other DSRC communications not listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Roadside Units (RSUs) operated by state or local governmental entities are presumptively engaged in public safety priority communications.

          (e)  DSRCS communications not listed in paragraph (d) of this section, are non-priority communications. If a dispute arises concerning non-priority communications, the licen_see_ of the later-registered RSU must accommodate the operation of the early registered RSU, , interference protection rights are date-sensitive, based on the date that the RSU is first registered ( § 90.375) and the later-registered RSU must modify its operations to resolve the dispute in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

          (f) Except as otherwise provided in the ASTM-DSRC Standard ( § 90.379) for the purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, objectionable interference will be considered to exist when the Commission receives a complaint and the difference in signal strength between the earlier-registered RSU and the later-registered RSU (anywhere within the earlier-registered RSU's communication zone) is 18 dB or less (co-channel). Later-registered RSUs causing objectionable interference must correct the interference immediately unless written consent is obtained from the licen_see_ of the earlier-registered RSU.

#### § § 90.353

        LMS systems may be authorized within the 902-928 MHz band, subject to the conditions in this section. LMS licensees are required to maintain whatever records are necessary to demonstrate compliance with these provisions and must make these records available to the Commission upon request:

        (a) LMS operations will not cause interference to and must tolerate interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) devices and radiolocation Government stations that operate in the 902-928 MHz band.

        (b) LMS systems are authorized to transmit status and instructional messages, either voice or non-voice, so long as they are related to the location or monitoring functions of the system.

        (c) LMS systems may utilize store and forward interconnection, where either transmissions from a vehicle or object being monitored are stored by the LMS provider for later transmission over the public switched network (PSN), or transmissions received by the LMS provider from the PSN are stored for later transmission to the vehicle or object being monitored. Real-time interconnection between vehicles or objects being monitored and the PSN will only be permitted to enable emergency communications related to a vehicle or a passenger in a vehicle. Such real-time, interconnected communications may only be sent to or received from a system dispatch point or entities eligible in the Public Safety or Special Emergency Radio Services.  subparts B and C of this part.

        (d) Multilateration LMS systems will be authorized on a primary basis within the bands 904-909.75 MHz and 921.75-927.25 MHz. Additionally, multilateration and non-multilateration systems will share the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-equal basis. Licensing will be on the basis of Economic Areas (EAs) for multilateration systems, with one exclusive EA license being issued for each of these three sub-bands. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, multilateration EA licensees may be authorized to operate on only one of the three multilateration bands within a given EA. Additionally, EA multilateration LMS licenses will be conditioned upon the licensee's ability to demonstrate through actual field tests that their systems do not cause unacceptable levels of interference to 47 CFR part 15 devices.

        (e) Multilateration EA-licensed systems and grandfathered automatic vehicle monitoring service (AVM) systems ( § 90.363) are authorized on a shared basis and must cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies in accordance with § 90.173(b).

        (f) Multilateration EA licen_see_s may be authorized to operate on both the 919.75-921.75 MHz and 921.75-927.75 MHz bands within a given EA ( § 90.209(b)(5)).

        (g) Multilateration LMS systems whose primary operations involve the provision of vehicle location services, may provide non-vehicular location services.

        (h) Non-multilateration stations are authorized to operate on a shared, non-exclusive basis in the 902-904 MHz and 909.75-921.75 MHz sub-bands. Non-multilateration systems and multilateration systems will share the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-equal basis. Non-multilateration LMS systems may not provide non-vehicular location services. The maximum antenna height above ground for non-multilateration LMS systems is 15 meters.

        (i) Non-multilateration LMS licenses will be issued on a site-by-site basis, except that municipalities or other governmental operatives may file jointly for a non-multilateration license covering a given U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis Economic Area (EA). Such an application must identify all planned sites. After receiving the license, the non-multilateration EA licensee must notify the Commission if sites are deleted or if new sites are added, before those sites may be put into operation.

        § 90.355   LMS operations below 512 MHz.

#### § § 90.355

        Applications requiring not more than 25 kHz bandwidth per frequency in the 25-50 MHz, 150-170 MHz, and 450-512 MHz bands may use either base-mobile frequencies currently assigned the applicant, or be assigned base-mobile frequencies available in the service in which eligibility has been established, provided that:

        (a) For transmission between vehicles and base stations, each frequency in a single-frequency mode of operation will provide location data for approximately 200 vehicles, or both frequencies in a two-frequency mode of operation will provide location data for approximately 400 vehicles, except that for frequencies in the 450-512 MHz band that are assigned in pairs in accordance with the allocation plan for the band, the requirement is that location data be provided for approximately 200 vehicles for each frequency pair; and a showing is made that 50 percent of the vehicles will be in operation within the system by the end of the second year of the initial license term, and 70 percent will be in operation within the system by the end of the initial license term; except that if these vehicle loading standards will not be met, frequencies will be assigned only on a secondary non-interference basis to any authorized radiotelephony operation.

        (b) The minimum separation between a proposed LMS station and the nearest co-channel base station of another licensee operating a voice system is 75 miles (120 km) for a single frequency mode of operation or 35 miles (56 km) for a two-frequency mode of operation. Where the minimum mileage separation cannot be achieved, agreement to the use of F1D, F2D, G1D, G2D or P0N emission must be received from all existing co-channel licensees using voice emissions within the applicable mileage limits. If there is interference with voice operations and required agreement was not received, or operation was authorized on a secondary non-interference basis, the licensee of the LMS system is responsible for eliminating the interference.

        (c) Frequencies additional to any assigned under paragraph (a) of this section will not be assigned to the same licensee at any stations located within 64 km (40 miles) of any station in which the licensee holds an interest until each of such licensee's frequencies for LMS operation is shown to accommodate not less than 90 percent of the frequency loading requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

#### § § 90.419

        Normally, operations licensed under this part are intended to provide intrastation mobile communications. For example, a base station is intended to communicate with its associated mobile stations and mobile stations are intended to communicate between associated mobile stations and associated base stations of the licensee. Accordingly, operations between base stations at fixed locations are permitted only in the following situations:

        (a) Base stations licensed under subpart T of this part and those in the Public Safety Pool that operate on frequencies below 450 MHz, may communicate on a secondary basis with other base stations, operational fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in these services or pools.

        (b) Base stations licensed on any frequency in the Industrial/Business Pool and on base stations frequencies above 450 MHz in the Public Safety Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with other base stations, operational fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in these pools only when:

        (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to mobile stations; or

        (2) Wireline communications facilities between such points are inoperative, economically impracticable, or unavailable from communications common carrier sources. Temporary unavailability due to a busy wireline circuit is not considered to be within the provisions of this paragraph.

        (c) Operational fixed stations may communicate with units of associated mobile stations only on a secondary basis.

        (d) Operational fixed stations licensed in the Industrial/Business Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with associated base stations licensed in these services when:

        (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to mobile stations; or

        (2) Wireline communications facilities between such points are inoperative, economically impracticable, or unavailable from communications common carrier sources. Temporary unavailability due to a busy wireline circuit is not considered to be within the provisions of this paragraph.

        (e) Travelers' Information Stations are authorized to transmit certain information to members of the traveling public (see § 90.242).

        (f) CMRS licensees in the SMR categories of part 90, subpart S, CMRS providers authorized in the 220 MHz service of part 90, subpart T, CMRS paging operations as defined by part 90, subpart P and for-profit interconnected business radio services with eligibility defined by § 90.35 are permitted to utilize their assigned spectrum for fixed services on a co-primary basis with their mobile operations.

        § 90.421   Operation of mobile station units not under the control of the licensee.

#### § § 90.421

        Mobile stations, as defined in § 90.7, include vehicular-mounted and hand-held units. Such units may be operated by persons other than the licensee, as provided for below, when necessary for the licensee to meet its requirements in connection with the activities for which it is licensed. If the number of such units, together with units operated by the licensee, exceeds the number of mobile units authorized to the licensee, license modification is required. The licensee is responsible for taking necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized operation of such units not under its control.

        (a)  (1) Mobile units licensed in the Public Safety Pool may be installed in any vehicle which in an emergency would require cooperation and coordination with the licensee, and in any vehicle used in the performance, under contract, of official activities of the licensee. This provision does not permit the installation of radio units in non-emergency vehicles that are not performing governmental functions under contract but with which the licensee might wish to communicate.

        (2) Mobile units licensed under § 90.20(a)(2)(iii) may be installed in a vehicle or be hand-carried for use by any person with whom cooperation or coordinations is required for medical services activities.

        (3) On the Interoperability Channels in the 700 MHz Public Safety Band ( § 90.531(b)(1)), hand-held and vehicular transmitters may be operated by any licensee holding a license in the 700 MHz Public Safety Band or by any licensee holding a license for any other public safety frequency pursuant to part 90 of the Commission's rules. Therefore, individual licenses are not required for hand-held and vehicular transmitters in the 700 MHz Band.

        (b)  Mobile units licensed in the Industrial/Business Pool may be installed in vehicles of persons furnishing under contract to the licensee and for the duration of the contract, a facility or service directly related to the activities of the licensee.

        (c) In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, frequencies assigned to licensees in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services may be installed in the facilities of those who assist the licensee in emergencies and with whom the licensee must communicate in situations involving imminent safety to life or property.

        § 90.423   Operation on board aircraft.

#### § § 90.423

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and except as may be provided in other sections of this part with respect to operation on specific frequencies, mobile stations first authorized after September 14, 1973, under this part may be operated aboard aircraft for air-to-mobile, air-to-base, air-to-air and air-to-ship communications subject to the following:

        (1) Operations are limited to aircraft that are regularly flown at altitudes below 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface;

        (2) Transmitters are to operate with an output power not to exceed ten watts;

        (3) Operations are secondary to land-based systems;

        (4) Such other conditions, including additional reductions of altitude and power limitations, as may be required to minimize the interference potential to land-based systems.

        (b) Exceptions to the altitude and power limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be authorized upon a showing of unusual operational requirements which justify departure from those standards, provided that the interference potential to regular land-based operations would not be increased.

        (c) Mobile operations aboard aircraft in the services governed by this part, under licenses in effect September 14, 1973, may be continued without regard to provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:

        (1) Operations may be continued only for the balance of the term of such licenses if aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes greater than 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.

        (2) Operations may be continued for one additional renewal license term if the aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes below 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.

        (d) Operation of radiolocation mobile stations may be authorized without regard to limitations and conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

        § 90.425   Station identification.

#### § § 90.425

        Stations licensed under this part shall transmit identification in accordance with the following provisions:

        (a)  Except as provided for in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each station or system shall be identified by the transmission of the assigned call sign during each transmission or exchange of transmissions, or once each 15 minutes (30 minutes in the Public Safety Pool) during periods of continuous operation. The call sign shall be transmitted by voice in the English language or by International Morse Code in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If the station is employing either analog or digital voice scrambling, or non-voice emission, transmission of the required identification shall be in the unscrambled mode using A3E, F3E or G3E emission, or International Morse, with all encoding disabled. Permissible alternative identification procedures are as follows:

        (1) A mobile relay stations call sign may be used to identify the associated control and mobile stations, except in the Public Safety Pool where the stations operate on frequencies below 450 MHz. Alternatively, a base station (including a mobile relay station) which is controlled by radio may be identified by the transmission of the call sign of the station at which communications originate.

        (2) One or more fixed relay stations may be identified by the transmission of the call signs of the stations at which the communications originate.

        (3) When a mobile station transmits on a different frequency than its associated base station, the assigned call sign of either the mobile station or the base station may be transmitted. Further, a single mobile unit in the licensee's authorized geographic area of operation may transmit station identification on behalf of any other operating mobile units in the fleet.

        (4)  (i) In the Public Safety Pool, mobile units licensed to a governmental entity and which operate on frequencies above 30 MHz may use an identifier which contains, at a minimum, the name of the licensee if the licensee maintains at the station a list of the special identifiers to be used by the mobile units.

        (ii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, licensees may request the Commission's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to approve the use of special mobile unit identifiers in lieu of the assigned call sign. Such requests, however, will not be granted where it appears that harmful interference to international operations may be caused by stations below 50 MHz, or by stations operating in areas within 80 km (50 miles) of an international boundary, or where it appears that the proposed method of identification will not adequately distinguish the mobile units of the applicant from the mobile units of other licensees in the area.

        (iii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, railroad licensees (as defined in § 90.7) may identify stations by the name of the railroad and the train number, caboose number, engine number, or the name of the fixed wayside station. If none of these forms is practicable, any similar name or number may be designated by the railroad concerned for use by its employees in the identification of fixed points or mobile units, provided that a list of such identifiers is maintained by the railroad. An abbreviated name or the initials of the railroad may be used where such are in general usage. In those areas where it is shown that no difficulty would be encountered in identifying the transmission of a particular station (as, for example, where stations of one licensee are located in a yard isolated from other radio installations), approval may be given to a request from the licensee for permission to omit the station identification.

        (5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the transmission of station or unit identifiers which may be necessary or desirable for system operation, provided that they are transmitted in addition to the assigned station call sign or other permissible form of identification.

        (b)  Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station identification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following conditions:

        (1) The signal output of the automatic identification equipment shall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any other manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted to produce 40 percent ±10 percent of the maximum permissible modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be performed when all other modulating signals are absent.

        (2) The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20 and 25 words per minute.

        (3) The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification signal shall be 1200 ±800 Hz. A licensee may be required to change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the operations of another co-channel licensee.

        (4) Should activation of automatic Morse code identification equipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee, the Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay automatic station identification until such co-channel communications are completed.

        (c)  (1) Stations in the Radiolocation Service are not required to identify except upon special instructions from the Commission or as required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.

        (2) Stations in the Radiolocation Service operating on frequencies above 3400 kHz that employ spread spectrum techniques shall transmit a two letter manufacturer's designator, authorized by the Commission on the station authorization, at the beginning and ending of each transmission and once every 15 minutes during periods of continuing operation. The designator shall be transmitted in International Morse Code at a speed not exceeding 25 words per minute, and the spread spectrum mode of operation shall be maintained while the designator is being transmitted. The identifying signal shall be clearly receivable in the demodulated audio of a narrow-band FM receiver.

        (3) Oceanographic radars operating in the bands shown in section 90.103(b) shall transmit a station identification (call sign) on the assigned frequency, in international Morse code at a transmission rate in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section at the end of each data acquisition cycle, but at an interval of no more than 20 minutes.

        (d)  A station need not transmit identification if:

        (1) It is a mobile station operating on the transmitting frequency of the associated base station.

        (2) It is a mobile station in the Public Safety Pool using F1E or G1E emission.

        (3) It is transmitting for telemetering purposes or for the activation of devices which are employed solely as a means of attracting attention, or for remote control purposes, or which is retransmitting by self-actuating means, a radio signal received from another radio station or stations.

        (4) It is any type of radiopositioning or radar station authorized in a service other than the Radiolocation Service.

        (5) It is used solely for automatic vehicle monitoring or location.

        (6) It is a paging station authorized in accordance with the provisions of § 90.20(a)(2)(v).

        (7) It is a mobile station employing non-voice emissions and the associated base station identifies on behalf of the mobile unit(s).

        (8) It is a base or mobile station in the 220-222 MHz band authorized to operate on a nationwide basis in accordance with subpart T of this part.

        (9) It is a wireless microphone station operating in accordance with the provisions of § 90.265(b).

        (10) It is a Roadside Unit in a DSRCS system.

        (e) Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that are classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.

        (1) Station identification will not be required for 929-930 MHz nationwide paging licensees or MTA or EA-based SMR licensees. All other CMRS stations will be required to comply with the station identification requirements of this paragraph.

        (2) CMRS stations subject to a station identification requirement will be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned facilities that are operated as part of a single system. The call sign must be transmitted each hour within five minutes of the hour, or upon completion of the first transmission after the hour.

        (3) CMRS stations granted exclusive channels may transmit their call signs digitally. A licensee that identifies its call sign in this manner must provide the Commission, upon request, information sufficient to decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.

        (f) Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that are not classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.

        (1) Stations subject to a station identification requirement will be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned facilities that are operated as part of a single system.

        (2) Stations licensed on an exclusive basis in the bands between 150 and 512 MHz that normally employ digital signals for the transmission of data, text, control codes, or digitized voice may be identified by digital transmission of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its call sign in this manner must provide the Commission, upon request, information sufficient to decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.

#### § § 90.475

          (a) An internal transmitter control system need not be designed to meet the requirements of § 90.473 if it meets the following requirements:

          (1) All operating positions must be located on premises controlled by the licensee.

          (2) An internal transmitter control system may be used in conjunction with other approved methods of transmitter control and interconnection so long as the internal transmitter control system, itself, is neither accessed from telephone positions in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), nor uses dial-up circuits in the PSTN. Licensees with complex communications systems involving fixed systems whose base stations are controlled by such systems may automatically access these base stations through the microwave or operational fixed systems from positions in the PSTN, so long as the base stations and mobile units meet the requirements of § 90.483 and if a separate circuit is provided for each mode of transmitter operation (, conventional, dial-up or Internet).

          (3) The system must be designed so that upon completion of a transmission, the base station transmitter(s) will close down automatically within 3 seconds.

          (4) To guard against malfunctions, the system must also be designed so that the base station(s) will be deactivated by an automatic timing device when a modulated signal is not transmitted for a period of three (3) consecutive minutes.

          (5) The system must include automatic monitoring equipment, installed at the base station transmitter site(s), which will prevent the activation of the system when signals of other co-channel stations are present.

          § 90.477   Interconnected systems.

#### § § 90.477

          (a) Applicants for new land stations to be interconnected with the public switched telephone network must indicate on their applications (class of station code) that their stations will be interconnected. Licensees of land stations that are not interconnected may interconnect their stations with the public switched telephone network only after modifying their license.  § 1.929 of this chapter. In all cases a detailed description of how interconnection is accomplished must be maintained by licensees as part of their station records. _See_ § 90.433 of this part.

          (b) In the frequency ranges 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, and 935-940 MHz, interconnection with the public switched telephone network is authorized under the following conditions:

          (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.

          (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the use.

          (c) Interconnection of facilities in the Radiolocation Service (subpart F) will not be permitted.

          (d) In the frequency ranges below 800 MHz, interconnection with the public switched telephone network is authorized under the following conditions:

          (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.

          (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the use.

          (3) For licensees in the Industrial/Business Pool and those licensees who establish eligibility pursuant to § 90.20(a)(2) of this part, except for §§ 90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this part and medical emergency systems in the 450-470 MHz band, interconnection will be permitted only where the base station site or sites proposed stations are located 120 km (75 mi.) or more from the designated centers of the urbanized areas listed below. If these licensees seek to connect within 120 km (75 mi.) of the 25 cities, they must obtain the consent of all co-channel licensees located both within 120 km (75 mi.) of the center of the city; and within 120 km (75 mi.) of the interconnected base station transmitter. The consensual agreements among the co-channel licensees must specifically state the terms agreed upon and a statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to the use of interconnection. If a licensee has agreed to the use of interconnection on the channel, but later decides against the use of interconnection, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of interconnection. If the licensee is unable to reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed to the use of interconnection and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of interconnection. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees it may request that the Commission reassign it to another channel.

          (e) Additional frequencies shall not be assigned to enable any licensee to employ a preferred interconnection capability.

          (f) Paging systems operating on frequencies in the bands below 800 MHz are not subject to the interconnection provisions of § 90.477(d)(3).

          § 90.483   Permissible methods and requirements of interconnecting private and public systems of communications.

#### § § 90.483

          Interconnection may be accomplished by commercial mobile service providers licensed under this part by any technically feasible means. Interconnection may be accomplished by private mobile service providers either manually or automatically under the supervision and control of a transmitter control operator at a fixed position in the authorized system of communications or it may be accomplished under the supervision and control of mobile operators, and is subject to the following provisions:

          (a) Where a system is interconnected manually at a fixed control point, the control point operator must maintain the capability to turn the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system completely when circumstances warrant such action.

          (b) When the system is interconnected automatically it may be supervised at the control point or in mobile units.

          (1) For control point supervision, the following is required:

          (i) The control point operator must maintain the capability to turn the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system completely when circumstances warrant such action.

          (ii) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic monitoring equipment must be installed at the base station to prevent activation of the transmitter when signals of co-channel stations are present and activation would interfere with communications in progress. Licensees may operate without the monitoring equipment if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 kilometer (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems on frequencies above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.

          (2) For mobile unit supervision, the following is required:

          (i) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic monitoring equipment must be installed at the base station to prevent activation of the transmitter when signals of co-channel stations are present and activation would interfere with communications in progress. Licensees may operate without this equipment if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 kilometer (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems on frequencies above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.

          (ii) Initial access points within the public switched telephone network must be limited to transmission of a 3-second tone, after which time the transmitter shall close down. No additional signals may be transmitted until acknowledgement from a mobile station of the licensee is received. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 kilometer (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems on frequencies above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.

          (c) In single frequency systems, equipment must be installed at the base station which will limit any single transmission from within the public switched telephone network to 30 seconds duration and which in turn will activate the base station receiver to monitor the frequency for a period of not less than three (3) seconds. The mobile station must be capable of terminating the communications during the three (3) seconds. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission.

          (d) A timer must be installed at the base station transmitter which limits communications to three (3) minutes. After three (3) minutes, the system must close down, with all circuits between the base station and the public switch telephone network disconnected. This provision does not apply to systems which establish eligibility pursuant to §§ 90.20(a)(1)(i), 90.20(a)(1)(ii), and 90.20(a)(2), except §§ 90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii), or who are Power, Petroleum, or Railroad licensees (as defined in § 90.7), or to systems above 800 MHz. All systems must be equipped with a timer that closes down the transmitter within three minutes of the last transmission. Licensees may operate without these requirements if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission.

        § 90.460   Scope.

#### § § 90.460

        This subpart sets forth the provisions relating to permissible methods of transmitter control and interconnection (see the definition in § 90.7) of radio systems authorized under this part.

> [44 FR 67124, Nov. 23, 1979, as amended at 62 FR 18934, Apr. 17, 1997]

        § 90.461   Direct and remote control of transmitters.

#### § § 90.461

        (a)  Radio transmitters may be operated and controlled directly (as when the operating position for the transmitter and the transmitter being operated are at the same location), or remotely (as when the transmitter being operated and the position from which it is being operated are at different locations).

        (b)  Radio transmitters at remote locations may be operated and controlled through the use of wire line or radio links; or through dial-up circuits, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Such control links or circuits may be either those of the licensee or they may be provided by common carriers authorized by law to furnish such service.

        (c)  Dial-up circuits may be provided by wire line telephone companies under appropriate tariffs, and they may be used by licensees for purposes of transmitter control, provided:

        (1) The dial-up circuits serve only to link licensed transmitter control points and the transmitters being controlled.

        (2) The dial-up circuits are so designed that the transmitters being controlled cannot be operated from any fixed position other than the licensed control points for those transmitters.

        (3) Equipment used to provide the transmitter/dial-up-circuit interface is designed to preclude associated mobile units of the licensee from reaching any point(s) served by the wire line telephone facilities other than the control point(s) of the station(s) controlled.

        (4) Any direct electrical connection to the telephone network shall comply with applicable tariffs and with part 68 of the Commission's Rules (See § 90.5(j)).

        (5) Interconnection, within the meaning of §§ 90.7 and 90.477 through 90.483, may not take place at a control point which connects to its associated transmitter(s) through dial-up circuits; nor may such dial-up transmitter control circuits be used in conjunction with (or shared by) interconnection equipment.

        § 90.463   Transmitter control points.

#### § § 90.463

        (a) A control operator is required to be stationed at the operating position of a transmitter control point. A control operator is any person designated by the licensee to exercise supervision and control over the operation and use of the licensee's facilities. The control operator may be the licensee; or an employee of the licensee; or the agent of the licensee, appointed by the licensee to act as the control operator; or a third-party contractor, engaged by the licensee to serve as the control operator:  In no case, through appointment or designation of any person to serve as control operator, may the licensee delegate any of the duties and responsibilities the licensee may have in his capacity as licensee.

        (b) Each station or licensed system of communication shall normally have a control point, or control points, at which the control operator or operators are stationed and at or from which the licensee may exercise supervision and control over the authorized facilities, as required by the provisions of § 90.461.  Control point requirements may vary from one system to another, depending upon the nature of the radio operation; the way and by whom the facilities are employed; and other factors, as set out in other rule sections under this subpart.

        (c) A transmitter control point may be located at a fixed position in a system of communication at or from which the control operator exercises supervision and control over the operation and use of the licensed facilities. Each fixed transmitter control point shall have equipment and facilities to permit the control operator:

        (1) To determine when the transmitter or transmitters controlled are either radiating “RF” energy, or when the transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device which provides a visual indication when the transmitter(s) are radiating or a pilot lamp or meter which provides a visual indication when the transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce radiation. Further, where a local transmitter is used to activate a remote transmitter or transmitters in the licensee's system of communication, a single pilot lamp or meter may be employed to indicate the activation of both the local and the remote transmitter(s).

        (2) To turn the carrier of the transmitter on and off at will, or to close the system down completely, when circumstances warrant such action.

        (d) The licensee's transmitting facilities may be operated from dispatch points, the fixed control point shall have equipment to permit the control operator to either disconnect the dispatch point circuits from the transmitter(s) or to render the transmitter(s) inoperative from any dispatch point being supervised.

        (e) Where the system is interconnected with public communication facilities, as provided at §§ 90.477 through 90.483, and where those rules so require, the fixed control point shall be equipped to permit the control operator:

        (1) To monitor co-channel facilities of other licensees sharing an assigned channel or channels with the licensee in the licensee's area of operation; and,

        (2) To terminate any transmission(s) or communication(s) between points in the public communications system and the private communications system.

        (f) In urban areas, the location of fixed transmitter control points will be specified, “same as transmitter,” unless the control point is at a street address which is different from that of the transmitter(s) controlled. In rural areas, the location of fixed control points will be specified, “same as transmitter,” unless the control point is more than 152.5 m (500 ft) from the transmitter(s) controlled. In the latter case, the approximate location of the control point will be specified in distance and direction from the transmitter(s) controlled in terms of distance and geographical quadrant, respectively. It would be assumed that the location of a fixed control point is the same as the location of the transmitter(s) controlled, unless the applicant includes a request for a different location described in appropriate terms as indicated herein.

        (g) [Reserved]

        (h) Mobile transmitters shall be assumed to be under the immediate control of the mobile operator; provided, however, overall supervision and control of the operation and use of a communication system may be the responsibility of a fixed control point operator. In general, mobile transmitters shall be equipped to permit the operator to determine when they are radiating “RF” energy or when the transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device or of a pilot lamp or meter which will provide a visual indication when the transmitter is radiating or has been placed in a condition to produce radiation provided, however, that hand-carried or pack-carried transmitters and transmitters installed on motorcycles need not be so equipped.

        § 90.465   Control of systems of communication.

#### § § 90.465

        (a) Depending on design considerations, control of a system of communication may be exercised in varying ways. In single frequency simplex, base/mobile operations, control may be exercised by the control operator at the fixed control point. In mobile relay systems, where there is an associated control point or control station, control may be exercised by the operator at the control point or control station. In mobile-only systems, control may be exercised by the mobile operator. In communication systems involving multiple base stations or fixed relays control of the system may result from a combination of factors and considerations, including control by a fixed control point operator at some point within the system of communication or control by the mobile station operator of the licensee.

        (b) In internal systems, as defined in § 90.7, control may be maintained by conforming the system to the requirements of §§ 90.471 through 90.475.

        (c) In interconnected systems, as defined in § 90.7, control may be maintained by conforming operation and system design to that permitted in §§ 90.477 through 90.483.

        § 90.467   Dispatch points.

#### § § 90.467

        Dispatch points meeting the requirements of this section need not be specifically authorized; provided, however, that the licensee of any radio station operated from a dispatch point or points shall assume full responsibility for the use and operation of the authorized facilities in compliance with all applicable provisions of law or rule and shall comply with the policy:

        (a) A dispatch point may be linked to the transmitter(s) being operated by private or leased wire line of fixed radio circuits, provided the requirements of § 90.463 are met.

        (b) No telephone position in the public, switched, telephone network will be treated as a dispatch point within the meaning or intent of this section.

        (c) Operation of transmitting facilities from dispatch points is permitted only when the control operator at a fixed control point in the system is on duty and at no other time.

        § 90.469   Unattended operation.

#### § § 90.469

        (a) Subject to the provisions of §§ 90.243, 90.245, and 90.247, mobile relay, fixed relay, and mobile repeater stations are authorized for unattended operation; and the transmitter control point requirements set out at §§ 90.463 through 90.465 shall not apply.

        (b) Self-activated transmitters may be authorized for unattended operation where they are activated by either electrical or mechanical devices, provided the licensee adopts reasonable means to guard against malfunctions and harmful interference to other users.

      Subpart P—Paging Operations

        § 90.490   One-way paging operations in the private services.

#### § § 90.490

        (a) Subject to specific prohibition or restriction by rule provisions governing the radio service in which a licensee's radio system is authorized, paging operations are permitted:

        (1) Where the signals and messages are transmitted by a control operator of the licensee stationed at a licensed control point in the licensee's system of communication.

        (2) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from an operating position within an internal system of communication which meets the tests of §§ 90.471 through 90.475.

        (3) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from a dispatch point within the licensee's system of communication, as defined as § 90.7.

        (b) Systems employing dial-up circuits (§ 90.461(c)) may be used in one-way paging operations, but only where the paging signals are transmitted as provided at paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (c) Paging may be initiated directly from telephone positions in the public switched telephone network. When land stations are multiple licensed or otherwise shared by authorized users, arrangements for the telephone service must be made with a duly authorized carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit, cost-shared basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangements must maintain cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and made available to participants in the sharing arrangement and the Commission upon request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the use.

        § 90.525   Administration of interoperability channels.

#### § § 90.525

        (a) States are responsible for administration of the Interoperability channels in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands. Base and control stations must be licensed individually. A public safety entity meeting the requirements of § 90.523 may operate mobile or portable units on the Interoperability channels in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands without a specific authorization from the Commission provided it holds a part 90 license. All persons operating mobile or portable units under this authority are responsible for compliance with part 90 of these rules and other applicable federal laws.

        (b) License applications for Interoperability channels in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands must be approved by a state-level agency or organization responsible for administering state emergency communications. States may hold the licenses for Interoperability channels or approve other qualified entities to hold such licenses. States may delegate the approval process for interoperability channels to another entity, such as regional planning committees.

        § 90.527   Regional plan requirements.

#### § § 90.527

        Each regional planning committee must submit a regional plan for approval by the Commission.

        (a)  Regional plans must incorporate the following common elements:

        (1) Identification of the document as the regional plan for the defined region with the names, business addresses, business telephone numbers, and organizational affiliations of the chairpersons and all members of the planning committee.

        (2) A summary of the major elements of the plan and an explanation of how all eligible entities within the region were given an opportunity to participate in the planning process and to have their positions heard and considered fairly.

        (3) A general description of how the spectrum would be allotted among the various eligible users within the region with an explanation of how the requirements of all eligible entities within the region were considered and, to the degree possible, met.

        (4) An explanation as to how needs were assigned priorities in areas where not all eligible entities could receive licenses.

        (5) An explanation of how the plan had been coordinated with adjacent regions.

        (6) A detailed description of how the plan put the spectrum to the best possible use by requiring system design with minimum coverage areas, by assigning frequencies so that maximum frequency reuse and offset channel use may be made, by using trunking, and by requiring small entities with minimal requirements to join together in using a single system where possible.

        (7) A detailed description of the future planning process, including, but not limited to, amendment process, meeting announcements, data base maintenance, and dispute resolution.

        (8) A certification by the regional planning chairperson that all planning committee meetings, including subcommittee or executive committee meetings, were open to the public.

        (b)  Regional plans may be modified by submitting a written request, signed by the regional planning committee, to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. The request must contain the full text of the modification. Modifications are considered either major or minor. Regional planning committees must certify that successful coordination with all adjacent regions has occurred for major modifications and that all such regions concur with the major modification. Unless requested otherwise by the regional planning committee, the Bureau will only place major modifications on public notice for comment.

        (1) Except as noted below, modifications changing the way channels are allocated, allotted or coordinated are considered major modifications.

        (2) Modifications changing how channels are allotted are considered minor modifications only if:

        (i) The proposed channel change or channel addition involves a facility located more than seventy miles from the adjacent region border;

        (ii) The co-channel or adjacent channel interference contour of the facility changing or adding the channel does not intersect the border of an adjacent region, or

        (iii) The proposed channel change or channel addition has been coordinated in writing with any affected adjacent region.

        (3) Changes in membership or leadership of regional planning committees are considered minor modifications.

        § 90.529   State License.

#### § § 90.529

        (a) Narrowband channels designated as state channels in § 90.531 are licensed to each state (as defined in § 90.7) as follows:

        (1) Each state that chooses to take advantage of the spectrum designated as state channels must file an application for up to 2.4 megahertz of this spectrum no later than December 31, 2001. For purposes of this section, the elected chief executive (Governor) of each state, or his or her designee, shall be deemed the person authorized to apply for the State License.

        (2) What ever part of this 2.4 megahertz that a state has not applied for by December 31, 2001, will revert to General Use and be administered by the relevant RPC (or RPCs in the instances of states that encompass multiple RPCs).

        (b) Each state license will be granted subject to the condition that the state certifies on or before each applicable benchmark date that it is:

        (1) Providing or prepared to provide “substantial service” to one-third of their population or territory by June 13, 2014, i.e., within five years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to relocate to other portions of the spectrum;

        (2) Providing or prepared to provide “substantial service” to two-thirds of their population or territory by June 13, 2019, i.e., within ten years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to relocate to other portions of the spectrum.

        (c) The Commission will deem a state “prepared to provide substantial service” if the licensee certifies that a radio system has been approved and funded for implementation by the deadline date. “Substantial service” refers to the construction and operation of 700 MHz facilities by public safety entities providing service which is sound, favorable , and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal.

        (d) If a state licensee fails to meet any condition of the grant the state license is modified automatically to the frequencies and geographic areas where the state certifies that it is providing substantial service.

        (e) Any recovered state license spectrum will revert to General Use. However, spectrum licensed to a state under a state license remains unavailable for reassignment to other applicants until the Commission's database reflects the parameters of the modified state license.

        § 90.543   Emission limitations.

#### § § 90.543

        Transmitters designed to operate in 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands must meet the emission limitations in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Class A and Class B signal boosters retransmitting signals in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands are exempt from the limits listed in paragraph (a) of this section when simultaneously retransmitting multiple signals and instead shall be subject to the limit listed in paragraph (c) of this section when operating in this manner. Transmitters operating in 758-768 MHz and 788-798 MHz bands must meet the emission limitations in (e) of this section.

        (a) The adjacent channel power (ACP) requirements for transmitters designed for various channel sizes are shown in the following tables. Mobile station requirements apply to handheld, car mounted and control station units. The tables specify a value for the ACP as a function of the displacement from the channel center frequency and measurement bandwidth. In the following tables, “(s)” indicates a swept measurement may be used.

        (b)  The following are the procedures for making the transmitter ACP measurements. For all measurements modulate the transmitter as it would be modulated in normal operating conditions. For time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is active. All measurements are made at the transmitter's output port. If a transmitter has an integral antenna, a suitable power coupling device shall be used to couple the RF signal to the measurement instrument. The coupling device shall substantially maintain the proper transmitter load impedance. The ACP measurements may be made with a spectrum analyzer capable of making direct ACP measurements. “Measurement bandwidth”, as used for non-swept measurements, implies an instrument that measures the power in many narrow bandwidths equal to the nominal resolution bandwidth and integrates these powers to determine the total power in the specified measurement bandwidth.

        (1)  Set transmitter to maximum output power. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter set the measurement bandwidth to 6.25 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero and adjust the center frequency of the instrument to the assigned center frequency to measure the average power level of the transmitter. Record this power level in dBm as the “reference power level.”

        (2)  Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the mesurement bandwidth and frequency offset from the assigned center frequency as shown in the tables in § 90.543 (a) above. Any value of resolution bandwidth may be used as long as it does not exceed 2 percent of the specified measurement bandwidth. Measure the power level in dBm. These measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate ACP by substracting the reference power level measured in (b)(1) from the measurements made in this step. The absolute value of the calculated ACP must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the ACP given in the table for each condition above.

        (3)  Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and average, sample, or RMS detection. Set the reference level of the spectrum analyzer to the RMS value of the transmitter power. Sweep above and below the carrier frequency to the limits defined in the tables. Calculate ACP by substracting the reference power level measured in (b)(1) from the measurements made in this step. The absolute value of the calculated ACP must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the ACP given in the table for each condition above.

        (c)  On any frequency outside of the frequency ranges covered by the ACP tables in this section, the power of any emission must be reduced below the mean output power (P) by at least 43 + 10log (P) dB measured in a 100 kHz bandwidth for frequencies less than 1 GHz, and in a 1 MHz bandwidth for frequencies greater than 1 GHz.

        (d)  Provided that the ACP requirements of this section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth that does not exceed the channel size.

        (e) For operations in the 758-768 MHz and the 788-798 MHz bands, the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the following:

        (1) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a factor not less than 76 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for base and fixed stations.

        (2) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a factor not less than 65 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for mobile and portable stations.

        (3) On any frequency between 775-788 MHz, above 805 MHz, and below 758 MHz, by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.

        (4) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation such that the reading taken with any resolution bandwidth setting should be adjusted to indicate spectral energy in a 6.25 kHz segment.

        (5) Compliance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. However, in the 100 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block, a resolution bandwidth of 30 kHz may be employed.

        (f) For operations in the 758-775 MHz and 788-805 MHz bands, all emissions including harmonics in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited to −70 dBW/MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and −80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that is representative of the type that will be used with the equipment in normal operation.

        (g) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.

        (1) Location;

        (2) Effective radiated power;

        (3) Antenna height; and

        (4) Channels available for use.

        (b)  The prior coordination of base or fixed stations is for informational purposes only. Public safety licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed base or fixed station or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:

        (1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee whether it believes a proposed base or fixed station will generate unacceptable interference;

        (2) Permit 746-757 and 776-787 MHz band licensees to make voluntary changes in base or fixed station parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and,

        (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the base or fixed station is activated.

        (c)  (1) Upon request by a 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee, public safety licensees authorized to operate radio systems in the 758-775 and 788-805 MHz bands shall provide the operating parameters of their radio system to the 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensee.

        (2) Public safety licensees who perform the information exchange described in this section must notify the appropriate 746-757 or 776-787 MHz band licensees prior to any technical changes to their radio system.

        § 90.559   Station Identification.

#### § § 90.559

        (a) Conventional systems of communication shall be identified in accordance with existing regulations governing such matters.

        (b) Trunked systems of communication, except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be identified through the use of an automatic device which transmits the call sign of the base station facility at 30 minute intervals. Such station identification shall be made on the lowest frequency in the base station trunk group assigned the licensee. Should this frequency be in use at the time station identification is required, such identification may be made at the termination of the communication in progress on this frequency. Identification may be made by voice or International Morse Code. When the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, the tone frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.

        (c) Stations operating in the 769-775/799-805 MHz band that are licensed on an exclusive basis, and normally employ digital signals for the transmission of data, text, control codes, or digitized voice may also be identified by digital transmission of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner must provide the Commission, upon its request, information sufficient to decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.

          (i) Channels will be chosen and assigned in accordance with §§ 90.615, 90.617, or 90.619.

          (ii) A mobile station is authorized to transmit on any frequency assigned to its associated base station.

          (b) Stations authorized on frequencies listed in this subpart, except for those stations authorized pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section and EA-based and MTA-based SMR systems, will be assigned co-channel frequencies solely on the basis of distance between fixed stations. In addition, contour overlap as detailed in paragraph (d) of this section will be the basis for geographic separation between fixed stations operating on adjacent-channel frequencies in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz sub-band, except where such fixed stations meet the distance separation criteria set out in this paragraph (b).

          (1) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, no station in Channel Blocks A through V shall be less than 169 km (105 mi) distant from a co-channel station that has been granted channel exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the following mountaintop sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, Mount Wilson (California). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, no incumbent licensee in Channel Blocks F1 through V that has received the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dBµV/m signal strength interference contour shall be less than 229 km (142 mi) distant from a co-channel station that has been granted channel exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the following mountaintop sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, Mount Wilson (California).

          (2) The separation between co-channel stations that have been granted exclusivity and that are located at high sites in California north of 35° N Latitude and west of 118° W Longitude shall be determined as follows:

          (i) Required co-channel separations between common antenna sites are given by table 1. A channel group assigned to a station on a site listed in the vertical column may not be re-assigned to a station on a site listed in the horizontal column if there is an “X” in the box created by the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. The geographic coordinates listed in the table represent an average for each particular site; all locations within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the coordinates will be considered to be at that site.

          (ii) Required co-channel separations involving antenna sites not listed in table 1 shall be determined by Commission staff on a case by case basis. The interference potential of proposed assignments will be evaluated considering parameters such as antenna height, effective radiated power, terrain irregularities, and market conditions.

          (3) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, stations in Channel Blocks A through V that have been granted channel exclusivity and are located in the State of Washington at the locations listed in the table below shall be separated from co-channel stations by a minimum of 169 km (105 mi). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, incumbent licensees in Channel Blocks F1 through V that have received the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dBµV/m signal strength interference contour, have been granted channel exclusivity and are located in the State of Washington at the locations listed in the table below shall be separated from co-channel stations by a minimum of 229 km (142 mi). Locations within one mile of the geographical coordinates listed in the table below will be considered to be at that site.

          (4) Upon an applicant's specific request to the Commission or a frequency coordinator, co-channel stations may be separated by less than 113 km (70 mi) by meeting certain transmitter ERP and antenna height criteria. The following table indicates separations assignable to such co-channel stations for various transmitter power and antenna height combinations. The minimum separation permitted is 88 km (55 mi). Applicants will provide the Commission with a statement that the application is submitted for consideration under the table, a list of all co-channel stations within 113 km (70 mi), and the DHAATs and ERPs for these stations and the applicant's proposed station. Applicants seeking to be licensed for stations located at distances less than those prescribed in the table are required to secure a waiver and must submit with the application, in addition to the above, an interference analysis, based upon any of the generally-accepted terrain-based propagation models, that shows that co-channel stations would receive the same or greater interference protection than provided in the table. Requests for separations less than 88 km (55 mi) must also include an analysis of interference potential from mobile transmitters to existing co-channel base station receivers. Applicants seeking a waiver must submit with their application a certificate of service indicating that concurrent with the submission of the application to the Commission or a coordinator, all co-channel licensees within the applicable area were served with a copy of the application and all attachments thereto. Licensees thus served may file an opposition to the application within 30 days from the date the application is filed with the Commission.

          (i) The directional height of the antenna above average terrain (DHAAT) is calculated from the average of the antenna heights above average terrain from 3 to 16 km (2 to 10 mi) from the proposed site along a radial extending in the direction of the existing station and the radials 15 degrees to either side of that radial.

          (ii) Except for the sites listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section, additional co-channel distance separation must be afforded to an existing station from an applicant wishing to locate a station less than 113 km (70 mi) from a co-channel station, where either the applicant's or the existing station is located at sites with DHAATs of 458 m (1500 ft) and above. The separation between short-spaced co-channel stations shall be determined as follows:

          (A) Calculate the DHAAT in each direction between every existing co-channel station with 113 km (70 mi) and the proposed station.

          (B) In the table, locate the approximate ERP and DHAAT values for the proposed and existing stations.

          (C) When DHAAT values are greater than 458 m (1500 ft), use the required separation for 305 m (1000 ft) and add 1.6 km (1 mi) for every 30.5 km (100 ft), or increment thereof, of DHAAT above 458 m (1500 ft) to the distance indicated in the table. If both the proposed existing stations have DHAATs of 458 m (1500 ft) or more, the additional distance is separately determined for each station and the combined distance is added to the distance obtained from the table. Protection to existing stations will be afforded only up to 113 km (70 mi).

          (5) The separation between co-channel systems may be less than the separations defined above if an applicant submits with its application letters of concurrence indicating that the applicant and each co-channel licensee within the specified separation agree to accept any interference resulting from the reduced separation between their systems. Each letter from a co-channel licensee must certify that the system of the concurring licensee is constructed and fully operational. The applicant must also submit with its application a certificate of service indicating that all concurring co-channel licensees have been served with an actual copy of the application.

          (6) A station located closer than the distances provided in this section to a co-channel station that was authorized as short-spaced under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall be permitted to modify its facilities as long as the station does not extend its 22 dBu contour beyond its maximum 22 dBu contour (i.e., the 22 dBu contour calculated using the station's maximum power and antenna height at its original location) in the direction of the short-spaced station.

          (7) Offset frequencies in the 811-821/856-866 MHz band for use only within U.S./Mexico border area, as designated in § 90.619(a), shall be considered co-channel with non-offset frequencies in this band as designated in § 90.613. New applications for frequencies in this band for stations adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border area must comply with the co-channel separation provisions of this section.

          (c) Conventional systems authorized on frequencies in the Public Safety (except for those systems that have participated in a formal regional planning process as described in § 90.16) and Business/Industrial/Land Transportation categories which have not met the loading levels necessary for channel exclusivity will not be afforded co-channel protection.

          (d) Geographic separation between fixed stations operating on adjacent channels in the 809-817/854-862 MHz Mid-Band segment must be based on lack of contour overlap as detailed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4), unless the co-channel distance separation criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are met.

          (1)  An applicant seeking to license a fixed station on a channel in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz band segment will only be granted if the applicant's proposed interference contour creates no overlap with the 40 dBu F(50,50) contour of an incumbent operating a fixed station on an upper- or lower-adjacent channel. The applicant's interference contour is determined using the dBu level listed in the appropriate table in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For this analysis the applicant shall plot the interference contour of its proposed fixed station at its proposed ERP but assume that any adjacent-channel incumbent licensee is operating at the maximum permitted ERP for the licensed antenna height.

          (2)  In addition to the contour analysis described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any applicant seeking to license a fixed station on a channel in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz band segment must also pass a reciprocal contour analysis. Under the reciprocal analysis, the interference contour, F(50,10) of an incumbent operating a fixed station on an upper- or lower-adjacent channel must create no contour overlap with the proposed 40 dBu F(50,50) contour of the applicant's fixed station. The incumbent's interference contour is determined using the dBu level listed in the appropriate table in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For this analysis the applicant shall plot the coverage contour of its fixed station, F(50,50), at its proposed ERP and antenna height above average terrain but plot the interference contour, F(50,10), of any adjacent-channel incumbent licensee at its maximum permitted ERP for the licensed antenna height.

          (3)  Interference contour levels for the contour analysis described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section are determined using Table 4 or Table 5 to this paragraph (d)(3). Table 4 is used to determine the interference contour F(50,10) level of a fixed station operating on a 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth channel while Table 5 is used to determine the interference contour F(50,10) level of a fixed station operating on a 25 kilohertz bandwidth channel. The dBu level of the interference contour is determined by cross-referencing the modulation type of the station operating on the 25 kilohertz bandwidth channel with the modulation type of the station operating on the 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth channel.

          (4)  Applicants may submit applications which cause overlap under the forward contour analysis described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section provided the applicant includes a letter of concurrence from each incumbent that receives contour overlap. In the letter of concurrence, the incumbent operator must agree to accept any interference that occurs as a result of the contour overlap. Applicants may also submit applications which receive contour overlap under the reciprocal analysis described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section provided the applicant includes a letter of concurrence from each incumbent that causes contour overlap. In this case, the incumbent operator must state in its letter of concurrence that it does not object to the applicant receiving contour overlap from the incumbent's facility.

          (e) Frequencies in the 809-817/854-862 MHz bands listed as available for eligibles in the Public Safety and Business/Industrial/Land Transportation Categories are available for inter-category sharing under the following conditions:

          (1) Channels in the Public Safety and Business/Industrial/Land Transportation categories will be available to eligible applicants in those categories only if there are no frequencies in their own category and no public safety systems are authorized on those channels under consideration to be shared.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(5) of this section, licensees of channels in the Business/Industrial/Land Transportation category may request a modification of the license, see § 1.947 of this chapter, to authorize use of the channels for commercial operation. The licensee may also, at the same time or thereafter, seek authorization to transfer or assign the license, see § 1.948 of this chapter, to any person eligible for licensing in the General or SMR categories. Applications submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be filed in accordance with the rules governing other applications for commercial channels, and will be processed in accordance with those rules. Grant of requests submitted pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the following conditions:

          (i) A licensee that modifies its license to authorize commercial operations will not be authorized to obtain additional 800 MHz Business/Industrial/Land Transportation category channels for sites located within 113 km (70 mi.) of the station for which the license was modified, for a period of one year from the date the license is modified. This provision applies to the licensee, its controlling interests and their affiliates, as defined in § 1.2110 of this chapter.

          (ii) With respect to licenses the initial application for which was filed on or after November 9, 2000, requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section may not be filed until five years after the date of the initial license grant. In the case of a license that is modified on or after November 9, 2000 to add 800 MHz Business/Industrial/Land Transportation frequencies or to add or relocate base stations that expand the licensee's interference contour, requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section for these frequencies or base stations may not be filed until five years after such modification.

          (iii) Requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section must include a certification that written notice of the modification application has been provided to all Public Safety licensees, see § 90.20(a), with base stations within 113 km (70 mi.) of the site of the channel(s) for which authorization for commercial use is sought that operate within 25 kHz of the center of those channel(s). If, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, modification and assignment or transfer applications are filed at different times, the written notice required by this paragraph must be provided each time.

          (iv) The applicant must certify that it will take reasonable precautions to avoid causing harmful interference to Public Safety licen_see_s,  § 90.20(a), and to take such action as may be necessary to eliminate interference to such licensees caused by its operations. (When an assignment or transfer application is filed pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this representation is required only of the assignee or transferee.) Licensees of stations suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of operation.

          (3) Licensees granted authorizations pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section may at any time request modification of the license to authorize use of the channels consistent with the rules governing the category to which they are allocated, provided that the licensee meets the applicable eligibility requirements.

          (4) [Reserved]

          (5) The frequency coordinator must certify that frequencies are not available in the applicant's own category, and coordination is required from the applicable out-of-category coordinator.

          (6) The out-of-category licensee must operate by the rules applicable to the category to which the frequency is allocated.

          (f) Licen__see__s of channels in the Business/Industrial/Land Transportation Categories in the 896-901/935-940 MHz bands may request a modification of the license,  § 1.947 of this chapter, to authorize use of the channels for commercial operation. The licensee may also, at the same time, or thereafter, seek authorization to transfer or assign the license,  § 1.948 of this chapter, to any person eligible for licensing in the General or SMR categories. Applications submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be filed in accordance with the rules governing other applications for commercial channels, and will be processed in accordance with those rules.

          (g) Applications for Public Safety systems (both trunked and conventional) in the 806-809/851-854 MHz bands will be assigned and protected based on the criteria established in the appropriate regional plan. See § 90.16 and the Report and Order in General Docket 87-112.

          § 90.629   Extended implementation period.

#### § § 90.629

          Applicants requesting frequencies for either trunked or conventional operations may be authorized a period of up to five (5) years for constructing and placing a system in operation in accordance with the following:

          (a) The applicant must justify an extended implementation period. The justification must describe the proposed system, state the amount of time necessary to construct and place the system in operation, identify the number of base stations to be constructed and placed in operation during each year of the extended construction period, and show that:

          (1) The proposed system will require longer than twelve (12) months to construct and place in operation because of its purpose, size, or complexity; or

          (2) The proposed system is to be part of a coordinated or integrated wide-area system which will require more than twelve (12) months to plan, approve, fund, purchase, construct, and place in operation; or

          (3) The applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year cycle for planning, approval, funding, and purchasing the proposed system.

          (b) Where an applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year cycle for planning, approval, funding and purchasing a proposed system, the applicant must indicate whether funding approval has been obtained and if not, when such funding approval is expected.

          (c) Authorizations under this section are conditioned upon the licensee constructing and placing its system in operation within the authorized implementation period and in accordance with an approved implementation plan of up to five years. Licensees must notify the Commission annually, using FCC Form 601, that they are in compliance with their yearly station construction commitments, but may request amendment to these commitments at the time they file their annual certification. If the Commission approves the requested amendments to a licensee's implementation commitments, the licensee's extended implementation authority will remain in effect. If, however, the Commission concludes, at this or any other time, that a licensee has failed to meet its commitments, the Commission will terminate authority for the extended implementation period. When the Commission terminates an extended implementation authority, the affected licensee will be given six months from the date of termination to complete system construction. At the end of any licensee's extended implementation period, authorizations for all stations not constructed and placed in operation will be cancelled. Trunked systems granted an extended implementation period must comply with the channel loading requirements of section 90.631(b). Conventional channels not loaded to 70 mobile units may be subject to shared use by the addition of other licensees.

          (d) [Reserved]

          (e) As of March 18, 1996, Specialized Mobile Radio systems are not eligible for extended implementation periods under this section. Additionally, all 800 MHz SMR licensees that are operating under extended implementation authority as of March 18, 1996 must, by May 16, 1996, demonstrate that continuing to allow them to have an extended period of time to construct their facilities is warranted and furthers the public interest. If a licensee's extended implementation authority showing is approved by the Bureau, such licensee will be afforded an extended implementation of two years or the remainder of its current extended implementation period, whichever is shorter. Upon the termination of this period, the authorizations for those facilities that remain unconstructed will terminate automatically. If a licensee with a current extended implementation period fails to submit the showing mentioned above within the designated timeframe or submits an insufficient or incomplete showing, such licensee will have six months from the last day on which it could timely file such a showing or from the disapproval of its request to construct the remaining facilities covered under its implementation plan to construct any unconstructed facilities for which it is authorized. The authorizations for those facilities remaining unconstructed after this six-month period will terminate automatically.

          (f) Pursuant to § 90.155(b), the provisions of this section shall apply to local government entities applying for any frequency in the Public Safety Pool.

          § 90.631   Trunked systems loading, construction and authorization requirements.

#### § § 90.631

          (a) Non-SMR trunked systems will be authorized on the basis of a loading criteria of one hundred (100) mobile stations per channel. For purposes of determining compliance with trunked system loading requirements under this subpart, the term “mobile station” includes vehicular and portable mobile units and control stations.

          (b) Each applicant for a non-SMR trunked system must certify that a minimum of seventy (70) mobiles for each channel authorized will be placed into operation within five (5) years of the initial license grant.

          (c) Except for SMR applicants and as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an applicant seeking to expand a trunked system by requesting additional channels from the Commission, or through intercategory sharing, or through an assignment, must have a loading level of seventy (70) mobiles per channel on the existing system that is the subject of the expansion request.

          (d) In rural areas, a licensee of a trunked system may request to increase its system capacity by five more channels than it has constructed without meeting the loading requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A rural area is defined for purposes of this section as being beyond a 100-mile radius of the following designated centers of the following urban areas: New York, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; Philadelphia, PA; San Francisco, CA; Detroit, MI; Boston, MA; Houston, TX; Washington, DC; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Miami, FL; Cleveland, OH; St. Louis, MO; Atlanta, GA; Pittsburgh, PA; Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Seattle, WA; San Diego, CA; and Tampa-St.Petersburg, FL. The coordinates for the centers of these areas are those referenced in § 90.741, except that the coordinates (referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)) for Tampa-St. Petersburg are latitude 28°00′1.1″ N, longitude 82°26′59.3″ W.

          (e) Except as provided in § 90.629, licensees of trunked facilities must complete construction within one year.

          (f) If a station is not placed in permanent operation, in accordance with the technical parameters of the station authorization, within one year, except as provided in § 90.629, its license cancels automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not considered to be placed in operation unless at least two associated mobile stations, or one control station and one mobile station, are also placed in operation.

          (g) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing of need. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems in the Public Safety, Special Emergency, Telephone Maintenance, and Power Radio Services may be authorized on a primary basis if such stations are the first to be authorized in their area of operation on the frequency or group of frequencies. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems in all other services will be authorized only on a secondary, non-interference basis to cochannel licensees. To determine system loading, the total number of mobile units and control stations operating in the wide-area system shall be counted with respect to the total number of base station frequencies assigned to the system.

          (h) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with which it communicates regularly.

> [47 FR 41032, Sept. 16, 1982]

          § 90.633   Conventional systems loading requirements.

#### § § 90.633

          (a) Non-SMR conventional systems of communication will be authorized on the basis of a minimum loading criteria of seventy (70) mobile stations for each channel authorized.

          (b) A channel will not be assigned to additional licensees when it is loaded to 70 mobile stations. Where a licensee does not load a channel to 70 mobiles the channel will be available for assignment to other licensees. All authorizations for conventional systems are issued subject to this potential channel sharing condition.

          (c) Except as provided in § 90.629 of this part, licensees of conventional systems must place their authorized stations in operation not later than one year after the date of grant of the system license.

          (d) If a station is not placed in operation within one year, except as provided in Section 90.629 of this part, the license cancels automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not considered to be in operation unless at least one associated mobile station is also in operation.

          (e) A non-SMR licensee may apply for additional frequency pairs if its authorized conventional channel(s) is loaded to seventy (70) mobiles. Applications may be considered for additional channels in areas where spectrum is still available and not applied for, even if the already authorized channel(s) is not loaded to 70 mobile units, upon an appropriate demonstration of need.

          (f) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing of need. For loading purposes, if the total number of mobile stations justifies the total number of authorized based frequencies in a given area, the system will be construed to be loaded.

          (g) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with which it communicates regularly.

          § 90.637   Restrictions on operational fixed stations.

#### § § 90.637

          (a) Except for control stations, operational fixed operations will not be authorized in the 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, or 935-940 MHz bands. This does not preclude secondary fixed tone signaling and alarm operations authorized in § 90.235 or in paragraph (c) of this section.

          (b) Control stations associated with one or more mobile relay stations will be authorized only on the assigned frequency of the associated mobile station. Use of a mobile service frequency by a control station of a mobile relay system is subject to the condition that harmful interference shall not be caused to stations of licensees authorized to use the frequency for mobile service communications.

          (c) Trunked and conventional systems that have exclusive-use status in their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary signaling and data transmissions subject to the following requirements:

          (1) All operations must be on a secondary, non-interference basis to the primary mobile operation of any other licensee.

          (2) The output power at the remote site must not exceed 30 watts.

          (3) Any fixed transmitters will not count toward meeting the mobile loading requirements nor be considered in whole or in part as a justification for authorizing additional frequencies in the licensee's mobile system.

          (4) Automatic means must be provided to deactivate the remote transmitter in the event the carrier remains on for a period in excess of three minutes.

          (5) Operational fixed stations authorized pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of §§ 90.425 and 90.429.

          (d) Conventional systems that do not have exclusive-use status in their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary signaling and data transmissions only in accordance with all the provisions of § 90.235.

#### § § 90.645

          Conventional and trunked radio systems may be used:

          (a) Only for purposes expressly allowed under this part.

          (b) Only persons who are eligible for facilities, either under this subpart or in the radio service included under subparts B or C of this part.

          (c) Except for licensees classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter, only for the transmission of messages or signals permitted in the services is which the participants are eligible.

          (d) For digital or analog transmissions.

          (e) An SMRS licensee or a licensee who has been authorized a channel(s) on an exclusive basis, may use the system for the transmission of any base/mobile message, page or signal permitted in the service in which the participants are eligible.

          (f) Where the channel(s) is assigned to an SMRS licensee or exclusively to a single licensee, or where all users of a system agree, more than a single emission may be utilized within the authorized bandwidth. In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of § 90.213 shall not apply, but out-of-band emission limits of § 90.209 shall be met.

          (g) Up to five (5) contiguous 809-816/854-861 band channels as listed in §§ 90.615, 90.617, and 90.619 may be authorized after justification for systems requiring more than the normal single channel bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade channels amongst themselves in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. Notification of such proposed exchanges shall be made to the appropriate frequency coordinator(s) and to the Commission by filing an application for license modification.

          (h) Up to 10 contiguous 896-901/935-940 MHz band channels as listed in § 90.617 may be combined for systems requiring more than the normal single channel bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade channels amongst themselves in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. Notification of such proposed exchanges shall be made to the appropriate frequency coordinator(s) and to the Commission by filing an application for license modification.

          (i) Paging operations may be utilized on multiple licensed facilities (community repeaters) only when all licensees of the facility agree to such use.

          § 90.647   Station identification.

#### § § 90.647

          (a) Conventional systems of communication shall be identified in accordance with existing regulations governing such matters.

          (b) Trunked systems of communication, except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be identified through the use of an automatic device which transmits the call sign of the base station facility at 30 minute intervals. Such station identification shall be made on the lowest frequency in the base station trunk group assigned the licensee. Should this frequency be in use at the time station identification is required, such identification may be made at the termination of the communication in progress on this frequency. Identification may be made by voice or International Morse Code. When the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, the tone frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.

          (c) Stations operating in either the 806-824/851-869 MHz or 896-901/935-940 MHz bands that are licensed on an exclusive basis, and normally employ digital signals for the transmission of data, text, control codes, or digitized voice may also be identified by digital transmission of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner must provide the Commission, upon its request, information sufficient to decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.

          (d) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this paragraph, systems operated by geographic area CMRS licensees are subject only to the station identification requirements of § 90.425(e).

          § 90.663   MTA-based SMR system operations.

#### § § 90.663

          (a) MTA-based licensees authorized in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band pursuant to § 90.661 may construct and operate base stations using any frequency identified in their spectrum block anywhere within their authorized MTA, provided that:

          (1) The MTA licensee affords protection, in accordance with § 90.621(b), to all sites for which applications were filed on or prior to August 9, 1994.

          (2) The MTA licensee complies with any rules and international agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified in their spectrum block, including the provisions of § 90.619 relating to U.S./Canadian and U.S./Mexican border areas.

          (3) The MTA licensee limits its field strength at any location on the border of the MTA service area in accordance with § 90.671 and masks its emissions in accordance with § 90.669.

          (b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized co-channel station within the MTA licensee's authorized spectrum block is terminated or revoked, the MTA licensee's co-channel obligations to such station will cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's licensing record. The MTA licensee then will be able to construct and operate base stations using such frequency.

          § 90.665   Authorization, construction and implementation of MTA licenses.

#### § § 90.665

          (a) MTA licenses in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be issued for a term not to exceed ten years.

          (b) MTA licensees in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be permitted five years to construct their stations. This five-year period will commence with the issuance of the MTA-wide authorization and will apply to all of the licensee's stations within the MTA spectrum block, including any stations that may have been subject to an earlier construction deadline arising from a pre-existing authorization.

          (c) Each MTA licensee in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band must, three years from the date of license grant, construct and place into operation a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at least one-third of the population of the MTA; further, each MTA licensee must provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the population of the MTA five years from the date of license grant. Alternatively, an MTA licensee must demonstrate, through a showing to the Commission five years from the date of license grant, that it is providing substantial service. An MTA licensee must, three years from license grant, either show that the   population coverage standard has been satisfied, or provide written notification that it has elected to show substantial service to the MTA five years from license grant. In addition, as part of the election to provide a substantial service showing, each MTA licensee must, three years from license grant, indicate how it expects to demonstrate substantial service at five years. The MTA licensee must meet the population coverage benchmarks regardless of the extent to which incumbent licensees are present within the MTA block.

          (d) MTA licensees who fail to meet the coverage requirements imposed at either the third or fifth years of their license term, or to make a convincing showing of substantial service, will forfeit the portion of the MTA license that exceeds licensed facilities constructed and operating on the date of the MTA license grant.

          § 90.667   Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

#### § § 90.667

          (a) These provisions apply to all 900 MHz SMR licensees who obtained licenses or filed applications for secondary sites on or before August 9, 1994 (“incumbent licensees”), as well as to all 900 MHz SMR licensees who obtained authorizations pursuant to § 90.173(k). An incumbent licensee's service area shall be defined by its originally-licensed 40 dBu field strength contour. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add new or modify transmit sites in this existing service area without prior notification to the Commission so long as their original 40 dBu field strength contour is not expanded.

          (b) Incumbent licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant of MTA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and overlapping 40 dBu field strength contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific information for each of their external base sites after the close of the 900 MHz SMR auction.

          (c) Applications in the 900 MHz SMR service for secondary sites filed after August 9, 1994 shall be authorized on a secondary, non-interference basis to MTA licensee operations. No secondary sites shall be granted on this basis in an MTA once the MTA licensee has been selected.

MTA licensees are also required to coordinate their frequency usage with so-channel adjacent MTA licensees and all other affected parties. To the extent that a single entity obtains licenses for adjacent MTAs on the same channel block, it will not be required to coordinate its operations in this manner. In the event that this standard conflicts with the MTA licensee's obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbent licensees under § 90.621(b), the requirements of § 90.621(b) shall prevail.

        Procedures and Process—Unacceptable Interference

          § 90.672   Unacceptable interference to non-cellular 800 MHz licensees from 800 MHz cellular systems or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone systems, and within the 900 MHz narrowband segments, and to narrowband 900 MHz licensees from 900 MHz broadband licensees.

#### § § 90.672

          (a)  Except as provided in 47 CFR 90.617(k), unacceptable interference to non-cellular licensees in the 800 MHz band from 800 MHz cellular systems or part 22 of this chapter, Cellular Radiotelephone systems; unacceptable interference within the 900 MHz narrowband segment; and unacceptable interference to narrowband 900 MHz licensees from 900 MHz broadband licensees, will be deemed to occur when the below conditions are met:

          (1) A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:

          (i) Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:

          (A) From the 800 MHz band, a median desired signal strength of −104 dBm or higher if operating in the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of −88 dBm if operating in the 900 MHz narrowband segment, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a mobile unit; or

          (B) From the 800 MHz band, a median desired signal strength of −101 dBm or higher if operating in the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of −85 dBm if operating in the 900 MHz narrowband segment; or, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a portable  hand-held unit;

          (C) From the 900 MHz broadband segment, a median desired signal strength of −104 dBm or higher if operating in the 900 MHz narrowband segment, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a mobile unit; or

          (D) From the 900 MHz broadband segment, median desired signal strength of −101 dBm or higher if operating in the 900 MHz narrowband segment, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a portable,  hand-held unit; and either

          (ii) Is a voice transceiver:

          (A) With manufacturer published performance specifications for the receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, and;

          (B) Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the measured Carrier to Noise plus Interference (C/(I + N)) ratio of the receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB if operating in the 800 MHz band, or less than 17 dB if operating in the 900 MHz narrowband segment, or;

          (iii) Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.

          (2) Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward adjustment shall be equal to the increase in the desired signal required to restore the receiver section of the subject transceiver to the 20 dB C/(I + N) ratio of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted threshold levels shall then define the minimum measured signal power(s) in lieu of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee using such non-compliant transceiver is entitled to interference protection.

          (b)  Voice transceivers capable of operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band, or in the 900 MHz narrowband segment, shall have the following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection against unacceptable interference. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)

          (1) Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; −116 dBm reference sensitivity.

          (2) Voice units intended for portable use: 70 dB intermodulation rejection ratio; 70 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; −116 dBm reference sensitivity.

          (3) Voice units intended for mobile or portable use in the 900 MHz narrowband segment: 60 dB intermodulation rejection ratio; 60 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; −116 dBm reference sensitivity.

#### § § 90.673

          (a)  Any licensee who, knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, causes or contributes to causing unacceptable interference to a non-cellular licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in this chapter, shall be strictly accountable to abate the interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in the shortest time practicable. Interfering licensees shall consider all feasible interference abatement measures, including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the interference resolution procedures set forth in this chapter. This strict responsibility obligation applies to all forms of interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.

          (b)  If two or more licensees knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, cause or contribute to causing unacceptable interference to a non-cellular licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in this chapter, such licensees shall be jointly and severally responsible for abating interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in the shortest practicable time. This joint and several responsibility rule requires interfering licensees to consider all feasible interference abatement measures, including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the interference resolution procedures set forth in this chapter. This joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms of interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.

          (1) This joint and several responsibility rule requires interfering licensees to consider all feasible interference abatement measures, including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the interference resolution procedures set forth in § 90.674(c). This joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms of interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.

          (2) Any licensee that can show that its signal does not directly or indirectly, cause or contribute to causing unacceptable interference to a non-cellular licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in this chapter, shall not be held responsible for resolving unacceptable interference. Notwithstanding, any licensee that receives an interference complaint from a public safety/CII licensee shall respond to such complaint consistent with the interference resolution procedures set forth in this chapter.

          § 90.674   Interference resolution procedures.

#### § § 90.674

          (a)  Any non-cellular licensee operating in the 806-824/851-869 MHz band who reasonably believes it is receiving unacceptable interference, as described in § 90.672, shall provide an initial notification of the interference incident. This initial notification of an interference incident shall be sent to all part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees and ESMR licensees who operate cellular base stations (“cell sites”) within 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) of the interference incident.

          (1) The initial notification of interference shall include the following information on interference:

          (i) The specific geographical location where the interference occurs, and the time or times at which the interference occurred or is occurring;

          (ii) A description of its scope and severity, including its source, if known;

          (iii) The relevant Commission licensing information of the party suffering the interference; and

          (iv) A single point of contact for the party suffering the interference.

          (2) ESMR licensees, in conjunction with part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees, shall establish an electronic means of receiving the initial notification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The electronic system must be designed so that all appropriate 800 MHz ESMR and part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees can be contacted about the interference incident with a single notification. The electronic system for receipt of initial notification of interference complaints must be operating no later than February 22, 2005.

          (3) ESMR licensees must respond to the initial notification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours of receipt of notification from a public safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 48 hours after receipt from other non-cellular licensees provided affected communications on these systems are not safety related.

          (b)  ESMR licensees—who receive an initial notification described in paragraph (a) of this section—shall perform a timely analysis of the interference to identify the possible source. Immediate on-site visits may be conducted when necessary to complete timely analysis. Interference analysis must be completed and corrective action initiated within 48 hours of the initial complaint from a public safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 96 hours after the initial complaint from other non-cellular licensees provided affected communications on these systems are not safety related. Corrective action may be delayed if the affected licensee agrees in writing (which may be, but is not required to be, recorded via e-mail or other electronic means) to a longer period.

          (c)  (1) All 800 MHz cellular system licensees and part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees who are responsible for causing unacceptable interference shall take all affirmative measures to resolve such interference. 800 MHz cellular system licensees found to contribute to harmful interference, as defined in § 90.672, shall resolve such interference in the shortest time practicable. 800 MHz cellular system licensees and part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees must provide all necessary test apparatus and technical personnel skilled in the operation of such equipment as may be necessary to determine the most appropriate means of timely eliminating the interference. However, the means whereby interference is abated or the cell parameters that may need to be adjusted is left to the discretion of involved 800 MHz cellular system licensees and/or part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees, whose affirmative measures may include, but not be limited to, the following techniques:

          (i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety signal;

          (ii) Decreasing the power of the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone signal;

          (iii) Modifying the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone systems antenna height;

          (vi) Permanently changing ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone system frequencies; and

          (vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected public safety licensee(s). If this technique is used, in all circumstances, the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees shall be responsible for all costs thereof.

          (2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove inadequate, the affected licensee shall, consistent with but not compromising safety, make all necessary concessions to accepting interference until a longer-term remedy can be implemented.

          (3)  When a public safety licensee determines that a continuing presence of interference constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, the licensee causing the interference must discontinue the associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be identified and applied. The determination that a continuing presence exists that constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, must be made by written statement that:

          (i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the affected public safety licensee;

          (ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and imminent danger;

          (iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or belief after due diligence;

          (iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and

          (v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.

          § 90.675   Information exchange.

#### § § 90.675

          (a)  Public safety/CII licensees may notify an ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee that they wish to receive prior notification of the activation or modification of ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone cell sites in their area. Thereafter, the ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee must provide the following information to the public safety/CII licensee at least 10 business days before a new cell site is activated or an existing cell site is modified:

          (1) Location;

          (2) Effective radiated power;

          (3) Antenna height;

          (4) Channels available for use.

          (b)  The coordination of cell sites is for informational purposes only: public safety/CII licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed cell or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:

          (1) Allow a public safety/CII licensee to advise the ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee whether it believes a proposed cell will generate unacceptable interference;

          (2) Permit ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees to make voluntary changes in cell parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and

          (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the cell is activated.

          (c)  (1) Upon request by an ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee, public safety/CII licensees who operate radio systems in the 806-824/851-869 MHz shall provide the operating parameters of their radio system to the ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee.

          (2) Public safety licensees who perform the information exchange as described in this section must notify the appropriate ESMR and part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees prior to any technical changes to their radio system.

          (1) The EA licensee affords protection, in accordance with § 90.621(b), to all previously authorized co-channel stations that are not associated with another EA license;

          (2) The EA licensee complies with any rules and international agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified in their spectrum block, including the provisions of § 90.619 relating to U.S./Canadian and U.S./Mexican border areas;

          (3) The EA licensee limits the field strength of its base stations at any location on the border of the EA service area in accordance with § 90.689;

          (4) Upon request by an incumbent licensee or the Commission, the EA licensees shall furnish the technical parameters, location and coordinates of the completion of the addition, removal, relocation or modification of any of its facilities within the EA. The EA licensee must provide such information within ten (10) days of receiving a written request.

          (5) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the requirements of § 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Forn 854) with the FCC, WTB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325.

          (6) Any additional transmitters placed in operation must not have a significant environmental effect as defined by §§ 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.

          (b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized co-channel station within the EA licensee's spectrum block is terminated or revoked, the EA licensee's co-channel obligations to such station will cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's official licensing records, and the EA licensee then will be able to construct and operate without regard to that previous authorization.

          § 90.685   Authorization, construction and implementation of EA licenses.

#### § § 90.685

          (a) EA licenses in the 809-824/854-869 MHz band will be issued for a term not to exceed ten years.

          (b) EA licensees in the 809-824/854-869 MHz band must, within three years of the grant of their initial license, construct and place into operation a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at least one-third of the population of its EA-based service area. Further, each EA licensee must provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the population of the EA-based service area within five years of the grant of their initial license. EA-based licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to their markets within five years of the grant of their initial license. Substantial service shall be defined as: “Service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service.”

          (c)  In addition to the population coverage requirements described in this section, we will require EA licensees in Channel blocks A, B and C in the 816-821/861-866 MHz band to construct 50 percent of the total channels included in their spectrum block in at least one location in their respective EA-based service area within three years of initial license grant and to retain such channel usage for the remainder of the construction period.

          (d) An EA licensee's failure to meet the population coverage requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, will result in forfeiture of the entire EA license. Forfeiture of the EA license, however, would not result in the loss of any constructed facilities authorized to the licensee prior to the date of the commencement of the auction for the EA licenses.

          (e) EA licensees operating on channels listed in § 90.614(b) and (c) must implement an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) system—as defined in § 90.7—on their EA license and any associated site-based licenses prior to the expiration date of the EA license. EA licensees operating on these channels shall follow the construction notification procedures set forth in § 1.946(d) of this chapter. Failure to implement an ESMR system on their EA and site-based licenses before the expiration date of the EA license will result in termination of the EA license and any associated site-based licenses pursuant to § 1.946(c) of this chapter.

          § 90.691   Emission mask requirements for EA-based systems.

#### § § 90.691

          (a) Out-of-band emission requirement shall apply only to the “outer” channels included in an EA license and to spectrum adjacent to interior channels used by incumbent licensees. The emission limits are as follows:

          (1) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block by up to and including 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 116 Log(f/6.1) decibels or 50 + **10** Log(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 12.5 kHz.

          (2) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block greater than 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 43 + *10*Log(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 37.5 kHz.

          (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.

          § 90.693   Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

#### § § 90.693

          (a)  These provisions apply to “incumbent licensees,” all 800 MHz licensees authorized in the 809-821/854-866 MHz band who obtained licenses or filed applications on or before December 15, 1995.

          (b)  An incumbent licensee's service area shall be defined by its originally licensed 40 dBμV/m field strength contour and its interference contour shall be defined as its originally-licensed 22 dBμV/m field strength contour. The “originally-licensed” contour shall be calculated using the maximum ERP and the actual height of the antenna above average terrain (HAAT) along each radial. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or modify transmitter sites within their original 22 dBμV/m field strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so long as their original 22 dBμV/m field strength contour is not expanded. Incumbent licensee protection extends only to its 40 dBμV/m signal strength contour. Pursuant to the minor modification notification procedures set forth in 1.947(b), the incumbent licensee must notify the Commission within 30 days of any change in technical parameters for stations that are authorized under a waiver of 90.621(b)(4), or that are authorized under 90.621(b)(5).

          (c) Special provisions for spectrum blocks F1 through V. Incumbent licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dBμV/m signal strength interference contour shall have their service area defined by their originally-licensed 36 dBμV/m field strength contour and their interference contour shall be defined as their originally-licensed 18 dBμV/m field strength contour. The “originally-licensed” contour shall be calculated using the maximum ERP and the actual HAAT along each radial. Incumbent licensees seeking to utilize an 18 dBμV/m signal strength interference contour shall first seek to obtain the consent of affected co-channel incumbents. When the consent of a co-channel licensee is withheld, an incumbent licensee may submit to any certified frequency coordinator an engineering study showing that interference will not occur, together with proof that the incumbent licensee has sought consent. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or modify transmitter sites within their original 18 dBμV/m field strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so long as their original 18 dBμV/m field strength contour is not expanded. Incumbent licensee protection extends only to its 36 dBμV/m signal strength contour. Pursuant to the minor modification notification procedures set forth in 1.947(b), the incumbent licensee must notify the Commission within 30 days of any change in technical parameters for stations that are authorized under a waiver of 90.621(b)(4), or that are authorized under 90.621(b)(5).

          (d) —(1)  Incumbent licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant of EA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and overlapping 40 dBµV/m field strength contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific information on Form 601 for each of their external base sites after the close of the 800 MHz SMR auction. The incumbent's geographic license area is defined by the contiguous and overlapping 22 dBµV/m contours of its constructed and operational external base stations and interior sites that are constructed within the construction period applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic license is issued, facilities that are added within an incumbent's existing footprint and that are not subject to prior approval by the Commission will not be subject to construction requirements.

          (2)  Incumbent licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dBµV/m signal strength interference contour operating at multiple sites may, after grant of EA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for a single license. This single site license will authorize operations throughout the contiguous and overlapping 36 dBµV/m field strength contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific information on Form 601 for each of their external base sites after the close of the 800 SMR auction. The incumbent's geographic license area is defined by the contiguous and overlapping 18 dBµV/m contours of its constructed and operational external base stations and interior sites that are constructed within the construction period applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic license is issued, facilities that are added within an incumbent's existing footprint and that are not subject to prior approval by the Commission will not be subject to construction requirements.

          § 90.699   Transition of the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz band to EA licensing.

#### § § 90.699

          In order to facilitate provision of service throughout an EA, an EA licensee may relocate incumbent licensees in its EA by providing “comparable facilities” on other frequencies in the 800 MHz band. Such relocation is subject to the following provisions:

          (a)-(c) [Reserved]

          (d)  The replacement system provided to an incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent to the existing 800 MHz system with respect to the following four factors:

          (1)  System is defined functionally from the end user's point of view ( a system is comprised of base station facilities that operate on an integrated basis to provide service to a common end user, and all mobile units associated with those base stations). A system may include multiple-licensed facilities that share a common switch or are otherwise operated as a unitary system, provided that the end user has the ability to access all such facilities. A system may cover more than one EA if its existing geographic coverage extends beyond the EA borders.

          (2)  To meet the comparable facilities requirement, an EA licensee must relocate the incumbent to facilities that provide equivalent channel capacity. We define channel capacity as the same number of channels with the same bandwidth that is currently available to the end user. For example, if an incumbent's system consists of five 50 kHz (two 25 kHz paired frequencies) channels, the replacement system must also have five 50 kHz channels. If a different channel configuration is used, it must have the same overall capacity as the original configuration. Comparable channel capacity requires equivalent signaling capability, baud rate, and access time. In addition, the geographic coverage of the channels must be coextensive with that of the original system.

          (3)  Comparable facilities must provide the same quality of service as the facilities being replaced. Quality of service is defined to mean that the end user enjoys the same level of interference protection on the new system as on the old system. In addition, where voice service is provided, the voice quality on the new system must be equal to the current system. Finally, reliability of service is considered to be integral to defining quality of service. Reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within the system. Reliability is a function of equipment failures (e.g., transmitters, feed lines, antennas, receivers, battery back-up power, etc.) and the availability of the frequency channel due to propagation characteristics (e.g., frequency, terrain, atmospheric conditions, radio-frequency noise, etc.) For digital data systems, this will be measured by the percent of time the bit error rate exceeds the desired value. For analog or digital voice transmissions, this will be measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice system the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and reliability will be considered.

          (4)  Operating costs are those costs that affect the delivery of services to the end user. If the EA licensee provides facilities that entail higher operating cost than the incumbent's previous system, and the cost increase is a direct result of the relocation, the EA licensee must compensate the incumbent for the difference. Costs associated with the relocation process can fall into several categories. First, the incumbent must be compensated for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilitates (e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees). Second, increased maintenance costs must be taken into consideration when determining whether operating costs are comparable. For example, maintenance costs associated with analog systems may be higher than the costs of digital equipment because manufacturers are producing mostly digital equipment and analog replacement parts can be difficult to find. An EA licensee's obligation to pay increased operating costs will end five years after relocation has occurred.

          (e)-(f) [Reserved]

          (a) A nationwide licensee authorized pursuant to § 90.717(a) may construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base stations, or fixed stations, anywhere in the Nation, and transmit on any of its authorized channels, provided that the licensee complies with the requirements of § 90.733(i).

          (b) An EA or Regional licensee authorized pursuant to § 90.761 may construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base stations, or fixed stations, anywhere within its authorized EA or REAG, and transmit on any of its authorized channels, provided that:

          (1) The licensee affords protection to all authorized co-channel Phase I non-nationwide base stations as follows:

          (i) The EA or Regional licensee must locate its land mobile or paging base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station transmit frequencies, at least 120 km from the land mobile or paging base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station transmit frequencies, of co-channel Phase I licensees, except that separations of less than 120 km shall be considered on a case-by-case basis upon submission by the EA or Regional licensee of:

          (A) A technical analysis demonstrating at least 10 dB protection to the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I licensee,  demonstrating that the predicted 28 dBu interfering contour of the EA or Regional licensee's base station or fixed station does not overlap the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I licensee's base station or fixed station; or

          (B) A written letter from the co-channel Phase I licensee consenting to a separation of less than 120 km, or to less than 10 dB protection to the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the licensee's base station or fixed station.

          (ii) The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 dBu service contour referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using the F(50,50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential, and is based on the licensee's authorized effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain. The EA or Regional licensee's predicted 28 dBu interfering contour referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using the F(50,10) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential.

          (2) The licensee complies with the requirements of § 90.733(i).

          (3) The licensee limits the field strength of its base stations, or fixed stations operating on base station transmit frequencies, in accordance with the provisions of § 90.771.

          (4) Upon request by a licensee or the Commission, an EA or regional licensee shall furnish the technical parameters, location and coordinates of the completion of the addition, removal, relocation or modification of any of its facilities within the EA or region. The EA or regional licensee must provide such information within ten (10) days of receiving written notification.

          (c) In the event that the authorization for a co-channel Phase I base station, or fixed station transmitting on base station transmit frequencies, within an EA or Regional licensee's border is terminated or revoked, the EA or Regional licensee's channel obligations to such stations will cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's official licensing records, and the EA or Regional licensee then will be able to construct and operate without regard to the previous authorization.

          (a) A nationwide licensee must construct a sufficient number of base stations (, base stations for land mobile and/or paging operations) to provide coverage to a composite area of at least 750,000 square kilometers or 37.5 percent of the United States population within five years of the issuance of its initial license and a composite area of at least 1,500,000 square kilometers or 75 percent of the United States population within ten years of the issuance of its initial license. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to their licensed areas at the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks.

          (b) Licensees must notify the Commission in accordance with § 1.946 of this chapter of compliance with the Construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c) Failure by a nationwide licensee to meet the construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable, will result in automatic cancellation of its entire nationwide license. In such instances, nationwide licenses will not be converted to individual, site-by-site authorizations for already constructed stations.

          (d) Nationwide licensees will not be required to construct and place in operation, or commence service on, all of their authorized channels at all of their base stations or fixed stations.

#### § § 90.711

        (a) Phase II applications for authorizations on Channels 166 through 170 and Channels 181 through 185 will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. When multiple applications are filed on the same day for these frequencies in the same geographic area, and insufficient frequencies are available to grant all applications (i.e., if all applications were granted, violation of the station separation provisions of § 90.723(k) of this part would result), these applications will be considered mutually exclusive.

        (1) All applications will first be considered to determine whether they are substantially complete and acceptable for filing. If so, they will be assigned a file number and put in pending status. If not, they will be dismissed.

        (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all applications in pending status will be processed in the order in which they are received, determined by the date on which the application was received by the Commission in its Gettysburg, Pennsylvania office (or the address set forth at § 1.1102 of this chapter for applications requiring the fees established by part 1, subpart G of this chapter).

        (3) Each application that is accepted for filing will then be reviewed to determine whether it can be granted. Frequencies will be assigned by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of § 90.723.

        (4) An application which is dismissed will lose its place in the processing line.

        (b) All applications for Channels 161 through 165 that comply with the applicable rules of this part shall be granted. Licensees operating on such channels shall cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies and resolve any instances of interference in accordance with the provisions of § 90.173.

        (c) Phase II applications for authorization on all non-Government channels other than Channels 161 through 170 and 181 through 185 shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of subpart W of this part.

        § 90.733   Permissible operations.

#### § § 90.733

        (a) Systems authorized in the 220-222 MHz band may be used:

        (1)(i) For government and non-government land mobile operations,  for base/mobile and mobile relay transmissions, on a primary basis; or

        (ii) For the following operations instead of or in addition to a licensee's land mobile operations: One-way or two-way paging operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees, fixed operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees and all Government licensees, one-way or two-way paging or fixed operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase I licensees, except that before a non-Government Phase I licensee may operate one-way or two-way paging or fixed systems on a primary basis instead of or in addition to its land mobile operations, it must meet the following requirements:

        (A) A nationwide Phase I licensee must;

        () Meet its two-year benchmark for the construction of its land mobile system base stations as prescribed in § 90.725(a); and

        () Provide a new 10-year schedule, as required in § 90.713(b)(3), for the construction of the fixed and/or paging system it intends to construct instead of, or in addition to, its nationwide land mobile system; and

        () Certify that the financial showings and all other certifications provided in demonstrating its ability to construct and operate its nationwide land mobile system, as required in §§ 90.71_3_ (b), (c) and (d), remain applicable to the nationwide system it intends to construct consisting of fixed and/or paging operations on a primary basis instead of, or in addition to, its land mobile operations; or

        () In lieu of providing the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A)() of this section, provide the financial showings and all other certifications required in §§ 90.71_3_ (b), (c) and (d) to demonstrate its ability to construct and operate a nationwide system consisting of fixed and/or paging operations on a primary basis instead of, or in addition to, its land mobile operations.

        (B) A non-nationwide Phase I licensee must first meet the requirement to construct its land mobile base station and place it in operation, or commence service (in accordance with § 90.167) as prescribed in § 90.725(f) or § 90.727, as applicable.

        (2) Only by persons who are eligible for facilities under either this subpart or in the pools included in subpart B or C of this part.

        (3) Except for licensees classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter, only for the transmission of messages or signals permitted in the services in which the participants are eligible.

        (b) See § 90.720 of this part for permissible operations on mutual aid channels.

        (c) For operations requiring less than a 4 kHz bandwidth, more than a single emission may be utilized within the authorized bandwidth. In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of § 90.213 do not apply, but the out-of-band emission limits of § 90.210(f) must be met.

        (d) Licensees, except for licensees authorized on Channels 161 through 170 and 181 through 185, may combine any number of their authorized, contiguous channels (including channels derived from multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz.

        (e) In combining authorized, contiguous channels (including channels derived from multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz, the emission limits in § 90.210(f) must be met only at the outermost edges of the contiguous channels. Transmitters shall be tested to confirm compliance with this requirement with the transmission located as close to the band edges as permitted by the design of the transmitter. The frequency stability requirements in § 90.213 shall apply only to the outermost of the contiguous channels authorized to the licensee. However, the frequency stability employed for transmissions operating inside the outermost contiguous channels must be such that the emission limits in § 90.210(f) are met over the temperature and voltage variations prescribed in § 2.995 of this chapter.

        (f) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee operating a paging base station, or a fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band, may only operate such stations at the coordinates of the licensee's authorized land mobile base station.

        (g) The transmissions of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee's paging base station, or fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band, must meet the requirements of §§ 90.723(d), (g), (h), and (k), and 90.729, and such a station must operate at the effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain prescribed in the licensee's land mobile base station authorization.

        (h) Licensees using 220-222 MHz spectrum for geophysical telemetry operations are authorized to operate fixed stations on a secondary, non-interference basis to licensees operating in the 220-222 MHz band on a primary basis under the conditions that such licensees:

        (1) Provide notification of their operations to co-channel non-nationwide Phase I licensees with an authorized base station, or fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band, located within 45 km of the secondary licensee's station, to co-channel, Phase II EA or Regional licensee authorized to operate in the EA or REAG in which the secondary licensee's station is located, and to co-channel Phase I or Phase II nationwide licensees;

        (2) Operate only at temporary locations in accordance with the provisions of § 1.931 of this chapter;

        (3) Not transmit at a power level greater than one watt ERP;

        (4) Not transmit from an antenna higher than 2 meters (6.6 feet) above ground; and

        (5) Not operate on Channels 111 through 120, 161 through 170, or 181 through 185.

        (i) All licensees constructing and operating base stations or fixed stations on frequencies in the 220-222 MHz band must:

        (1) Comply with any rules and international agreements that restrict use of their authorized frequencies, including the provisions of § 90.715 relating to U.S./Mexican border areas;

        (2) Comply with the provisions of § 17.6 of this chapter with regard to antenna structures; and

        (3) Comply with the provisions of §§ 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter with regard to actions that may or will have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

        (a) Except for nationwide systems authorized in the 220-222 MHz band, station identification is required pursuant to § 90.425 of this part.

        (b) Trunked systems shall employ an automatic device to transmit the call sign of the base station at 30 minute intervals. The identification shall be made on the lowest frequency in the base station trunked group assigned to the licensee. If this frequency is in use at the time identification is required, the identification may be made at the termination of the communication in progress on this frequency.

        (c) Station identification may be by voice or International Morse Code. If the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute, and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, with the tone frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.

        (d) Digital transmissions may also be identified by digital transmission of the station call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner must provide the Commission, upon its request, information (such as digital codes and algorithms) sufficient to decipher the data transmission to ascertain the call sign transmitted.

        § 90.745   Phase I licensee service areas.

#### § § 90.745

        (a) A Phase I licensee's service area shall be defined by the predicted 38 dBu service contour of its authorized base station or fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band at its initially authorized location or at the location authorized in accordance with §§ 90.751, 90.753, 90.755 and 90.757 if the licensee has sought modification of its license to relocate its initially authorized base station. The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 dBu service contour is calculated using the F(50,50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in § 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential, and is based on the authorized effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height-above-average-terrain of the licensee's base station or fixed station. Phase I licensees are permitted to add, remove, or modify transmitter sites within their existing service area without prior notification to the Commission so long as their predicted 38 dBu service contour is not expanded. The incumbent licensee must, however, notify the Commission within 30 days of the completion of any changes in technical parameters or additional stations constructed through a minor modification of its license. Such notification must be made by submitting the appropriate FCC form and must include the appropriate filing fee, if any. These minor modification applications are not subject to public notice and petition to deny requirements or mutually exclusive applications.

        (b) Phase I licensees holding authorizations for service areas that are contiguous and overlapping may exchange these authorizations for a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and overlapping service areas. Phase I licensees exercising this license exchange option must submit specific information for each of their external base station sites.

        (a)  Parties seeking approval for partitioning and disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of a license pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter.

        (b) —(1)  In the case of partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 degrees along the partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area is utilized ( Major Trading Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan Service Area, Rural Service Area or Economic Area) or county lines are followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). Applicants may supply geographical coordinates based on 1983 North American Datum (NAD83) in addition to those required (NAD27). In the case where an FCC recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that constitute the partitioned area.

        (2)  Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.

        (3)  The Commission will consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.

        (c) —(1)  When a winning bidder elects to pay for its license through an installment payment plan pursuant to § 90.812, and partitions its licensed area or disaggregates spectrum to another party, the outstanding balance owed by the licensee on its installment payment plan (including accrued and unpaid interest) shall be apportioned between the licensee and partitionee or disaggregatee. Both parties will be responsible for paying their proportionate share of the outstanding balance to the U.S. Treasury. In the case of partitioning, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the population of the partitioned area to the population of the entire original license area calculated based upon the most recent census data. In the case of disaggregation, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated to the licensed area.

        (2)  (i) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata amount within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will result in a rescission of the grant of the partial assignment application.

        (ii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro rata share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing documents (promissory note, security agreement) with a revised payment obligation, based on the remaining amount of time on the original installment payment schedule. These financing documents will replace the licensee's existing financing documents which shall be marked “superseded” and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the new financing documents. The original interest rate, established pursuant to § 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the licensee's portion of the remaining government obligation. The Commission will require, as a further condition to approval of the partial assignment application, that the licensee execute and return to the U.S. Treasury the new financing documents within 30 days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.

        (iii) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only affect the licensee's portion of the market.

        (3)  (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining government obligation, as calculated according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents (promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.

        § 90.1215   Power limits.

#### § § 90.1215

        Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the transmitting power of stations operating in the 4940-4990 MHz band must not exceed the maximum limits in this section.

        (a)(1) For base, mobile, and temporary fixed operations, the maximum conducted output power must not exceed:

        (2) High power devices are also limited to a peak power spectral density of 21 dBm per one MHz. High power devices using channel bandwidths other than those listed above are permitted; however, they are limited to peak power spectral density of 21 dBm/MHz. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 9 dBi are used, both the maximum conducted output power and the peak power spectral density should be reduced by the amount in decibels that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 9 dBi. However, high power point-to-point and point-to-multipoint operations (both fixed and temporary-fixed rapid deployment) may employ transmitting antennas with directional gain up to 26 dBi without any corresponding reduction in the maximum conducted output power or spectral density. Corresponding reduction in the maximum conducted output power and peak power spectral density should be the amount in decibels that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 26 dBi.

        (b) Low power devices are also limited to a peak power spectral density of 8 dBm per one MHz. Low power devices using channel bandwidths other than those listed above are permitted; however, they are limited to a peak power spectral density of 8 dBm/MHz. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 9 dBi are used, both the maximum conducted output power and the peak power spectral density should be reduced by the amount in decibels that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 9 dBi.

        (c) The maximum conducted output power is measured as a conducted emission over any interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an RMS-equivalent voltage. If the device cannot be connected directly, alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission may be used. The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true maximum conducted output power measurement conforming to the definitions in this paragraph for the emission in question.

        (d) The peak power spectral density is measured as conducted emission by direct connection of a calibrated test instrument to the equipment under test. If the device cannot be connected directly, alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission may be used. Measurements are made over a bandwidth of one MHz or the 26 dB emission bandwidth of the device, whichever is less. A resolution bandwidth less than the measurement bandwidth can be used, provided that the measured power is integrated to show total power over the measurement bandwidth. If the resolution bandwidth is approximately equal to the measurement bandwidth, and much less than the emission bandwidth of the equipment under test, the measured results shall be corrected to account for any difference between the resolution bandwidth of the test instrument and its actual noise bandwidth.

        (e) The ratio of the peak excursion of the modulation envelope (measured using a peak hold function) to the maximum conducted output power shall not exceed 13 dB across any 1 MHz bandwidth or the emission bandwidth whichever is less.

        (f) The transmitting power of permanent fixed point-to-point and point-to-multipoint stations operating in the 4940-4990 MHz band must not exceed the maximum limits in this paragraph (f). Moreover, applicants should request no more power than necessary for a particular use.

        (1) The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to an isotropic radiator, must not exceed 55 dBW (85 dBm).

        (2) For path lengths shorter than 17 kilometers, the EIRP shall not exceed the value derived from the following equation: New EIRP limit = 55 dBW—40*log(17/B) dBW, where B = the actual path length in kilometers.

#### § § 90.1321

        (a) Base and fixed stations are limited to 25 watts/25 MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP). In any event, the peak EIRP power density shall not exceed 1 Watt in any one-megahertz slice of spectrum.

        (b) In addition to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, transmitters operating in the 3650-3700 MHz band that emit multiple directional beams, simultaneously or sequentially, for the purpose of directing signals to individual receivers or to groups of receivers provided the emissions comply with the following:

        (1) Different information must be transmitted to each receiver.

        (2) If the transmitter employs an antenna system that emits multiple directional beams but does not emit multiple directional beams simultaneously, the total output power conducted to the array or arrays that comprise the device, , the sum of the power supplied to all antennas, antenna elements, staves, etc. and summed across all carriers or frequency channels, shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable. The directional antenna gain shall be computed as follows:

        (i) The directional gain, in dBi, shall be calculated as the sum of 10 log (number of array elements or staves) plus the directional gain, in dBi, of the individual element or stave having the highest gain.

        (ii) A lower value for the directional gain than that calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will be accepted if sufficient evidence is presented, e.g., due to shading of the array or coherence loss in the beam-forming.

        (3) If a transmitter employs an antenna that operates simultaneously on multiple directional beams using the same or different frequency channels and if transmitted beams overlap, the power shall be reduced to ensure that the aggregate power from the overlapping beams does not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the aggregate power transmitted simultaneously on all beams shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by more than 8 dB.

        (a)  Parties seeking Commission approval of geographic partitioning or spectrum disaggregation of 218-219 MHz Service system licenses shall request an authorization for partial assignment of license pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter.

        (b) —(1)  In the case of partitioning, requests for authorization of partial assignment of a license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 seconds along the partitioned service area unless an FCC-recognized service area ( Economic Areas) is utilized or county lines are followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds, to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that constitute the partitioned area.

        (2)  Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.

        (3)  The Commission will consider requests for partial assignments of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.

        (c) —(1)  (i) When a winning bidder (partitionor or disaggregator) that elected to pay for its license through an installment payment plan partitions its license or disaggregates spectrum to another party (partitionee or disaggregatee) that would not qualify for an installment payment plan, or elects not to pay for its share of the license through installment payments, the outstanding principal balance owed by the partitionor or disaggregator shall be apportioned according to § 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter. The partitionor or disaggregator is responsible for accrued and unpaid interest through and including the consummation date.

        (ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire  amount of the outstanding principal balance on or before the consummation date. Failure to meet this condition will result in cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.

        (iii) The partitionor or disaggregator shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro rata share of the outstanding balance and, if applicable, shall receive loan documents evidencing the partitioning and disaggregation. The original interest rate, established pursuant to § 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the partitionor's or disaggregator's portion of the remaining government obligation.

        (iv) A default on the partitionor's or disaggregator's payment obligation will affect only the partitionor's or disaggregator's portion of the market.

        (2)  (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining government obligation.

        (ii) Each party may be required, as a condition to approval of the partial assignment application, to execute loan documents agreeing to pay its  portion of the outstanding principal balance due, as apportioned according to § 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter, based upon the installment payment terms for which it qualifies under the rules. Failure by either party to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant to § 1.2110(f)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license for its portion of the partitioned market.

        (iii) A default on an obligation will affect only that portion of the market area held by the defaulting party.

#### § § 95.2509

        Operation of Medical Body Area Network (MBAN) devices is subject to the frequency coordination procedures in this section.

        (a) The FCC will designate a frequency coordinator(s) to manage the operation of medical body area networks by eligible health care facilities.

        (b) The frequency coordinator shall perform the following functions:

        (1) Register health care facilities that operate MBAN transmitters, maintain a database of these MBAN transmitter locations and operational parameters, and provide the FCC with information contained in the database upon request;

        (2) Determine if an MBAN is within line-of-sight of an Aeronautical Mobile Telemetry (AMT) receive facility in the 2360-2390 MHz band and coordinate MBAN operations with the designated AMT frequency coordinator, as specified in § 87.305 of this chapter;

        (3) Notify a registered health care facility when an MBAN has to change frequency within the 2360-2390 MHz band or to cease operating in the band, consistent with a coordination agreement between the MBAN and AMT frequency coordinators;

        (4) Develop procedures to ensure that registered health care facilities operate an MBAN consistent with the coordination requirements under this section; and,

        (5) Identify the MBAN that is the source of interference in response to a complaint from the AMT coordinator and notify the health care facility of alternative frequencies available for MBAN use or to cease operation consistent with the rules.

        (c)  Prior to operating MBAN devices that are capable of operation in the 2360-2390 MHz band, a health care facility must register with a frequency coordinator designated under § 95.2509. Operation of MBAN devices in the 2360-2390 MHz band is prohibited prior to the MBAN coordinator notifying the health care facility that registration and coordination (to the extent coordination is required under paragraph (e) of this section) is complete. The registration must include the following information:

        (1) Specific frequencies or frequency range(s) within the 2360-2390 MHz band to be used, and the capabilities of the MBAN equipment to use the 2390-2400 MHz band;

        (2) Equivalent isotropically radiated power;

        (3) Number of MedRadio programmer/control transmitters in use at the health care facility as of the date of registration, including manufacturer name(s) and model number(s) and FCC identification number(s);

        (4) Legal name of the health care facility;

        (5) Location of MedRadio programmer/control transmitters (e.g., geographic coordinates, street address, building);

        (6) Point of contact for the health care facility (e.g., name, title, office address, phone number, fax number, email address); and,

        (7) In the event that an MBAN has to cease operating in all or a portion of the 2360-2390 MHz band due to interference under § 95.2525 or changes in coordination under paragraph (e) of this section, a point of contact (including contractors) for the health care facility that is responsible for ensuring that this change is effected whenever it is required (e.g., name, title, office address, phone number, fax number, email address). The health care facility also must state whether, in such cases, its MBAN operation is capable of defaulting to the 2390-2400 MHz band and that it is responsible for ceasing MBAN operations in the 2360-2390 MHz band or defaulting traffic to other hospital systems.

        (d)  A health care facility shall notify the MBAN frequency coordinator whenever an MBAN programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2390 MHz band is permanently taken out of service, unless it is replaced with transmitter(s) using the same technical characteristics as those reported on the health care facility's registration, which will cover the replacement transmitter(s). A health care facility shall keep the information contained in each registration current and shall notify the MBAN frequency coordinator of any material change to the MBAN's location or operating parameters. In the event that the health care facility proposes to change the MBAN's location or operating parameters, the MBAN coordinator must first evaluate the proposed changes and comply with paragraph (e) of this section as appropriate before the health care facility may operate the MBAN in the 2360-2390 MHz band under changed operating parameters.

        (e)  The MBAN coordinator will determine if an MBAN is within the line-of-sight of an AMT receive facility in the 2360-2390 MHz band and notify the health care facility when it may begin MBAN operations under the applicable procedures below.

        (1) If the MBAN is beyond the line-of-sight of an AMT receive facility, it may operate without prior coordination with the AMT coordinator, provided that the MBAN coordinator provides the AMT coordinator with the MBAN registration information and the AMT frequency coordinator concurs that the MBAN is beyond the line-of-sight prior to the MBAN beginning operations in the band.

        (2) If the MBAN is within line-of-sight of an AMT receive facility, the MBAN frequency coordinator shall achieve a mutually satisfactory coordination agreement with the AMT frequency coordinator prior to the MBAN beginning operations in the band. Such coordination agreement shall provide protection to AMT receive stations consistent with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation ITU-R M.1459, “Protection criteria for telemetry systems in the aeronautical mobile service and mitigation techniques to facilitate sharing with geostationary broadcasting-satellite and mobile-satellite services in the frequency bands 1 452-1 525 and 2 310-2 360 MHz,” May 2000, as adjusted using generally accepted engineering practices and standards that are mutually agreeable to both coordinators to take into account the local conditions and operating characteristics of the applicable AMT and MBAN facilities, and shall specify when the device shall limit its transmissions to segments of the 2360-2390 MHz band or must cease operation in the band.

        (3) If an AMT operator plans to operate a receive site not previously analyzed by the MBAN coordinator to determine line-of-sight to an MBAN facility, the AMT operator shall consider using locations that are beyond the line-of-sight of a registered health care facility. If the AMT operator determines that non-line-of-sight locations are not practical for its purposes, the AMT coordinator shall notify the MBAN coordinator upon no less than 7 days notice that the registered health care facility must cease MBAN operations in the 2360-2390 MHz band, unless the parties can achieve a mutually satisfactory coordination agreement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (f)  The MBAN frequency coordinator shall:

        (1) Provide registration and coordination of MBAN operations to all eligible health care facilities on a non-discriminatory basis;

        (2) Provide MBAN registration and coordination services on a not-for-profit basis;

        (c) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters and medical implant transmitters may not be used to relay information in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands to a receiver that is not a part of the same Medical Micropower Network (MMN). Wireless retransmission of information to a receiver that is not part of the same MMN must be performed using other radio services that operate in spectrum outside of the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands. Notwithstanding the above restrictions, a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter of an MMN may communicate with a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter of another MMN to coordinate transmissions, so as to avoid interference between the two MMNs.

        (d) Medical body-worn transmitters may relay only information in the 2360-2400 MHz band to a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter or another medical body-worn transmitter device that is part of the same Medical Body Area Network (MBAN). A MedRadio programmer/control transmitter must not be used to relay information in the 2360-2400 MHz band to other MedRadio programmer/control transmitters. Wireless retransmission of all other information from an MBAN transmitter to a receiver that is not a part of the same MBAN shall be performed using other radio services that operate in spectrum outside of the 2360-2400 MHz band. Notwithstanding the above restriction, a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2400 MHz band may communicate with another MedRadio programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2400 MHz band to coordinate transmissions so as to avoid interference between the two MBANs.

        (e) Except as provided in § 95.2559(b), no MedRadio implant or body-worn transmitter shall transmit except in response to—

        § 95.2559   MedRadio channel access requirements.

#### § § 95.2559

        To reduce interference and make the most effective use of the MedRadio frequency bands, MedRadio transmitter types must be designed to operate in accordance with the rules in this section.

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all MedRadio programmer/control transmitters operating in the 401-406 MHz band must operate under the control of a monitoring system that incorporates a mechanism for monitoring the channel or channels that the MedRadio system devices intend to occupy. The monitoring system antenna shall be the antenna normally used by the programmer/control transmitter for a MedRadio communications session. Before the monitoring system of a programmer/control transmitter initiates a MedRadio communications session, the following access criteria must be met:

        (1) The monitoring system bandwidth, measured at its 20 dB down points, must be equal to or greater than the MedRadio emission bandwidth of the intended transmission.

        (2) Within 5 seconds prior to initiating a MedRadio communications session, circuitry associated with a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter must monitor the channel or channels the system devices intend to occupy for a minimum of 10 milliseconds per channel.

        (3) The monitoring threshold power level, P in dBm, is calculated using the following formula.

        (i) B is the MedRadio emission bandwidth in Hertz of the MedRadio communications session transmitter having the widest emission; and,

        (ii) G is the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter monitoring system antenna gain, in decibels, relative to the gain of an isotropic antenna (dBi).

        (4) For the purposes of showing compliance with the above provisions, the above calculated threshold power level must be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the monitoring system antenna gain above or below the gain of an isotropic antenna, respectively.

        (5) If no signal above the monitoring threshold power level is detected in a MedRadio channel, the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter may initiate on that channel a MedRadio communications session involving transmissions to and from a medical implant or medical body-worn device. The MedRadio communications session may continue as long as any silent period between consecutive data transmission bursts does not exceed 5 seconds. If no channel meeting the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section is available, MedRadio transmitters that are capable of operating on multiple channels may transmit on the alternate channel accessible by the device with the lowest monitored ambient power level.

        (6) When a channel is selected prior to a MedRadio communications session, it is permissible to select an alternate channel for use if communications are interrupted, provided that the alternate channel selected is the next best choice using the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. The alternate channel may be accessed in the event a communications session is interrupted by interference. The following criteria must be met:

        (i) Before transmitting on the alternate channel, the channel must be monitored for a period of at least 10 milliseconds.

        (ii) The detected power level during this 10 millisecond or greater monitoring period must be no higher than 6 dB above the power level detected when the channel was chosen as the alternate channel.

        (iii) In the event that this alternate channel provision is not used by the MedRadio system, or if the criteria in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this section are not met, a channel must be selected using the access criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

        (7) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, MedRadio transmitters that operate on a single channel and thus do not have the capability of operating on alternate channels may not transmit unless no signal on the single channel of operation exceeds the monitoring threshold power level.

        (b)  MedRadio devices or communications sessions that meet any one of the following criteria are not required to be operated in accordance with the access rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) MedRadio communications sessions that are initiated by a medical implant event.

        (2) MedRadio devices operating in either the 401-401.85 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 250 nanowatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.1%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval, and a maximum of 100 transmissions per hour.

        (3) MedRadio devices operating in the 401.85-402 MHz band, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 25 microwatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.1%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval, and a maximum of 100 transmissions per hour.

        (4) MedRadio devices operating with a total emission bandwidth not exceeding 300 kHz, centered at 403.65 MHz, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 100 nanowatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.01%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval and a maximum of 10 transmissions per hour.

        (c)  The provisions of this section shall not be used to extend the range of spectrum occupied over space or time for the purpose of denying fair access to spectrum for other MedRadio systems.

        (d)  MedRadio programmer/control transmitters must incorporate a mechanism for monitoring the authorized bandwidth of the frequency band that the MedRadio transmitters intend to occupy. The monitoring system antenna shall be the same antenna used by the programmer/control transmitter for a communications session.

        (1) The MedRadio programmer/control transmitter shall be capable of monitoring any occupied frequency band at least once every second and monitoring alternate frequency bands within two seconds prior to executing a change to an alternate frequency band.

        (2) The MedRadio programmer/control transmitter shall move to another authorized frequency band within one second of detecting a persistent ( lasting more than 50 milliseconds) signal level greater than −60 dBm as received by a 0 dBi gain antenna in any 12.5 kHz bandwidth within the authorized bandwidth.

        (3) The MedRadio programmer/control transmitter shall be capable of monitoring the authorized bandwidth of the occupied frequency band to determine whether either direction of the communications link is becoming degraded to the extent that communications is likely to be lost for more than 45 milliseconds. Upon making such a determination the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter shall move to another authorized frequency band.

        (e)  MedRadio transmitters shall incorporate a programmable means to implement a system shutdown process in the event of communication failure, on command from the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter, or when no authorized alternate frequency band is available. The shutdown process shall commence within 45 milliseconds after loss of the communication link or receipt of the shutdown command from the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter. This requirement does not apply to MedRadio operations in the 401-406 MHz band.

        (f)  A MedRadio programmer/control transmitter and its associated medical body-worn transmitters shall not commence operating in, and shall automatically cease operating in, the 2360-2390 MHz band if the programmer/control transmitter does not receive, in accordance with the protocols specified by the manufacturer, a control message permitting such operation. Medical body-worn transmitters shall cease operating in 2360-2390 MHz if they lose communication with their associated programmer/control transmitter. Additionally, a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter and its associated medical body-worn transmitters operating in the 2360-2390 MHz band shall comply with a control message that notifies the devices to limit transmissions to segments of the 2360-2390 MHz band or to cease operation in the band.

        (b) 0 °C to 55 °C in the case of MedRadio programmer/control transmitters and medical body-worn transmitters.

        § 95.2567   MedRadio radiated power limits.

#### § § 95.2567

The reference antenna system requires SAS to calculate antenna gain using § 25.209(a)(1) and (4) of this chapter, and a reference RF filter between the feed-horn and low noise amplifier (LNA)/low noise block downconverter (LNB), with 0.5 dB insertion loss in the passband.

        (3)  The aggregate RF power at the output of a reference RF filter and antenna at the location of an FSS earth station operating in the 3600-3700 MHz band, produced by emissions from all CBSDs (within 40 km), shall not exceed a median RMS value of −60 dBm. The reference antenna system requires an SAS to calculate antenna gain using § 25.209(a)(1) and (4) of this chapter, and a reference RF filter between the feed-horn and LNA/LNB, with a filter mask of 0.6 dB/MHz attenuation to 30.5 dB at 50 MHz offset below the lower edge of the FSS earth station's authorized passband, and 0.25 dB/MHz attenuation to 55.5 dB at an offset greater than or equal to 150 MHz below the lower edge of the FSS earth station's authorized passband.

        (b) Registered FSS earth stations in the 3700-4200 MHz band listed at  shall be protected from CBSD operation in accordance with this section. Only licensed FSS earth stations used for satellite telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) operations will be protected under this section. Other licensed 3700-4200 MHz earth stations may be protected consistent with § 96.17(f).

        (1)  The aggregate passband RF power spectral density at the output of a reference RF filter and antenna at the location of a TT&C FSS earth station operating in the 3700-4200 MHz band, produced by emissions from all CBSDs (within 40 km) operating in the Citizens Band Radio Service shall not exceed a median RMS value of −129 dBm/MHz. The reference antenna system requires SAS to calculate antenna gain using § 25.209(a)(1) and (4) of this chapter, and a reference RF filter between the feed-horn and LNA/LNB, with 0.5 dB insertion loss in the passband.

        (2)  The aggregate RF power at the output of a reference RF filter and antenna at the location of a TT&C FSS earth station operating in the 3700-4200 MHz band, produced by emissions from all CBSDs (within 40 km), shall not exceed a median RMS value of −60 dBm. The reference antenna system requires SAS to calculate antenna gain using § 25.209(a)(1) and (4) of this chapter, and a reference RF filter between the feed-horn and LNA/LNB, with a filter mask of 0.6 dB/MHz attenuation to 30.5 dB at 50 MHz offset below the lower edge of the FSS earth station's authorized passband, and 0.25 dB/MHz attenuation to 55.5 dB at an offset greater than or equal to150 MHz below the lower edge of the FSS earth station's authorized passband.

        (c) These protection criteria will be enforced by the Spectrum Access System authorized consistent with subpart F of this part.

        (d) FSS earth station licensees requesting protection under this part must register with the Commission annually, no later than 30 days before the end of the preceding calendar year, or upon making changes to any of the operational parameters listed in this section. Registration information will be made available to all approved SASs.

        (1) Annual registration for each earth station shall include, at a minimum:

        (i) The earth station's geographic location (Using NAD83 coordinates);

        (ii) Antenna gain;

        (iii) Azimuth and elevation antenna gain pattern;

        (iv) Antenna azimuth relative to true north; and

        (v) Antenna elevation angle.

        (vi) Whether the earth station is used for satellite telemetry, tracking, and control (for earth stations in the 3700-4200 MHz band).

        (2) Such information must be made available to SAS Administrators and maintained consistent with § 96.55.

        (e) CBSDs may operate within areas that may cause interference to FSS earth stations, in excess of the levels described in § 96.17(a) and (b), provided that the licensee of the FSS earth station and the authorized user of the CBSD mutually agree on such operation and the terms of any such agreement are provided to an SAS Administrator that agrees to enforce them. The terms of any such agreement shall be communicated promptly to all other SAS Administrators.

        (f) FSS earth station licensees in the 3600-3700 and 3700-4200 MHz bands may request additional protection from SAS Administrators to prevent harmful interference into their systems. SAS Administrators must establish a process to receive and address such requests, consistent with §§ 96.53(o) and 96.63 and shall make good faith efforts to address interference concerns, consistent with their other responsibilities under this part.

        § 96.25   Priority access licenses.

#### § § 96.25

        (a) Priority Access Licensees must operate CBSDs consistent with the technical rules and interference protection requirements set forth in this part.

        (b) PALs have the following parameters:

        (1)  Each PAL consists of a single License Area.

        (i)  An SAS must assign geographically contiguous PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee to the same channels in each geographic area, to the extent feasible. The SAS may temporarily reassign individual PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee to different channels, so that geographical contiguity is temporarily not maintained, to the extent necessary to protect Incumbent Users or if necessary to perform its required functions under subpart F of this part.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (2)  Each PAL consists of a 10 megahertz channel within the frequency range set forth in § 96.11. Channels must be assigned by the SAS. Priority Access Licensees may request a particular channel or frequency range from the SAS but will not be guaranteed a particular assignment.

        (i)  An SAS must assign multiple channels held by the same Priority Access Licensee to contiguous channels in the same License Area, to the extent feasible. The SAS may temporarily reassign individual PALs to non-contiguous channels to the extent necessary to protect Incumbent Users or if necessary to perform its required functions under subpart F of this part.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (3)  Each PAL has a ten-year license term. Licensees must file a renewal application in accordance with the provisions of § 1.949 of this chapter.

        (4)  Priority Access Licensees must provide substantial service in their license area by the end of the initial license term. “Substantial” service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above the level of mediocre service which might minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license without further Commission action, and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it. Licensees shall demonstrate compliance with the performance requirement by filing a construction notification with the Commission in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 1.946(d) of this chapter. The licensee must certify whether it has met the performance requirement, and file supporting documentation, including description and demonstration of the bona fide service provided, electronic maps accurately depicting the boundaries of the license area and where in the license area the licensee provides service that meets the performance requirement, supporting technical documentation, any population-related assumptions or data used in determining the population covered by a service to the extent any were relied upon, and any other information the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may prescribe by public notice. A licensee's showing of substantial service may not rely on service coverage outside of the PAL Protection Areas of registered CBSDs or on deployments that are not reflected in SAS records of CBSD registrations.

        (i)  A Priority Access Licensee providing a mobile service or point-to-multipoint service may demonstrate substantial service by showing that it provides signal coverage and offers service, either to customers or for internal use, over at least 50 percent of the population in the license area.

        (ii)  A Priority Access Licensee providing a fixed point-to-point service may demonstrate substantial service by showing that it has constructed and operates at least four links, either to customers or for internal use, in license areas with 134,000 population or less and in license areas with greater population, a minimum number of links equal to the population of the license area divided by 33,500 and rounded up to the nearest whole number. To satisfy this provision, such links must operate using registered Category B CBSDs.

        (c)  PAL channels shall be made available for assignment by the SAS for General Authorized Access use only in areas outside of PAL Protection Areas consistent with this section and § 96.41(d).

        (1) A CBSD will be considered to be in use for purposes of calculating a PAL Protection Area once it is registered and authorized for use on a Priority Access basis by an SAS consistent with §§ 96.39, 96.53, and 96.57.

        (i) Priority Access Licensees must inform the SAS if a previously activated CBSD is no longer in use.

        (ii) Any CBSD that does not make contact with the SAS for seven days shall not be considered in use and will be excluded from the calculation of the PAL Protection Area until such time as contact with the SAS is re-established.

        (2) The default protection contour will be determined by the SAS as a −96 dBm/10 MHz contour around each CBSD. The default protection contour will be calculated based on information included in the CBSD registration and shall be determined and enforced consistently across all SASs.

        (i) The default protection contour is the outer limit of the PAL Protection Area for any CBSD but a Priority Access Licensee may choose to self-report protection contours smaller than the default protection contour to the SAS.

        (ii) If the PAL Protection Areas for multiple CBSDs operated by the same Priority Access Licensees overlap, the SAS shall combine the PAL Protection Areas for such CBSDs into a single protection area.

        (3) The PAL Protection Area may not extend beyond the boundaries of the Priority Access Licensee's Service Area.

      Subpart E—Technical Rules

        § 96.39   Citizens Broadband Radio Service Device (CBSD) general requirements.

#### § § 96.39

        This section applies to all CBSDs. Additional rules applicable only to Category A or Category B CBSDs are set forth in §§ 96.43 and 96.45.

        (a)  (1) All CBSDs must be able to determine their geographic coordinates (referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83)) to an accuracy of ±50 meters horizontal and ±3 meters of elevation. Such geographic coordinates shall be reported to an SAS at the time of first activation from a power-off condition.

        (2) For professionally installed CBSDs, geographic coordinates to the same accuracy specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be determined and reported to the SAS as part of the installation and registration process. Geographic coordinates must be determined and reported each time the CBSD is moved to a new location.

        (3) A non-professionally installed CBSD must check its location and report to the SAS any location changes exceeding 50 meters horizontal and ±3 meters elevation from its last reported location within 60 seconds of such location change.

        (b)  All CBSDs must be capable of two-way operation on any authorized frequency assigned by an SAS. Equipment deployed by Grandfathered Wireless Broadband Licensees during their license term will be exempt from this requirement.

        (c)  A CBSD must register with and be authorized by an SAS prior to its initial service transmission. The CBSD must provide the SAS upon its registration with its geographic location, antenna height above ground level (in meters), CBSD class (Category A/Category B), requested authorization status (Priority Access or General Authorized Access), FCC identification number, call sign, user contact information, air interface technology, unique manufacturer's serial number, sensing capabilities (if supported), and additional information on its deployment profile required by §§ 96.43 and 96.45. If any of this information changes, the CBSD shall update the SAS within 60 seconds of such change, except as otherwise set forth in this section. All information provided by the CBSD to the SAS must be true, complete, correct, and made in good faith.

        (1) A CBSD must operate at or below the maximum power level authorized by an SAS, consistent with its FCC equipment authorization, and within geographic areas permitted by an SAS on the channels or frequencies authorized by an SAS.

        (2) A CBSD must receive and comply with any incoming commands from its associated SAS about any changes to power limits and frequency assignments. A CBSD must cease transmission, move to another frequency range, or change its power level within 60 seconds as instructed by an SAS.

        (d)  A CBSD must report to an SAS regarding received signal strength in its occupied frequencies and adjacent frequencies, received packet error rates or other common standard metrics of interference for itself and associated End User Devices as directed by an SAS.

        (e)  If directed by the SAS, a CBSD that receives a range of available frequencies or channels from an SAS must promptly report to the SAS which of the available channels or frequencies it will utilize.

        (f)  CBSDs shall incorporate security measures sufficient to ensure that they are capable of communicating only with SASs operated by approved SAS Administrators, and that communications between CBSDs and SASs, between individual CBSDs, and between CBSDs and End User Devices are secure to prevent corruption or unauthorized interception of data.

        (1) For purposes of obtaining operational limits and frequency availabilities and their updates, CBSDs shall only contact SASs operated by SAS Administrators approved by the Commission in accordance with subpart F of this part.

        (2) All communications between CBSDs and SASs must be transmitted using secure methods that protect the systems from corruption or unauthorized modification of the data.

        (3) Communications between a CBSD and its associated End User Devices for purposes of obtaining operational power, location, and frequency assignments shall employ secure methods that protect the system from corruption or unauthorized modification of the data.

        (g)  All CBSDs and End User Devices must contain security features sufficient to protect against modification of software and firmware by unauthorized parties. Applications for certification of CBSDs and End User Devices must include an operational description of the technologies and measures that are incorporated in the device to comply with the security requirements of this section. In addition, applications for certification of CBSDs and End User Devices must identify at least one of the SAS databases operated by an approved SAS Administrator that the device will access for channel/frequency availability and affirm that the device will conform to the communications security methods used by such databases.

        (h)  Airborne operations by CBSDs and End User Devices are prohibited.

        § 96.41   General radio requirements.

#### § § 96.41

        The requirements in this section apply to CBSDs and their associated End User Devices, unless otherwise specified.

        (a)  Systems operating in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service must use digital modulation techniques.

        (b)  Unless otherwise specified in this section, the maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) and maximum Power Spectral Density (PSD) of any CBSD and End User Device must comply with the limits shown in the table in this paragraph (b):

        (c)  CBSDs and End User Devices shall limit their operating power to the minimum necessary for successful operations.

        (1) CBSDs must support transmit power control capability and the capability to limit their maximum EIRP and the maximum EIRP of associated End User Devices in response to instructions from an SAS.

        (2) End User Devices shall include transmit power control capability and the capability to limit their maximum EIRP in response to instructions from their associated CBSDs.

        (d)  (1) For both Priority Access and GAA users, CBSD transmissions must be managed such that the aggregate received signal strength for all locations within the PAL Protection Area of any co-channel PAL, shall not exceed an average (RMS) power level of −80 dBm in any direction when integrated over a 10 megahertz reference bandwidth, with the measurement antenna placed at a height of 1.5 meters above ground level, unless the affected PAL licensees agree to an alternative limit and communicate that to the SAS.

        (2) These limits shall not apply for co-channel operations at the boundary between geographically adjacent PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee.

        (e) —(1)

        (i) Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for channel and frequency assignments made by the SAS to CBSDs, the conducted power of any CBSD emission outside the fundamental emission bandwidth as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section (whether the emission is inside or outside of the authorized band) shall not exceed −13 dBm/MHz within 0-10 megahertz above the upper SAS-assigned channel edge and within 0-10 megahertz below the lower SAS-assigned channel edge. At all frequencies greater than 10 megahertz above the upper SAS assigned channel edge and less than 10 MHz below the lower SAS assigned channel edge, the conducted power of any CBSD emission shall not exceed −25 dBm/MHz. The upper and lower SAS assigned channel edges are the upper and lower limits of any channel assigned to a CBSD by an SAS, or in the case of multiple contiguous channels, the upper and lower limits of the combined contiguous channels.

        (ii) Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for channel and frequency assignments made by a CBSD to End User Devices, the conducted power of any End User Device emission outside the fundamental emission (whether in or outside of the authorized band) shall not exceed −13 dBm/MHz within 0 to B megahertz (where B is the bandwidth in megahertz of the assigned channel or multiple contiguous channels of the End User Device) above the upper CBSD-assigned channel edge and within 0 to B megahertz below the lower CBSD-assigned channel edge. At all frequencies greater than B megahertz above the upper CBSD assigned channel edge and less than B megahertz below the lower CBSD-assigned channel edge, the conducted power of any End User Device emission shall not exceed −25 dBm/MHz. Notwithstanding the emission limits in this paragraph, the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio for End User Devices shall be at least 30 dB.

        (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for CBSDs and End User Devices, the conducted power of emissions below 3540 MHz or above 3710 MHz shall not exceed −25 dBm/MHz, and the conducted power of emissions below 3530 MHz or above 3720 MHz shall not exceed −40dBm/MHz.

        (3)  (i) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the licensee's authorized frequency channel, a resolution bandwidth of no less than one percent of the fundamental emission bandwidth may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full reference bandwidth ( 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The fundamental emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.

        (ii) When measuring unwanted emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits, the CBSD and End User Device nominal carrier frequency/channel shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's authorized frequency block edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.

        § 97.19   Application for a vanity call sign.

#### § § 97.19

        (a) The person named in an operator/primary station license grant or in a club station license grant is eligible to make application for modification of the license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign selected by the vanity call sign system. Effective February 14, 2011, the person named in a club station license grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by a trustee is not eligible for an additional vanity call sign. (The person named in a club station license grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by a trustee is eligible for a vanity call sign for his or her operator/primary station license grant on the same basis as any other person who holds an operator/primary station license grant.) Military recreation stations are not eligible for a vanity call sign.

        (b) Each application for a modification of an operator/primary or club station license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign selected by the vanity call sign system must be filed in accordance with § 1.913 of this chapter.

        (c) Unassigned call signs are available to the vanity call sign system with the following exceptions:

        (1) A call sign shown on an expired license grant is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the expiration of the license.

        (2) A call sign shown on a surrendered or canceled license grant (except for a license grant that is canceled pursuant to § 97.31) is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the date such action is taken. (The availability of a call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to § 97.31 is governed by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.)

        (i) This 2-year period does not apply to any license grant pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section that is surrendered, canceled, revoked, voided, or set aside because the grantee acknowledged or the Commission determined that the grantee was not eligible for the exception. In such a case, the call sign is not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date such action is taken, or for the period for which the call sign would not have been available to the vanity call sign system pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section but for the intervening grant to the ineligible applicant, whichever is later.

        (ii) An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the call sign was previously assigned is exempt from the 2-year period set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (3) A call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to § 97.31 of this part is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the person's death, or for 2 years following the expiration of the license grant, whichever is sooner. If, however, a license is canceled more than 2 years after the licensee's death (or within 30 days before the second anniversary of the licensee's death), the call sign is not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date such action is taken. The following applicants are exempt from this 2-year period:

        (i) An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the call sign was previously assigned; or

        (ii) An applicant who is the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law of the person now deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the vanity call sign requested by the applicant is from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential call sign system; or

        (iii) An applicant who is a club station license trustee acting with a written statement of consent signed by either the licensee  but who is now deceased, or by at least one relative as listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, of the person now deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the deceased former holder was a member of the club during his or her life.

        (d) The vanity call sign requested by an applicant must be selected from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential call sign system.

        (1) The applicant must request that the call sign shown on the license grant be vacated and provide a list of up to 25 call signs in order of preference. In the event that the Commission receives more than one application requesting a vanity call sign from an applicant on the same receipt day, the Commission will process only the first such application entered into the Universal Licensing System. Subsequent vanity call sign applications from that applicant with the same receipt date will not be accepted.

        (2) The first assignable call sign from the applicant's list will be shown on the license grant. When none of those call signs are assignable, the call sign vacated by the applicant will be shown on the license grant.

        (3) Vanity call signs will be selected from those call signs assignable at the time the application is processed by the FCC.

        (4) A call sign designated under the sequential call sign system for Alaska, Hawaii, Caribbean Insular Areas, and Pacific Insular areas will be assigned only to a primary or club station whose licensee's mailing address is in the corresponding state, commonwealth, or island. This limitation does not apply to an applicant for the call sign as the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law, of the former holder now deceased.

        § 97.119   Station identification.

#### § § 97.119

        (a) Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not authorized to the station.

        (b) The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:

        (1) By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;

        (2) By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;

        (3) By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;

        (4) By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission standards, either color or monochrome, of § 73.682(a) of the FCC Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same image emission

        (c) One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned to another country.

        (d) When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a special event call sign as shown for that station for that period of time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour during such transmissions.

        (e) When the operator license class held by the control operator exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the call sign assigned to the control operator's station must be included after the call sign.

        (f) When the control operator is a person who is exercising the rights and privileges authorized by § 97.9(b) of this part, an indicator must be included after the call sign as follows:

        (1) For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT;

        (2) For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice or Technician to General Class: AG;

        (3) For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class to Amateur Extra Class: AE.

        (g) When the station is transmitting under the authority of § 97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate letter-numeral designating the station location must be included before the call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At least once during each intercommunication, the identification announcement must include the geographical location as nearly as possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.

Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be removed at the spacecraft's end of life, by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy, or through other equivalent procedures specifically disclosed in the application;

        (iv) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of the space station(s) becoming a source of debris by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations.

        (A) Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the following information must also be included:

        () A demonstration that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of collision between any space station of the system and other large objects (_1_0 cm or larger in diameter) during the total orbital lifetime of the space station, including any de-orbit phases, to less than 0.001 (1 in 1,000). The probability shall be calculated using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool. The collision risk may be assumed zero for a space station during any period in which the space station will be maneuvered effectively to avoid colliding with large objects.

        () The statement must identify characteristics of the space station(s)' orbits that may present a collision risk, including any planned and/or operational space stations in those orbits, and indicate what steps, if any, have been taken to coordinate with the other spacecraft or system, or what other measures the operator plans to use to avoid collision.

        () If at any time during the space station(s)' mission or de-orbit phase the space station(s) will transit through the orbits used by any inhabitable spacecraft, including the International Space Station, the statement must describe the design and operational strategies, if any, that will be used to minimize the risk of collision and avoid posing any operational constraints to the inhabitable spacecraft.

        () The statement must disclose the accuracy, if any, with which orbital parameters will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system is not be maintained to specific orbital tolerances, e.g., its propulsion system will not be used for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite or satellites. All systems must describe the extent of satellite maneuverability, whether or not the space station design includes a propulsion system.

        () The space station operator must certify that upon receipt of a space situational awareness conjunction warning, the operator will review and take all possible steps to assess the collision risk, and will mitigate the collision risk if necessary. As appropriate, steps to assess and mitigate the collision risk should include, but are not limited to: Contacting the operator of any active spacecraft involved in such a warning; sharing ephemeris data and other appropriate operational information with any such operator; and modifying space station attitude and/or operations.

        (B) Where a space station requests the assignment of a geostationary orbit location, it must assess whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective satellites might overlap or touch. If so, the statement must include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be taken to prevent collisions.

        (v) A statement addressing the trackability of the space station(s). Space station(s) operating in low-Earth orbit will be presumed trackable if each individual space station is 10 cm or larger in its smallest dimension, exclusive of deployable components. Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the statement shall also disclose the following:

        (A) How the operator plans to identify the space station(s) following deployment and whether space station tracking will be active or passive;

        (B) Whether, prior to deployment, the space station(s) will be registered with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity; and

        (C) The extent to which the space station operator plans to share information regarding initial deployment, ephemeris, and/or planned maneuvers with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity, other entities that engage in space situational awareness or space traffic management functions, and/or other operators.

        (vi) A statement disclosing planned proximity operations, if any, and addressing debris generation that will or may result from the proposed operations, including any planned release of debris, the risk of accidental explosions, the risk of accidental collision, and measures taken to mitigate those risks.

        (vii) A statement detailing the disposal plans for the space station, including the quantity of fuel—if any—that will be reserved for disposal maneuvers. In addition, the following specific provisions apply:

        (A) For geostationary orbit space stations, the statement must disclose the altitude selected for a disposal orbit and the calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude.

        (B) For space stations terminating operations in an orbit in or passing through the low-Earth orbit region below 2,000 km altitude, the statement must disclose whether the spacecraft will be disposed of either through atmospheric re-entry, specifying if direct retrieval of the spacecraft will be used. The statement must also disclose the expected time in orbit for the space station following the completion of the mission.

        (C) For space stations not covered by either paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section, the statement must indicate whether disposal will involve use of a storage orbit or long-term atmospheric re-entry and rationale for the selected disposal plan.

        (D) For all NGSO space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section, the following additional specific provisions apply:

        () The statement must include a demonstration that the probability of success of the chosen disposal method will be 0.9 or greater for any individual space station. For space station systems consisting of multiple space stations, the demonstration should include additional information regarding efforts to achieve a higher probability of success, with a goal, for large systems, of a probability of success for any individual space station of 0.99 or better. For space stations under paragraph (g)(__1__)(vii)(B) of this section that will be terminating operations in or passing through the low-Earth orbit region below 2000 km altitude, successful disposal, for the purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(D)(), is defined as atmospheric re-entry of the spacecraft as soon as practicable, but no later than five years following completion of the mission. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(C) of this section, successful disposal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

        () If planned disposal is by atmospheric re-entry, the statement must also include:

        () A d_i_sclosure indicating whether the atmospheric re-entry will be an uncontrolled re-entry or a controlled targeted reentry.

        () An assessment as to whether portions of any individual spacecraft will survive atmospheric re-entry and impact the surface of the Earth with a kinetic energy in excess of 15 joules, and demonstration that the calculated casualty risk for an individual spacecraft using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool is less than 0.0001 (1 in 10,000).

        (viii) If any material item described in this notification changes before launch, a replacement pre-space notification shall be filed with the Space Bureau no later than 90 days before integration of the space station into the launch vehicle.

        (2) An in-space station notification is required no later than 7 days following initiation of space station transmissions. This notification must update the information contained in the pre-space notification.

        (3) A post-space station notification is required no later than 3 months after termination of the space station transmissions. When termination of transmissions is ordered by the FCC, the notification is required no later than 24 hours after termination of transmissions.

        § 97.307   Emission standards.

#### § § 97.307

        (a) No amateur station transmission shall occupy more bandwidth than necessary for the information rate and emission type being transmitted, in accordance with good amateur practice.

        (b) Emissions resulting from modulation must be confined to the band or segment available to the control operator. Emissions outside the necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or keyclick interference to operations on adjacent frequencies.

        (c) All spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be reduced to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission, including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of the interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the interference, in accordance with good engineering practice.

        (d) For transmitters installed after January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must be at least 43 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For transmitters installed on or before January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 mW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For a transmitter of mean power less than 5 W installed on or before January 1, 2003, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.

        (e) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency between 30-225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean power of the fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power of 25 W or less, the mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission line must not exceed 25 µW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below the power of 10 µW. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.

        (f) The following standards and limitations apply to transmissions on the frequencies specified in § 97.305(c).

        (1) No angle-modulated emission may have a modulation index greater than 1 at the highest modulation frequency.

        (2) No non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the first symbol), or a multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not exceed that of a communications quality A3E emission.

        The ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to that of an isotropic (omnidirectional) radiator in the far field of its main (forward direction) lobe.

        The radio frequency peak or RMS power, as the case may be, supplied to the antenna from the antenna transmission line and its associated impedance matching network.

        The antenna, its supporting structure and anything attached to it.

        The center of the frequency band assigned to a station.

        The frequency band within which the emission of a station is authorized; the width of the band equals the necessary bandwidth plus twice the absolute value of the frequency tolerance.

        The maximum power a station is permitted to use. This power is specified by the Commission in the station's authorization.

        ATPC is a feature of a digital microwave radio system that adjusts the transmitter output power. ATPC allows the transmitter to operate at less than maximum power for most of the time. In a radio employing ATPC, the transmit power is reduced during normal operation conditions. When the receiver detects a reduction in signal level, a control signal is sent to the far end transmitter, instructing it to increase the power output to compensate for the signal reduction. The power output is limited to the licensed (maximum) transmit power. Guidelines for use of ATPC are set forth in the TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, “Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems (TSB 10).”

        The band of frequencies comprising 99 percent of the total radiated power extended to include any discrete frequency on which the power is at least 0.25 percent of the total radiated power.

        Processing of Applications

          § 101.45   Mutually exclusive applications.

#### § § 101.45

          (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other applications. The Commission will presume “harmful electrical interference” exists when the levels of § 101.105 are exceeded, or when there is a material impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.

          (b) A common carrier application, except in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service and in the 24 GHz Service, will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only if:

          (1) The application is mutually exclusive with the other application; and

          (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition acceptable for filing by whichever “cut-off” date is earlier:

          (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or

          (ii) One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission takes final action on the previously filed application (should the Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30) and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).

          (c) Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with the first filed application. (For example, applications A, B, and C are filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively with B, C must be filed within the “cut-off” period established by A even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.)

          (d) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave applications for authorization under this part will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications in accordance with the provisions of § 1.227(b)(4) of this chapter.

          (e) An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one or more previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date prescribed in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section, will be returned without prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final action is taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed application (or applications).

          (f) For purposes of this section, any application (whether mutually exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by § 1.929 of this chapter), except under any of the following circumstances:

          (1) The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or for comparative evaluation (pursuant to § 101.51 of this part), and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant to § 1.927 of this chapter;

          (2) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require resolution by hearing or by comparative evaluation pursuant to § 101.51 provided that the amendment does not create new or additional frequency conflicts;

          (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a requested exemption from the “cut-off” requirements of this section is granted;

          (4) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control which results from an agreement under § 1.935 of this chapter whereby two or more applicants entitled to comparative consideration of their applications join in one (or more) of the existing applications and request dismissal of their other application (or applications) to avoid the delay and cost of comparative consideration;

          (5) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or

          (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such as, for example:

          (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, natural causes, or loss of lease or option;

          (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the erection of a new building or other structure; or

          (iii) The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.

          (g) Applicants for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands shall select a frequency pair. Applicants for these bands may select an unpaired frequency only upon a showing that spectrum efficiency will not be impaired and that unpaired spectrum is not available in other bands. During the initial filing window, frequency coordination is not required, except that an application for a frequency in the 942-944 MHz band must be coordinated to ensure that it does not affect an existing broadcast auxiliary service licensee. After the initial filing window, an applicant must submit evidence that frequency coordination has been performed with all licensees affected by the application. All frequency coordination must be performed in accordance with § 101.103. In the event of mutually exclusive applications occurring during the initial filing window for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands, applicants shall be given the opportunity to resolve these situations by applying for an alternative frequency pair, if one is available. To the extent that there are no other available frequencies or to the extent that mutually exclusive applications remain after this process is concluded, lotteries shall be conducted for each frequency pair among all remaining mutually exclusive applications, assuming appropriate coordination with existing broadcast auxiliary stations can be concluded, where necessary. In the event of mutually exclusive applications being received for these bands on the same day after the initial filing window has closed and a subsequent filing window opened, lotteries shall be conducted for each frequency pair among all mutually exclusive applications.

#### § § 101.51

          (a) In order to expedite action on mutually exclusive applications in services under this rules part where neither competitive bidding nor the random selection processes apply, the applicants may request the Commission to consider their applications without a formal hearing in accordance with the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (b) in this section if:

          (1) The applications are entitled to comparative consideration pursuant to § 101.45;

          (2) The applications have not been designated for formal evidentiary hearing; and

          (3) The Commission determines, initially or at any time during the procedure outline in paragraph (b) of this section, that such procedure is appropriate, and that, from the information submitted and consideration of such other matters as may be officially noticed, there are no substantial and material questions of fact, presented (Other than those relating to the comparative merits of the applications) which would preclude a grant under § 1.915 of this chapter.

          (b) Provided that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied, applicants may request the Commission to act upon their mutually exclusive applications without a formal hearing pursuant to the summary procedure outlined below:

          (1) To initiate the procedure, each applicant will submit to the Commission a written statement containing:

          (i) A waiver of the applicant's right to a formal hearing;

          (ii) A request and agreement that, in order to avoid the delay and expense of a comparative formal hearing, the Commission should exercise its judgment to select from among the mutually exclusive applications that proposal (or proposals) which would best serve the public interest; and

          (iii) The signature of a principal (and the principal's attorney if represented).

          (2) After receipt of the written requests of all of the applicants the Commission (if it deems this procedure appropriate) will issue a notice designating the comparative criteria upon which the applications are to be evaluated and will request each applicant to submit, within a specified period of time, additional information concerning the applicant's proposal relative to the comparative criteria.

          (3) Within thirty (30) days following the due date for filing this information, the Commission will accept concise and factual argument on the competing proposals from the rival applicants, potential customers, and other knowledgeable parties in interest.

          (4) Within fifteen (15) days following the due date for the filing of comments, the Commission will accept concise and factual replies from the rival applicants.

          (5) From time to time during the course of this procedure the Commission may request additional information from the applicants and hold informal conferences at which all competing applicants will have the right to be represented.

          (6) Upon evaluation of the applications, the information submitted, and such other matters as may be officially noticed the Commission will issue a decision granting one (or more) of the proposals which it concludes would best serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The decision will report briefly and concisely the reasons for the Commission's selection and will deny the other application(s). This decision will be considered final.

          (c) At its discretion, the Commission may require the submission of an affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate that the proposed assignor or transferor has not acquired an authorization or operated a station for the principal purpose of profitable sale rather than public service. This showing may include, for example, a demonstration that the proposed assignment or transfer is due to changed circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee subsequent to the acquisition of the license, or that the proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a sale of other facilities or merger of interests.

          (d) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a sale or other facilities or merger of interests, the showing specified under paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted and include an additional exhibit that:

          (1) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or merger of interests;

          (2) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interests; and

          (3) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to the facilities or business interests involved represents their fair market value at the time of the transaction.

See § 101.1331(d) for treatment of MAS incumbent site-by-site licenses recovered in EAs.

          (e) Requests for extension of time may be granted upon a showing of good cause pursuant to § 1.946(e) of this chapter.

          (f) Construction of any authorized facility or frequency must be completed by the date specified in the license as pursuant to § 1.946 of this chapter.

          (g) MVPD licensees which have both analog and digital emissions designators specified on the license and which already have, or may transition from analog to digital operations, or a combination of both, meet their completion of construction requirements and do not automatically surrender their license provided they are using either set of emissions. If the licensee has completed the transition to digital, the license can remove the unused analog emission designators the next time a modification or renewal application is filed.

#### § § 101.67

          Licenses for stations authorized under this part will be issued for a period not to exceed 10 years. Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the expiration of regular licenses shall be on the date (month and day) selected by licensees in the year of expiration.

          § 101.69   Transition of the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands from the fixed microwave services to personal communications services and emerging technologies.

#### § § 101.69

          Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands have been allocated for use by emerging technology (ET) services, including Personal Communications Services (PCS), Advanced Wireless Services (AWS), and Mobile Satellite Services (MSS). The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which ET licensees may relocate existing FMS licensees using these frequencies to other media or other fixed channels, including those in other microwave bands.

          (a) ET licensees may negotiate with FMS licensees authorized to use frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands, for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the FMS licensees would:

          (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or other media; or alternatively

          (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FMS operations.

          (b)-(c) [Reserved]

          (d) Relocation of FMS licensees in the 2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz band will be subject to mandatory negotiations only. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, mandatory negotiation periods are defined as follows:

          (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year mandatory negotiation period; and

          (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year mandatory negotiation period.

          (e) Relocation of FMS licensees by Mobile-Satellite Service (MSS) licensees will be subject to mandatory negotiations only.

          (1) The mandatory negotiation period for non-public safety incumbents will end December 8, 2004.

          (2) The mandatory negotiation period for public safety incumbents will end December 8, 2005.

          (f) AWS licensees operating in the 1910-1920 MHz and 2175-2180 MHz bands will follow the requirements and procedures set forth in ET Docket No. 00-258 and WT Docket No. 04-356.

          (g) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation period, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures. Under involuntary relocation, the incumbent is required to relocate, provided that the ET licensee meets the conditions of § 101.75.

          § 101.71   [Reserved]

#### § § 101.71

          § 101.73   Mandatory negotiations.

#### § § 101.73

          (a) A mandatory negotiation period may be initiated at the option of the ET licensee. Relocation of FMS licensees by Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) operators and AWS licensees in the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands will be subject to mandatory negotiations only.

          (b) Once mandatory negotiations have begun, an FMS licensee may not refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will consider,  the following factors:

          (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a  offer to relocate the FMS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 101.75(b);

          (2) If the FMS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is disproportionate ( whether there is a lack of proportion or relation between the two);

          (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of relocation to comparable facilities;

          (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to facilitate the relocation process.

          (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.

          (d)  A separate mandatory negotiation period will commence for each FMS licensee when an ET licensee informs that FMS licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory negotiations will be conducted with the goal of providing the FMS licensee with comparable facilities defined as facilities possessing the following characteristics:

          (1)  Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, comparable facilities provide an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, comparable facilities provide equivalent data loading bits per second (bps).

          (2)  System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the FMS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmission, it is measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog system is replaced with a digital system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.

          (3)  Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the FMS system. ET licensees would compensate FMS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, and increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. ET licensees could satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee would be equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be comparable.

          § 101.75   Involuntary relocation procedures.

#### § § 101.75

          (a) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation period, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are obligated to pay to relocated only the specific microwave links to which their systems pose an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, the FMS licensee is required to relocate, provided that the ET licensee:

          (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FMS licensee that are directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay FMS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. ET licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by FMS licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable facilities;

          (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and frequency coordination; and

          (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 2 GHz system.

          (b)  The replacement system provided to an incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent to the existing FMS system with respect to the following three factors:

          (1)  Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is required to provide the FMS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the ET licensee must provide the FMS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide FMS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the FMS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FMS system.

          (2)  System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must provide FMS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.

          (3)  Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the FMS system. ET licensees must compensate FMS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee must be equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.

          (c) The FMS licensee is not required to relocate until the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.

          (d)  If, within one year after the relocation to new facilities, the FMS licensee demonstrates that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the ET licensee must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the microwave licensee to one of the following: its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another comparable frequency band, a land-line system, or any other facility that satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section. This trial period commences on the date that the FMS licensee begins full operation of the replacement link. If the FMS licensee has retained its 2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return the license to the Commission at the end of the twelve months. FMS licensees relocated from the 2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz bands may not be returned to their former 2 GHz channels. All other remedies specified in paragraph (d) are available to FMS licensees relocated from the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands, and may be invoked whenever the FMS licensee demonstrates that its replacement facility is not comparable, subject to no time limit.

          § 101.77   Public safety licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

#### § § 101.77

          (a) In order for public safety licensees to qualify for a three year mandatory negotiation period as defined in § 101.69(d)(2), the department head responsible for system oversight must certify to the ET licensee requesting relocation that:

          (1) The agency is a Police licensee, a Fire Licensee, or an Emergency Medical Licensee as defined in § 90.7 of this chapter, or meets the eligibility requirements of § 90.20(a)(2) of this chapter, except for § 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this chapter, or that it is a licensee of other part 101 facilities licensed on a primary basis under the eligibility requirements of part 90, subpart B of this chapter; and

          (2) The majority of communications carried on the facilities at issue involve safety of life and property.

          (b) A public safety licensee must provide certification within thirty (30) days of a request from a ET licensee, or the ET licensee may presume that special treatment is inapplicable. If a public safety licensee falsely certifies to an ET licensee that it qualifies for the extended time periods, this licensee will be in violation of the Commission's rules and will subject to appropriate penalties, as well as immediately subject to the non-public safety time periods.

          § 101.79   Sunset provisions for licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

#### § § 101.79

          (a) FMS licensees will maintain primary status in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee requires use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset. Once the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA TSB 10-F (for terrestrial-to-terrestrial situations) or TIA TSB 86 (for MSS satellite-to-terrestrial situations) or any standard successor. ET licensee notification to the affected FMS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the FMS licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement which allows the FMS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis. The date that the relocation rules sunset is determined as follows:

          (1) For the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2175 MHz and 2175-2180 MHz bands, ten years after the first ET license is issued in the respective band; and

          (2) For the 2180-2200 MHz band, for MSS/ATC December 8, 2013 ( ten years after the mandatory negotiation period begins for MSS/ATC operators in the service), and for ET licensees authorized under part 27 ten years after the first part 27 license is issued in the band. To the extent that an MSS operator is also an ET licensee authorized under part 27, the part 27 sunset applies to its relocation and cost sharing obligations should the two sets of obligations conflict.

          (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:

          (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;

          (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services would be disrupted).

          § 101.81   Future licensing in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

#### § § 101.81

          After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to existing FMS systems in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to ET systems. All other modifications will render the modified FMS license secondary to ET operations, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent FMS licensee establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs of ET licensees. Incumbent FMS licensees will maintain primary status for the following technical changes:

          (a) Decreases in power;

          (b) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;

          (c) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);

          (d) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the location of an existing facility;

          (e) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;

          (f) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;

          (g) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not affect centerline height;

          (h) Minor equipment changes.

          § 101.82   Reimbursement and relocation expenses in the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

#### § § 101.82

          (a) Reimbursement and relocation expenses for the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands are addressed in §§ 27.1160-27.1174.

          (b)  Whenever an ET licensee (AWS or Mobile Satellite Service for space-to-Earth downlink in the 2130-2150 or 2180-2200 MHz bands) relocates an incumbent paired microwave link with one path in the 2130-2150 MHz band and the paired path in the 2180-2200 MHz band, the relocator is entitled to reimbursement of 50 percent of its relocation costs (see paragraph (e)) of this section from any other AWS licensee or MSS space-to-Earth downlink operator which would have been required to relocate the same fixed microwave link as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

          (c)  For an MSS space-to-Earth downlink, the cost-sharing obligation is based on the interference criteria for relocation, , TIA TSB 86 or any standard successor, relative to the relocated microwave link. Subsequently entering MSS space-to-Earth downlink operators must reimburse AWS or MSS space-to-Earth relocators (see paragraph (e)) of this section before the later entrant may begin operations in these bands, unless the later entrant can demonstrate that it would not have interfered with the microwave link in question.

          (d)  For terrestrial stations (AWS), cost-sharing obligations are governed by §§ 27.1160 through 27.1174 of this chapter; provided, however, that MSS operators are not obligated to reimburse voluntarily relocating FMS incumbents in the 2180-2200 MHz band. (AWS reimbursement and cost-sharing obligations relative to voluntarily relocating FMS incumbents are governed by § 27.1166 of this chapter).

          (e) The total costs of which 50 percent is to be reimbursed will not exceed $250,000 per paired fixed microwave link relocated, with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is required.

          § 101.85   Transition of the 18.3-19.3 GHz band from the terrestrial fixed services to the fixed-satellite service (FSS).

#### § § 101.85

          Fixed services (FS) frequencies in the 18.3-19.3 GHz bands listed in §§ 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 78.18(a)(4) and § 101.147(a) and (r) of this chapter have been allocated for use by the fixed-satellite service (FSS). The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which FSS licensees may relocate existing FS licensees using these frequencies to other frequency bands, media or facilities.

          (a) FSS licensees may negotiate with FS licensees authorized to use frequencies in the 18.3-19.30 GHz bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the FS licensees would:

          (1) Relocate their operations to other frequency bands, media or facilities; or alternatively

          (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the FSS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FSS operations.

          (b)(1) FS operations in the 18.3-18.58 GHz band that remain co-primary under the provisions of §§ 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(d), 78.18(a)(4) and 101.147(r) of this chapter will continue to be co-primary with the FSS users of this spectrum until November 19, 2012 or until the relocation of the fixed service operations, whichever occurs sooner.

          (2) FS operations in the 18.58-19.3 GHz band that remain co-primary under the provisions of §§ 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(d), 78.18(a)(4) and 101.147(r) of this chapter will continue to be co-primary with the FSS users of this spectrum until June 8, 2010 or until the relocation of the fixed service operations, whichever occurs sooner, except for operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz and low power systems operating pursuant to § 101.47(r)(10), which shall operate on a co-primary basis until October 31, 2011.

          (3) If no agreement is reached during the negotiations pursuant to § 101.85(a), an FSS licensee may initiate relocation procedures. Under the relocation procedures, the incumbent is required to relocate, provided that the FSS licensee meets the conditions of § 101.91.

          (c) Negotiation periods are defined as follows:

          (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year negotiation period.

          (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year negotiation period.

          § 101.89   Negotiations.

#### § § 101.89

          (a) The negotiation is triggered by the fixed-satellite service (FSS) licensee, who must contact the fixed services (FS) licensee and request that negotiations begin.

          (b) Once negotiations have begun, an FS licensee may not refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:

          (1) Whether the FSS licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate the FS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with § 101.91(b);

          (2) If the FS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or relation between the two);

          (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of relocation to comparable facilities;

          (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to facilitate the relocation process.

          (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.

          (d) Negotiations will commence when the FSS licensee informs the FS licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Negotiations will be conducted with the goal of providing the FS licensee with comparable facilities, defined as facilities possessing the following characteristics:

          (1)  Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FS system.

          (2)  System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.

          (3)  Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FS licensee must be equivalent to the 18 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.

          § 101.91   Involuntary relocation procedures.

#### § § 101.91

          (a) If no agreement is reached during the negotiations period, an FSS licensee may initiate relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. FSS licensees are obligated to pay to relocate only the specific microwave links from which their systems may receive interference. Under these procedures, the FS licensee is required to relocate, provided that the FSS licensee:

          (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FS licensee that are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. FSS licensees are not required to pay FS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. FSS licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by FS licensees during the negotiations once the negotiation is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable facilities;

          (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and frequency coordination; and

          (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 18 GHz system.

          (b)  The replacement system provided to an incumbent during a relocation must be at least equivalent to the existing FS system with respect to the following three factors:

          (1)  Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FS system.

          (2)  System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.

          (3)  Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FS licensee must be equivalent to the 18 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.

          (c) The FS licensee is not required to relocate until the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff. The FS licensee may take up to 12 months to make such adjustments and perform such testing.

          (d) If the FS licensee demonstrates to the Commission that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the Commission may require the FSS licensee to further modify or replace the FS licensee's equipment.

          § 101.95   Sunset provisions for licensees in the 18.30-19.30 GHz band.

#### § § 101.95

          (a) FSS licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset (see §§ 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 78.18(a)(4) of this chapter, and 101.147 (a) and (r)). Once the relocation rules sunset, an FSS licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that the FSS licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA Bulletin 10-F or any standard successor. FSS licensee notification to the affected FS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the FS licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement which allows the FS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis.

          (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:

          (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available); and

          (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services would be disrupted).

          § 101.97   Future licensing in the 18.30-19.30 GHz band.

#### § § 101.97

          (a) All major modifications and extensions to existing FS systems in the 18.3-18.58 band after November 19, 2002, or in the 18.58-19.30 band after June 8, 2000 (with the exception of certain low power operations authorized under § 101.147(r)(10)) will be authorized on a secondary basis to FSS systems. All other modifications will render the modified FS license secondary to FSS operations, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent FS licensee establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs for FSS licensees. Incumbent FS licensees will maintain primary status for the following technical changes:

          (1) Decreases in power;

          (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;

          (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);

          (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the location of an existing facility;

          (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;

          (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;

          (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not affect centerline height;

          (8) Minor equipment changes.

          (9) Changes in ownership or control.

          (b) The provisions of § 101.83 are applicable, notwithstanding any other provisions of this section.

        § 101.103   Frequency coordination procedures.

#### § § 101.103

        (a) Assignment of frequencies will be made only in such a manner as to facilitate the rendition of communication service on an interference-free basis in each service area. Unless otherwise indicated, each frequency available for use by stations in these services will be assigned exclusively to a single applicant in any service area. All applicants for, and licensees of, stations in these services must cooperate in the selection and use of the frequencies assigned in order to minimize interference and thereby obtain the most effective use of the authorized facilities. In the event harmful interference occurs or appears likely to occur between two or more radio systems and such interference cannot be resolved between the licensees thereof, the Commission may specify a time sharing arrangement for the stations involved or may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the licensees to make such changes in operating techniques or equipment as it may deem necessary to avoid such interference.

        (b)(1) Operations in the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 MHz licensed prior to March 11, 1997, were licensed on an unprotected basis and are subject to harmful interference from similarly licensed operations in that band.

        (i) Operations licensed in the Local Mulitpoint Distribution Service and those operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, except in the Local Television Transmission Service, operating in these bands are equally protected against harmful interference from each other.

        (ii) In the case of operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, except in the Local Television Transmission Service, that are licensed on a point-to-radius basis, LMDS licensees shall be subject to the protection requirement established in this section in the case of existing links operated by such licensees, and in the case of links added by such licensees in the future in accordance with the terms of their point-to-radius licenses.

        (iii) An LMDS licensee may not initiate operations within the point-to-radius area licensed to an operator (other than an operator in the Local Television Transmission Service) prior to March 11, 1997, even if such operator has not initiated operations to the fullest extent of the license. An LMDS licensee, however, may initiate operations at the border of such operator's license area without prior coordination if the LMDS licensee's operations would not cause harmful interference to the other operator's existing operations.

        (iv) An operator (other than an operator in the Local Television Transmission Service) licensed on a point-to-radius basis prior to March 11, 1997, may add additional stations within its license area. Such operator shall coordinate with any affected LMDS licensee if its new operations might cause harmful interference to the existing operations of such LMDS licensee.

        (v) Operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, on a point-to-point basis may not be extended or otherwise modified through the addition of point-to-point links. Such operations shall be limited to the use of frequency pairs licensed as of March 11, 1997. Operations licensed in the Local Television Transmission Service as of March 11, 1997, may continue to operate, but such operators may not expand existing operations nor initiate new operations.

        (2) Operations in the 31,075-31,225 MHz band licensed prior to March 11, 1997, shall receive no protection against harmful interference from authorized operations in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service in that band.

        (3) Non-LMDS operations in the entire 31,000-31,300 MHz band licensed after March 11, 1997, based on applications refiled no later than June 26, 1998 are unprotected with respect to each other and subject to harmful interference from each other.

        (i) Such operations and any operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, in the band are unprotected with respect to each other and subject to harmful interference from each other.

        (ii) Such operations are licensed on a secondary basis to LMDS operations licensed in the band, may not cause interference to LMDS operations, and are not protected from interference from LMDS operations.

        (iii) Such operations licensed on a point-to-point basis may not be extended or otherwise modified through the addition of point-to-point links. Such operations licensed on a point-to-radius basis may add additional stations within the licensed area.

        (c) Frequency diversity transmission will not be authorized in these services in the absence of a factual showing that the required communications cannot practically be achieved by other means. Where frequency diversity is deemed to be justified on a protection channel basis, it will be limited to one protection channel for the bands 3,700-4,200, 5925-6425, and 6525-6875 MHz, and a ratio of one protection channel for three working channels for the bands 10,550-10,680 and 10,700-11,700 MHz. In the bands 3,700-4,200, 5,925-6,425, and 6525-6875 MHz, no frequency diversity protection channel will be authorized unless there is a minimum of three working channels, except that where a substantial showing is made that a total of three working channels will be required within three years, a protection channel may be authorized simultaneously with the first working channel. A protection channel authorized under such exception will be subject to termination if applications for the third working channel are not filed within three years of the grant date of the applications for the first working channel. Where equipment employing digital modulation techniques with cross-polarized operation on the same frequency is used, the protection channel authorized under the above conditions may be considered to consist of both polarizations of the protection frequency where such is shown to be necessary.

        (d)  For each frequency authorized under this part, the following frequency usage coordination procedures will apply:

        (1)  Proposed frequency usage must be prior coordinated with existing licensees, permittees and applicants in the area, and other applicants with previously filed applications, whose facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference on active channels, applied-for channels, or channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must be completed prior to filing an application for regular authorization, or a major amendment to a pending application, or any major modification to a license. In coordinating frequency usage with stations in the fixed satellite service, applicants must also comply with the requirements of § 101.21(f). In engineering a system or modification thereto, the applicant must, by appropriate studies and analyses, select sites, transmitters, antennas and frequencies that will avoid interference in excess of permissible levels to other users. All applicants and licensees must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the party being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer a proposal in cases involving conflicts. Applicants should make every reasonable effort to avoid blocking the growth of systems as prior coordinated. The applicant must identify in the application all entities with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical problems are not resolved, an explanation must be submitted with the application. Where technical problems are resolved by an agreement or operating arrangement between the parties that would require special procedures be taken to reduce the likelihood of interference in excess of permissible levels (such as the use of artificial site shielding) or would result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof may be contained in the application.

        (2) Coordination procedure guidelines are as follows:

        (i) Coordination involves two separate elements: notification and response. Both or either may be oral or in written form. To be acceptable for filing, all applications and major technical amendments must certify that coordination, including response, has been completed. The names of the licensees, permittees and applicants with which coordination was accomplished must be specified. If such notice and/or response is oral, the party providing such notice or response must supply written documentation of the communication upon request;

        (ii) Notification must include relevant technical details of the proposal. At minimum, this should include, as applicable, the following:

        Applicant's name and address.

        Transmitting station name.

        Transmitting station coordinates.

        Frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted.

        Transmitting equipment type, its stability, actual output power, emission designator, and type of modulation(s) (loading). Notification shall indicate if modulations lower than the values listed in the table to § 101.141(a)(3) of the Commission's rules will be used.

        Transmitting antenna type(s), model, gain and, if required, a radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.

        Transmitting antenna center line height(s) above ground level and ground elevation above mean sea level.

        Receiving station name.

        Receiving station coordinates.

        Receiving antenna type(s), model, gain, and, if required, a radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.

        Receiving antenna center line height(s) above ground level and ground elevation above mean sea level.

        Path azimuth and distance.

        Estimated transmitter transmission line loss expressed in dB.

        Estimated receiver transmission line loss expressed in dB.

        For a system utilizing ATPC, maximum transmit power, coordinated transmit power, and nominal transmit power.

        (iii) For transmitters employing digital modulation techniques, the notification should clearly identify the type of modulation. Upon request, additional details of the operating characteristics of the equipment must also be furnished;

        (iv) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to notification indicating potential interference must specify the technical details and must be provided to the applicant, in writing, within the 30-day notification period. Every reasonable effort should be made by all applicants, permittees and licensees to eliminate all problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received within 30 days, the applicant will be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to coordinate and may file its application without a response;

        (v) The 30-day notification period is calculated from the date of receipt by the applicant, permittee, or licensee being notified. If notification is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:

        (A) The return receipt on certified mail;

        (B) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the recipient; or

        (C) A conservative estimate of the time required for the mail to reach its destination. In the last case, the estimated date when the 30-day period would expire should be stated in the notification.

        (vi) An expedited prior coordination period (less than 30 days) may be requested when deemed necessary by a notifying party. The coordination notice should be identified as “expedited” and the requested response date should be clearly indicated. However, circumstances preventing a timely response from the receiving party should be accommodated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the notifying party to receive written concurrence (or verbal, with written to follow) from affected parties or their coordination representatives.

        (vii) All technical problems that come to light during coordination must be resolved unless a statement is included with the application to the effect that the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the conflict and briefly the reason therefor;

        (viii) Where a number of technical changes become necessary for a system during the course of coordination, an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate notifications for these changes. Where the changes are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be identified. When changes are not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed notification should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. When the notifying party believes a shorter response time is reasonable and appropriate, it may be helpful for that party to so indicate in the notice and perhaps suggest a response date;

        (ix) If, after coordination is successfully completed, it is determined that a subsequent change could have no impact on some parties receiving the original notification, these parties must be notified of the change and of the coordinator's opinion that no response is required;

        (x) Applicants, permittees and licensees should supply to all other applicants, permittees and licensees within their areas of operations, the name, address and telephone number of their coordination representatives. Upon request from coordinating applicants, permittees and licensees, data and information concerning existing or proposed facilities and future growth plans in the area of interest should be furnished unless such request is unreasonable or would impose a significant burden in compilation;

        (xi) Parties should keep other parties with whom they are coordinating advised of changes in plans for facilities previously coordinated. If applications have not been filed 6 months after coordination was initiated, parties may assume that such frequency use is no longer desired unless a second notification has been received within 10 days of the end of the 6 month period. Renewal notifications are to be sent to all originally notified parties, even if coordination has not been successfully completed with those parties; and

        (xii) Any frequency reserved by a licensee for future use in the bands subject to this part must be released for use by another licensee, permittee or applicant upon a showing by the latter that it requires an additional frequency and cannot coordinate one that is not reserved for future use.

        (e) Where frequency conflicts arise between co-pending applications in the Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave, Common Carrier Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave and Local Television Transmission Services, it is the obligation of the later filing applicant to amend his application to remove the conflict, unless it can make a showing that the conflict cannot be reasonably eliminated. Where a frequency conflict is not resolved and no showing is submitted as to why the conflict cannot be resolved, the Commission may grant the first filed application and dismiss the later filed application(s) after giving the later filing applicant(s) 30 days to respond to the proposed action.

        (f)(1)  Prior to the construction or addition of an MVDDS transmitting antenna in this frequency band, the MVDDS licensee shall provide notice of intent to construct the proposed antenna site to NGSO FSS licensees operating in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band and maintain an Internet web site of all existing transmitting sites and transmitting antennas that are scheduled for operation within one year including the “in service” dates. In addition to the location of a proposed new transmitting antenna, MVDDS licensees shall provide to the NGSO FSS licensees a technical description of the operating characteristics of the proposed transmission facility. At a minimum, the following information must be included in each notification:

        (i) Name of MVDDS licensee;

        (ii) Geographic location (including NAD83 coordinates) of proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna;

        (iii) Maximum EIRP per 24 MHz;

        (iv) Height above average terrain of the transmitting antenna;

        (v) Type of antenna to be utilized;

        (vi) Main beam azimuth and altitude orientation for the proposed transmitting antenna;

        (vii) Theoretically modeled antenna radiation pattern;

        (viii) Type(s) of emissions, and;

        (ix) Description of the proposed service area.

        (2) If the proposed MVDDS antenna site does not meet the minimum spacing requirements on the date of original notification or on subsequent annual anniversary dates of non-operation as set forth in § 101.129, then the MVDDS licensee shall not construct the proposed transmission facility unless all NGSO FSS licensees having active subscribers within the minimum separation distance agree to a shorter spacing. Nothing in this section shall preclude MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees from agreeing to accept the siting of new MVDDS transmitting antennas that do no meet the minimum distance set forth in § 101.129. Incumbent point-to-point licensees' (those not licensed as MVDDS) facilities are to be operated in the band 12,200-12,700 MHz following the procedures, technical standards, and requirements of § 101.105 in order to protect stations providing Direct Broadcast Satellite Service.

        (g)  (1) When the transmitting facilities in a Basic Trading Area (BTA) are to be operated in the bands 29,100-29,250 MHz and 31,000-31,300 MHz and the facilities are located within 20 kilometers of the boundaries of a BTA, each licensee must complete the frequency coordination process of paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to neighboring BTA licensees that may be affected by its operations prior to initiating service. In addition, all licensed transmitting facilities operating in the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 MHz and located within 20 kilometers of neighboring facilities must complete the frequency coordination process of paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to such authorized operations before initiating service.

        (2) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to notification indicating potential interference must specify the technical details and must be provided to the applicant, either electronically or in writing, within the 30-day notification period. Every reasonable effort should be made by all licensees to eliminate all problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received within 30 days, the licensee will be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to coordinate and commence operation without a response. The beginning of the 30-day period is determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section.

        (h)  (1)(i) Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) receive stations operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band within a radius of 75 nautical miles of the geographic coordinates provided by a non-GSO-MSS licensee pursuant to § 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) (the “feeder link earth station complex protection zone”) shall accept any interference caused to them by such earth station complexes and shall not claim protection from such earth station complexes.

        (ii) LMDS licensees operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band outside a feeder link earth station complex protection zone shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems with the non-GSO MSS licensee to the extent that transmissions from the non-GSO MSS operator's feeder link earth station complex interfere with an LMDS receive station.

        (2) No more than 15 days after the release of a public notice announcing the commencement of LMDS auctions, feeder link earth station complexes to be licensed pursuant to § 25.257 of this chapter shall be specified by a set of geographic coordinates in accordance with the following requirements: no feeder link earth station complex may be located in the top eight (8) metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), ranked by population, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget as of June 1993, using estimated populations as of December 1992; two (2) complexes may be located in MSAs 9 through 25, one of which must be Phoenix, AZ (for a complex at Chandler, AZ); two (2) complexes may be located in MSAs 26 to 50; three (3) complexes may be located in MSAs 51 to 100, one of which must be Honolulu, Hawaii (for a complex at Waimea); and the three (3) remaining complexes must be located at least 75 nautical miles from the borders of the 100 largest MSAs or in any MSA not included in the 100 largest MSAs. Any location allotted for one range of MSAs may be taken from an MSA below that range.

        (3)(i) Any non-GSO MSS licensee may at any time specify sets of geographic coordinates for feeder link earth station complexes with each earth station contained therein to be located at least 75 nautical miles from the border of the 100 largest MSAs.

        (ii) For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, non-GSO MSS feeder link earth station complexes shall be entitled to accommodation only if the affected non-GSO MSS licensee preapplies to the Commission for a feeder link earth station complex or certifies to the Commission within sixty days of receiving a copy of an LMDS application that it intends to file an application for a feeder link earth station complex within six months of the date of receipt of the LMDS application.

        (iii) If said non-GSO MSS licensee application is filed later than six months after certification of the Commission, the LMDS and non-GSO MSS entities shall still cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems, but the LMDS licensee shall not be obligated to re-engineer its proposal or make changes to its system.

        (4) LMDS licensees or applicants proposing to operate hub stations on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band at locations outside of the 100 largest MSAs or within a distance of 150 nautical miles from a set of geographic coordinates specified under paragraphs (h)(2) or (h)(3)(i) of this section shall serve copies of their applications on all non-GSO MSS applicants, permittees or licensees meeting the criteria specified in § 25.257(a). Non-GSO MSS licensees or applicants shall serve copies of their feeder link earth station applications, after the LMDS auction, on any LMDS applicant or licensee within a distance of 150 nautical miles from the geographic coordinates that it specified under § 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i). Any necessary coordination shall commence upon notification by the party receiving an application to the party who filed the application. The results of any such coordination shall be reported to the Commission within sixty days. The non-GSO MSS earth station licensee shall also provide all such LMDS licensees with a copy of its channel plan.

        § 101.105   Interference protection criteria.

#### § § 101.105

        (a) The interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part are as follows:

        (1) To long-haul analog systems, employing frequency modulated radio and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, the allowable interference level per exposure:

        (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not exceed 5 pwpO (Picowatts of absolute noise power psophometrically weighted (pwpO), appearing in an equivalent voice band channel of 300-3400 Hz); or

        (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 pwpO.

        (2) To short-haul analog systems employing frequency modulated radio and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, the allowable interference level per exposure:

        (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not exceed 25 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 250 pwpO per exposure; or

        (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 1000 pwpO per exposure.

        (3) FM-TV. In analog systems employing frequency modulated radio that is modulated by a standard, television (visual) signal, the allowable interference level per exposure may not exceed the levels which would apply to long-haul or short-haul FM-FDM systems, as outlined in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, having a 600-1200 voice channel capacity.

        (4) 12.2-12.7 GHz band. (i) To accommodate co-primary NGSO FSS earth stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, the PFD of an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed −135 dBW/m  in any 4 kHz band at a reference point at the surface of the earth at a distance greater than 3 kilometers from the MVDDS transmitting antenna.

        (ii) To accommodate co-primary Direct Broadcast Satellite Service earth stations, an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed the EPFD levels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section at any DBS subscriber location in accordance with the procedures listed in § 101.1440 of this part.

        (A) Definition of equivalent power flux density: The equivalent power flux density (EPFD) is the power flux density produced at a direct broadcast service (DBS) receive earth station, taking into account shielding effects and the off-axis discrimination of the receiving antenna assumed to be pointing at the appropriate DBS satellite(s) from the transmitting antenna of a multichannel video distribution and data service (MVDDS) transmit station. The EPFD in dBW/m  in the reference bandwidth is calculated using the following formula:

        (B) Regional equivalent power flux density levels:

        () −_1_68.4 dBW/m /4kHz in the Eastern region consisting of the District of Columbia and the following states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida;

        () −169.8 dBW/m /4kHz in the Midwestern region consisting of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas;

        () −171.0 dBW/m /4kHz in the Southwestern region consisting of the following states: Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California (south of _3_7° North Latitude);

        () −172.1 dBW/m /_4_kHz in the Northwestern region consisting of the following states: Washington, Oregon, California (north of 37° North Latitude), Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii.

        (iii) Except for public safety entities, harmful interference protection from MVDDS stations to incumbent point-to-point 12 GHz fixed stations is not required. Incumbent point-to-point private operational fixed 12 GHz stations, except for public safety entities, are required to protect MVDDS stations under the process described in § 101.103(d) of this part.

        (5)  In these bands the following interference criteria shall apply:

        (i) For receivers employing digital modulation: based upon manufacturer data and following TSB 10-F or other generally acceptable good engineering practice, for each potential case of interference a threshold-to-interference ratio (T/I) shall be determined that would cause 1.0 dB of degradation to the static threshold of the protected receiver. For the range of carrier power levels (C) between the clear-air (unfaded) value and the fully-faded static threshold value, in no case shall interference cause C/I to be less than the T/I so determined unless it can be shown that the availability of the affected receiver would still be acceptable despite the interference.

        (ii) For receivers employing analog modulation: manufacturer data or industry criteria will specify a baseband signal-to-noise requirement (S/N) of the receiver that will result in acceptable signal quality for continuous operation. Following TSB 10-F or other generally acceptable good engineering practice, for each potential case of interference a C/I objective shall be calculated to ensure that this S/N will not be degraded by more than 1.0 dB. For the range of carrier power levels (C) between the clear-air (unfaded) value and the fully-faded threshold value, in no case shall interference cause the C/I to be less than the objective so determined unless it can be shown that the signal quality and availability of the affected receiver would still be acceptable despite the interference.

        (6)  In these bands prior links shall be protected to a threshold-to-interference ratio (T/I) level of 1.0 dB of degradation to the static threshold of the protected receiver. Any new link shall not decrease a previous link's desired-to-undesired (D/U) signal ratio below a minimum of 36 dB, unless the earlier link's licensee agrees to accept a lower D/U.

        (7) All stations operating under this part must protect the radio quiet zones as required by § 1.924 of this chapter. Stations authorized by competitive bidding are cautioned that they must receive the appropriate approvals directly from the relevant quiet zone entity prior to operating.

        (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section the adjacent channel interference protection criteria to be afforded, regardless of system length, or type of modulation, multiplexing, or frequency band, must be such that the interfering signal does not produce more than 1.0 dB degradation of the practical threshold of the protected receiver. The “practical threshold” of the protected receiver can be based upon the definition in TSB 10, referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, or upon alternative generally acceptable good engineering standards.

        (c)  (1) Guidelines for applying the interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part are specified in the Telecommunications Industry Association's Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, “Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems” (TSB 10). Other procedures that follow generally acceptable good engineering practices are also acceptable to the Commission.

        (2) If TSB 10 guidelines cannot be used, the following interference protection criteria may be used by calculating the ratio in dB between the desired (carrier signal) and the undesired (interfering) signal (C/I ratio) appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation (victim receiver). Except as provided in § 101.147 where the applicant's proposed facilities are of a type not included in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section or where the development of the carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio is not covered by generally acceptable procedures, or where the applicant does not wish to develop the carrier-to-interference ratio, the applicant must, in the absence of criteria or a developed C/I ratio, employ the following C/I protection ratios:

        (i)  Both side band and carrier-beat, applicable to all bands; the existing or previously authorized system must be afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at least 90 dB, except in the 952-960 MHz band where it must be 75dB, and in the 71,000-76,000 MHz and 81,000-86,000 MHz bands where the criteria in paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, and in the 92,000-94,000 MHz and 94,100-95,000 MHz bands, where the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of this section applies; or

        (ii)  Applicable to all bands; the existing or previously authorized system must be afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at least 56 dB, except in the 71,000-76,000 MHz and 81,000-86,000 MHz bands where the criteria in paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, and in the 92,000-94,000 MHz and 94,100-95,000 MHz bands, where the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of this section applies.

        (3) Applicants for frequencies listed in § 101.147(b)(1) through (4) must make the following showings that protection criteria have been met over the entire service area of existing systems. Such showings may be made by the applicant or may be satisfied by a statement from a frequency coordinator.

        (i) For site-based multiple address stations in the 928-929/952-960 MHz and the 932-932.5/941-941.5 MHz bands, a statement that the proposed system complies with the following co-channel separations from all existing stations and pending applications:

        (ii) In cases where the geographic separation standard in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section is not followed, an engineering analysis must be submitted to show the coordination of the proposed assignment with existing systems located closer than those standards. The engineering analyses will include:

        (A) Specification of the interference criteria and system parameters used in the interference study;

        (B) Nominal service areas of each system included in the interference analysis;

        (C) Modified service areas resulting from the proposed system. The propagation models used to establish the service boundary limits must be specified and any special terrain features considered in computing the interference impact should be described; and

        (D) A statement that all parties affected have agreed to the engineering analysis and will accept the calculated levels of interference.

        (iii) MAS EA licensees shall provide protection in accordance with § 101.1333.

        (4) Multiple address systems operating on subfrequencies in accordance with § 101.147 that propose to operate master stations at unspecified locations must define the operating area by a radius about a geographical coordinate and describe how interference to co-channel users will be controlled.

        (5) Multiple address frequencies in the 956.25-956.45 MHz bands may be assigned for use by mobile master stations on a primary basis. Multiple address frequencies in the 941.0-941.5 MHz bands that are licensed on a site-by-site basis and the 952 MHz bands may be assigned for use by primary mobile master stations on a case-by-case basis if the 956.25-956.45 MHz frequencies are unavailable. Multiple address mobile (master and remote) operation is permitted on frequencies licensed by geographic area subject to the interference protection criteria set forth in § 101.1333,  adjacent channel site-based licensees and co-channel operations in adjacent EAs. Mobile operation in the 959.85-960 MHz band is not permitted.

        (6) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels numbered 4A, 4B, 7, 9, and 19/20 in the 10.6 GHz band must demonstrate that all existing co-channel stations are at least 56 kilometers from the proposed nodal station site. Applicants for these channels must certify that all licensees and applicants for stations on the adjacent channels within 56 kilometers of the proposed nodal station have been notified of the proposed station and do not object. Alternatively, or if one of the affected adjacent channel interests does object, the applicant may show that all affected adjacent channel parties are provided a C/I protection ratio of 0 dB. An applicant proposing to operate at an AAT greater than 91 meters must reduce its EIRP in accordance with the following table; however, in no case may EIRP exceed 70 dBm on the 10.6 GHz channels:

        (7) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels numbered 21, 22, 23, and 24 in the 10.6 GHz band must include an analysis of the potential for harmful interference to all other licensed and previously applied for co-channel and adjacent channel stations located within 80 kilometers of the location of the proposed station. The criteria contained in § 101.103(d)(2) must be used in this analysis. Applicants must certify that copies of this analysis have been served on all parties which might reasonably be expected to receive interference above the levels set out in § 101.103(d)(2) within 5 days of the date the subject application is filed with the Commission.

        (8) If the potential interference will exceed the prescribed limits, a statement shall be submitted with the application for new or modified stations to the effect that all parties have agreed to accept the higher level of interference.

        (d) Effective August 1, 1985, when a fixed station that conforms to the technical standards of this subpart (or, in the case of the 12,200-12,700 MHz band, for an incumbent non-MVDDS station or a direct broadcast satellite station) receives or will receive interference in excess of the levels specified in this section as a result of an existing licensee's use of non-conforming equipment authorized between July 20, 1961 and July 1, 1976, and the interference would not result if the interfering station's equipment complied with the current technical standards, the licensee of the non-conforming station must take whatever steps are necessary to correct the situation up to the point of installing equipment which fully conforms to the technical standards of this subpart. In such cases, if the engineering analysis demonstrates that:

        (1) The conforming station would receive interference from a non-conforming station in excess of the levels specified in this section; and

        (2) The interference would be eliminated if the non-conforming equipment were replaced with equipment which complies with the standards of this subpart, the licensee (or prospective licensee) of the station which would receive interference must provide written notice of the potential interference to both the non-conforming licensee and the Commission's office in Gettysburg, PA. The non-conforming licensee must make all required equipment changes within 180 days from the date of official Commission notice informing the licensee that it must upgrade its equipment, unless an alternative solution has been agreed to by all parties involved in the interference situation. If a non-conforming licensee fails to make all required changes within the specified period of time, the Commission may require the licensee to suspend operation until the changes are completed.

        (e)  Should a licensee licensed under this part receive harmful interference from another licensee licensed under this chapter, the parties involved shall comply with the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein:

        (1) The licensee experiencing the harmful interference shall notify the licensee believed to be causing the harmful interference and shall supply information describing its problem and supporting its claim;

        (2) Upon receipt of the harmful interference notice, the licensee alleged to be causing the harmful interference shall respond immediately and make every reasonable effort to identify and resolve the conflict; and

        (3) Licensees are encouraged to resolve the harmful interference prior to contacting the Commission.

        § 101.107   Frequency tolerance.

#### § § 101.107

        (a) The carrier frequency of each transmitter authorized in these services must be maintained within the following percentage of the reference frequency except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section or in the applicable subpart of this part (unless otherwise specified in the instrument of station authorization the reference frequency will be deemed to be the assigned frequency):

        (b) Heterodyne microwave radio systems may be authorized at a somewhat less restrictive frequency tolerance (up to .01 percent) to compensate for frequency shift caused by numerous repeaters between base band signal insertion. Where such relaxation is sought, applicant must provide all calculations and indicate the desired tolerance over each path. In such instances the radio transmitters and receivers used must individually be capable of complying with the tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Heterodyne operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or greater.

        (c) As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that specified in § 101.111.

        § 101.109   Bandwidth.

#### § § 101.109

        (a) Each authorization issued pursuant to these rules will show, as the emission designator, a symbol representing the class of emission which must be prefixed by a number specifying the necessary bandwidth. This figure does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth actually occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where part 2 of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of the necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth may be used in the emission designator.

        (b) Stations in this service will be authorized any type of emission, method of modulation, and transmission characteristic, consistent with efficient use of the spectrum and good engineering practice, except that Type B, damped-wave emission will not be authorized.

        (c) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency assigned is set out in the table that follows. Regardless of the maximum authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the Commission reserves the right to issue a license for less than the maximum bandwidth if it appears that a lesser bandwidth would be sufficient to support an applicant's intended communications.

        § 101.111   Emission limitations.

#### § § 101.111

        (a) The mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter in accordance with the following schedule:

        (1) When using transmissions other than those employing digital modulation techniques:

        (i) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 25 decibels;

        (ii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 decibels;

        (iii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + *10* Log (mean output power in watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

        (2) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques (see § 101.141(b)) in situations not covered in this section:

        (i) For operating frequencies below 15 GHz, in any 4 KHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less than 50 decibels:

        (ii) For operating frequencies above 15 GHz, in any 1 MHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less than 11 decibels:

        (iii) In any 1 MHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + *10* Log (the mean output power in watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. The authorized bandwidth includes the nominal radio frequency bandwidth of an individual transmitter/modulator in block-assigned bands. Equipment licensed prior to April 1, 2005 shall only be required to meet this standard in any 4 kHz band.

        (iv) The emission mask for LMDS and the 24 GHz Service shall use the equation in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and apply it only to the band edge of each block of spectrum, but not to subchannels established by licensees. The value of P in the equation is the percentage removed from the carrier frequency and assumes that the carrier frequency is the center of the actual bandwidth used. The emission mask can be satisfied by locating a carrier of the subchannel sufficiently far from the channel edges so that the emission levels of the mask are satisfied. The LMDS or 24 GHz emission mask shall use a value B (bandwidth) of 40 MHz, for all cases even in the case where a narrower subchannel is used (for instance the actual bandwidth is 10 MHz) and the mean output power used in the calculation is the sum of the output power of a fully populated channel. For block assigned channels, the out-of-band emission limits apply only outside the assigned band of operation and not within the band.

        (v) The emission mask for the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and 94.1-95 GHz bands used in the equation in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies only to the edge of each channel, but not to sub-channels established by licensees. The value of P in the equation is for the percentage removed from the carrier frequency and assumes that the carrier frequency is the center of the actual bandwidth used. The value of B will always be 500 MHz. In the case where a narrower sub-channel is used within the assigned bandwidth, such sub-carrier will be located sufficiently far from the channel edges to satisfy the emission levels of the mask. The mean output power used in the calculation is the sum of the output power of a fully populated channel.

        (vi)(A) In order to protect Federal Earth Exploration-Satellite Service (passive), aeronautical and maritime endpoints in motion operating in the 70 and 80 GHz bands must comply with the following limits:

        () Ground-to-air transmissions shall not exceed an unwanted emission level of -38.5 dBW per _1_00 MHz in any portion of the 86-92 GHz passive band;

        () Air-to-air, ship-to-shore, and aerostat-to-shore transmissions shall not exceed an unwanted emission level of −_2_9.7 dBW per 100 MHz in any portion of the 86-92 GHz passive band.

        (B) Any changes to system specifications, operations, or deployment scenarios for aeronautical or maritime end points in motion shall be pre-coordinated with NTIA and affected Federal agencies, and licensees of aeronautical or maritime end points in motion must cooperate fully with any updates to the required unwanted emission limits that may result from these modifications.

        (3) For Digital Termination System channels used in the Digital Electronic Message Service (DEMS) operating in the 10,550-10,680 MHz band:

        (i) In any 4 KHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the edge of the DEMS channel by up to and including 1.125 times the DEMS subchannel bandwidth: As specified by the following equation may in no event be less than 50 + *10* log N decibels:

        (ii) In any 4 KHz band within the authorized DEMS band the center frequency of which is removed from the center frequency of the DEMS channel by more than the sum of 50% of the DEMS channel bandwidth plus 1.125 times the subchannel bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less than 80 decibels:

        (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the authorized DEMS band: At least 43 + *10* log (mean output power in watts) decibels.

        (4) For DEMS channels in the 17,700-19,700 MHz band:

        (i) In any 4 KHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the frequency of the center of the DEMS channel by more than 50 percent of the DEMS channel bandwidth up to and including 50 percent plus 500 KHz: As specified by the following equation but in no event be less than 50 + *10* log N decibels:

        (ii) In any 4 KHz band within the authorized DEMS band, the center frequency of which is removed from the center frequency of the DEMS channel by more than the sum of 50 percent of the channel bandwidth plus 500 KHz: As specified by the following equation but in no event less than 80 decibels:

        (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the authorized Digital Message Service band: At least 43 + *10* log (mean output power in watts) decibels.

        (5) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques on the 900 MHz multiple address frequencies with a 12.5 KHz bandwidth, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier power of the transmitter (P) in accordance with the following schedule:

        (i) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fd in KHz) of more than 2.5 KHz up to and including 6.25 KHz: At least 53 log (fd/2.5) decibels;

        (ii) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fd in KHz) of more than 6.25 KHz up to and including 9.5 KHz: At least *10*3 log (fd/3.9) decibels;

        (iii) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fd in KHz) of more than 9.5 KHz up to and including 15 KHz: At least 157 log (fd/5.3) decibels; and

        (iv) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency greater than 15 KHz: At least 50 plus *10* log(P) or 70 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

        (6) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques on the 900 MHz multiple address frequencies with a bandwidth greater than 12.5 KHz, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier power of the transmitter (P) in accordance with the following schedule:

        (i) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fd in KHz) of more than 5 KHz up to and including *10* KHz: At least 83 log (fd/5) decibels;

        (ii) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fd in KHz) of more than **10** KHz up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 116 log (fd/6.1) decibels or 50 plus 10 log (P) or 70 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation; and

        (iii) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by more that 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 plus *10* log (output power in watts) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

        (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) The emission of an unmodulated carrier is prohibited except for test purposes as required for proper station and system maintenance.

        (d)  These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of harmful interference to reception in the 10.6-10.68 GHz and 31-31.3 GHz bands onboard space stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive).

        (1)  (i) Fixed stations are restricted to point-to-point operations, with each station supplying not more than −3 dBW of transmitter power to the antenna, producing not more than 40 dBW of EIRP, and radiating at an antenna main beam elevation angle of 20° or less. Licensees holding a valid authorization on August 6, 2015 to operate in this band may continue to operate as authorized, subject to proper license renewal. Licensees are urged to:

        (A) Limit the maximum transmitter power supplied to the antenna to −15 dBW; and

        (B) Employ automatic transmitter power control (ATPC).

        (ii) The maximum transmitter power supplied to the antenna of stations using ATPC may be increased by a value corresponding to the ATPC range, up to a maximum of −3 dBW.

        (2)  For fixed stations authorized after August 6, 2018, the unwanted emissions power in any 100 MHz of the 31.3-31.5 GHz band shall be limited to −38 dBW (−38 dBW/100 MHz), as measured at the input to the antenna.

        § 101.113   Transmitter power limitations.

#### § § 101.113

        (a) On any authorized frequency, the average power delivered to an antenna in this service must be the minimum amount of power necessary to carry out the communications desired. Application of this principle includes, but is not to be limited to, requiring a licensee who replaces one or more of its antennas with larger antennas to reduce its antenna input power by an amount appropriate to compensate for the increased primary lobe gain of the replacement antenna(s). In no event shall the average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to an isotropic radiator, exceed the values specified below. In cases of harmful interference, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, order a change in the effective radiated power of this station. Further, the output power of a transmitter on any authorized frequency in this service may not exceed the following:

        (b) The power of transmitters that use Automatic Transmitter Power Control shall not exceed the power input or output specified in the instrument of station authorization. The power of non-ATPC transmitters shall be maintained as near as practicable to the power input or output specified in the instrument of station authorization.

        (c)(1)  Point-to-point stations in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band for the LMDS backbone between LMDS hubs shall be limited to a maximum allowable e.i.r.p. density per carrier of 23 dBW/MHz in any one megahertz in clear air, and may exceed this limit by employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value due to precipitation and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

        (2)  LMDS applicants shall demonstrate that, under clear air operating conditions, the maximum aggregate of LMDS transmitting hub stations in a Basic Trading Area in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band will not transmit a co-frequency hub-to-subscriber e.i.r.p. spectral area density in any azimuthal direction in excess of X dBW/(MHz-km  ) when averaged over any 4.375 MHz band, where X is defined in Table 1. Individual hub stations may exceed their clear air e.i.r.p.s by employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

        (i) The e.i.r.p. aggregate spectral area density is calculated as follows:

        (ii) The climate zones in Table 1 are defined for different geographic locations within the US as shown in Appendix 28 of the ITU Radio Regulations.

        (3)  LMDS applicants shall demonstrate that, under clear air operating conditions, the maximum aggregate of LMDS transmitting hub stations in a Basic Trading Area in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band will not transmit a co-frequency hub-to-subscriber e.i.r.p. spectral area density in any azimuthal direction in excess of X dBW/(MHz-km ) when averaged over any 4.375 MHz band where X is defined in Table 2. Individual hub stations may exceed their clear air e.i.r.p.s by employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

        (i) The e.i.r.p. aggregate spectral area density is calculated as follows:

        (ii) LMDS system licensees in two or more BTAs may individually or collectively deviate from the spectral area density computed above by averaging the power over any 200 km by 400 km area, provided that the aggregate interference to the satellite receiver is no greater than if the spectral area density were as specified in Table 1. A showing to the Commission comparing both methods of computation is required and copies shall be served on any affected non-GSO MSS providers.

        (4)  LMDS hub transmitters shall employ methods to reduce average power levels received by non-geostationary mobile satellite receivers, to the extent necessary to comply with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, by employing the methods set forth below:

        (i)  LMDS hub transmitters in the LMDS service area may employ both vertical and horizontal linear polarizations such that 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub transmitters shall employ vertical polarization and 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) shall employ horizontal polarization.

        (ii)  LMDS hub transmitters in the LMDS service area may employ frequency interleaving such that 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub transmitters shall employ channel center frequencies which are different by one-half the channel bandwidth of the other 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub transmitters.

        (iii)  As alternatives to paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section, LMDS operators may employ such other methods as may be shown to achieve equivalent reductions in average power density received by non-GSO MSS satellite receivers.

        § 101.115   Directional antennas.

#### § § 101.115

        (a) Unless otherwise authorized upon specific request by the applicant, each station authorized under the rules of this part must employ a directional antenna adjusted with the center of the major lobe of radiation in the horizontal plane directed toward the receiving station with which it communicates:  where a station communicates with more than one point, a multi- or omni-directional antenna may be authorized if necessary. New Periscope antenna systems will not, under ordinary circumstances, be authorized.

        (b) Fixed stations (other than temporary fixed stations and DEMS nodal stations) operating at 932.5 MHz or higher must employ transmitting and receiving antennas (excluding second receiving antennas for operations such as space diversity) meeting the appropriate performance Standard A indicated below, except that in areas not subject to frequency congestion, antennas meeting performance Standard B may be used, subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. For frequencies with a Standard B1 and a Standard B2, in order to comply with Standard B an antenna must fully meet either Standard B1 or Standard B2. Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown in this paragraph in the following manner:

        (1) With either the maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points requirement or with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and

        (2) With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.

        (c) The Commission shall require the replacement of any antenna or periscope antenna system of a permanent fixed station operating at 932.5 MHz or higher that does not meet performance Standard A specified in paragraph (c) of this section, at the expense of the licensee operating such antenna, upon a showing that said antenna causes or is likely to cause interference to (or receive interference from) any other authorized or applied for station whereas a higher performance antenna is not likely to involve such interference. Antenna performance is expected to meet the standards of paragraph (c) of this section for parallel polarization. For cases of potential interference, an antenna will not be considered to meet Standard A unless the parallel polarization performance for the discrimination angle involved meets the requirements, even if the cross-polarization performance controls the interference.

        (d) In cases where passive reflectors are employed in conjunction with transmitting antenna systems, the foregoing paragraphs of this section also will be applicable. However, in such instances, the center of the major lobe of radiation from the antenna normally must be directed at the passive reflector, and the center of the major lobe of radiation from the passive reflector directed toward the receiving station with which it communicates.

        (e) Periscope antennas used at an electric power facility plant area will be excluded from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section on a case-by-case basis where technical considerations or safety preclude the use of other types of antenna systems.

        (f) In the 10,700-11,700 MHz band, a fixed station may employ transmitting and receiving antennas meeting performance standard B in any area. If a Fixed Service or Fixed Satellite Service licensee or applicant makes a showing that it is likely to receive interference from such fixed station and that such interference would not exist if the fixed station used an antenna meeting performance standard A, the fixed station licensee must modify its use. Specifically, the fixed station licensee must either substitute an antenna meeting performance standard A or operate its system with an EIRP reduced so as not to radiate, in the direction of the other licensee, an EIRP in excess of that which would be radiated by a station using a Category A antenna and operating with the maximum EIRP allowed by the rules. A licensee or prior applicant using an antenna that does not meet performance Standard A may object to a prior coordination notice based on interference only if such interference would be predicted to exist if the licensee or prior applicant used an antenna meeting performance standard A.

        (g) In the event harmful interference is caused to the operation of other stations, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, order changes to be made in the height, orientation, gain and radiation pattern of the antenna system.

        § 101.117   Antenna polarization.

#### § § 101.117

        Except as set forth herein, stations operating in the radio services included in this part are not limited as to the type of polarization of the radiated signal that may be employed. However, in the event interference in excess of permissible levels is caused to the operation of other stations as a result of employing other than linear polarization, the Commission may order a licensee to change its system polarization to mitigate the interference. No change in polarization may be made without prior authorization from the Commission. Unless otherwise allowed, only linear polarization (horizontal and vertical) shall be used. For LMDS systems, unless otherwise authorized, system operators are permitted to use any polarization within its service area, but only vertical and/or horizontal polarization for antennas located within 20 kilometers of the outermost edge of their service area.

> [68 FR 4957, Jan. 31, 2003]

        § 101.119   Simultaneous use of common antenna structures.

#### § § 101.119

        The simultaneous use of common antenna structures by more than one radio station, or by one of more domestic public radio stations and one or more stations of any other class or service, may be authorized: provided, however, that each licensee or user of any such structure is responsible for maintaining the structure, and for painting and illuminating the structure when obstruction marking is required by the Commission. (See § 101.21(a).)

        § 101.125   Temporary fixed antenna height restrictions.

#### § § 101.125

        The overall antenna structure heights employed by mobile stations in the Local Television Transmission Service and by stations authorized to operate at temporary fixed locations may not exceed the height criteria set forth in § 17.7 of this chapter, unless in each instance, authorization for use of a specific maximum antenna height (above ground and above mean sea level) for each location has been obtained from the Commission prior to erection of the antenna. Requests for such authorization must show the inclusive dates of the proposed operation. (Complete information as to rules concerning the construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures is contained in part 17 of this chapter.)

        § 101.129   Transmitter location.

#### § § 101.129

        (a) The applicant must determine, prior to filing an application for a radio station authorization, that the antenna site specified therein is adequate to render the service proposed. In cases of questionable antenna locations, it is desirable to conduct propagation tests to indicate the field intensity which may be expected in the principal areas or at the fixed points of communication to be served, particularly where severe shadow problems may be expected. In considering applications proposing the use of such locations, the Commission may require site survey tests to be made pursuant to an experimental license under part 5 of this chapter. In such cases, propagation tests should be conducted in accordance with recognized engineering methods and should be made with a transmitting antenna simulating, as near as possible, the proposed antenna installation. Full data obtained from such surveys and its analysis, including a description of the methods used and the name, address and qualifications of the engineer making the survey, must be supplied to the Commission.

        (b) In the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, licensees must not locate MVDDS transmitting antennas within 10 km of any qualifying NGSO FSS receiver unless mutual agreement is obtained between the MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees. Such agreements must be retained by the licensees and made available for inspection by interested parties upon request.

        (1) A qualifying NGSO FSS receiver, for the purposes of this section, is deemed to be one that is in regular use by an NGSO FSS subscriber for normal reception purposes in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band and not one for monitoring or testing purposes. In addition, qualifying receivers must either be in operation on the date or already be under construction and then operating within thirty days of the date that the MVDDS licensee notifies the NGSO FSS licensee of its intent to construct a new MVDDS transmitting antenna at a specified location.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 10 kilometer spacing requirement for each MVDDS transmitting antenna site shall not apply with respect to NGSO FSS receivers that might be installed or become operational (except for those under construction and operating within thirty days as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) subsequent to the original date that the MVDDS licensee provided notice of its intention to construct a given transmission facility.

        (3) In the event that a proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna for which notice has been duly given to the NGSO FSS licensees has not been placed in normal operation within one calendar year of the date of notice, then the MVDDS licensee loses the benefit of the original notice. Upon such anniversary, the MVDDS licensee must re-determine compliance with the minimum 10 kilometer spacing requirement based upon locations of qualifying NGSO FSS receivers on that anniversary date. A new determination of compliance with the spacing requirement shall be made for each succeeding anniversary of non-operation for each proposed MVDDS transmission site or additional antenna. This provision contemplates that failure to commence normal operation at a given MVDDS transmitting antenna site within one year of the date of NGSO FSS notification may require successive relocations of the proposed transmitter site in order to meet the minimum spacing distance as determined on each anniversary of non-operation.

        § 101.131   Transmitter construction and installation.

#### § § 101.131

        (a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions must be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the licensee.

        (b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter must be equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter is employed, the modulation filter must be installed between the transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage of the transmitter.

        (c) Each transmitter employed in these services must be equipped with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication at the transmitter when its control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter. In addition, facilities must be provided at each transmitter to permit the transmitter to be turned on and off independently of any remote control circuits associated therewith.

        (d) At each transmitter control point the following facilities must be installed:

        (1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter; and

        (2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter carrier on and off at will.

        (e) Transmitter control circuits from any control point must be so installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit will not cause the transmitter to radiate: provided, however, That this provision will not be applicable to control circuits of stations which normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which are under the effective operational control of responsible operating personnel 24 hours per day.

        § 101.133   Limitations on use of transmitters.

#### § § 101.133

        (a) Transmitters licensed for operation in Common Carrier services may be concurrently licensed or used for non-common carrier communication purposes. Mobile units may be concurrently licensed or used for non-common carrier communication purposes provided that the transmitter is certificated for use in each service.

        (b) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations authorized in this service may communicate with associated operational-fixed stations and fixed receivers and with units of associated stations in the mobile service licensed under Private Radio Service rule parts. In addition, intercommunication is permitted with other licensed stations and with U.S. Government stations in those cases which require cooperation or coordination of activities or when cooperative use arrangements in accordance with § 101.135 are contemplated; provided, however, that where communication is desired with stations authorized to operate under the authority of a foreign jurisdiction, prior approval of this Commission must be obtained; And provided further, That the authority under which such other stations operate does not prohibit the intercommunication.

        (c) Two or more persons or governmental entities eligible for private operational fixed point-to-point microwave licenses may use the same transmitting equipment under the following terms and conditions:

        (1) Each licensee complies with the general operating requirements set out in this part;

        (2) Each licensee is eligible for the frequency(ies) on which the facility operates; and

        (3) Each licensee must have the ability to access the transmitter(s) that it is authorized to operate under the multiple licensing arrangement.

        (d)  LMDS licensees shall not operate transmitters from subscriber locations in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band.

        (e) Existing private operational fixed wireless licensees applying to become common carrier wireless licensees shall comply with all provisions of the Communications Act and the Commission's rules. Applicants must take all required filings, including FCC Form 601, and receive all necessary Commission approval prior to operating as a common carrier wireless licensee. The regulatory fee associated with FCC wireless application Form 601 is waived for applicants who are existing private operational fixed licensees seeking common carrier status, provided that such licensees have also complied with all other discontinuance requirements of Title II of the Act. Applicants are responsible for all other Commission regulatory fees.

        Licensees of Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave radio stations may share the use of their facilities on a non-profit basis or may offer service on a for-profit private carrier basis, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

        (a) Persons or governmental entities licensed to operate radio systems pursuant to subpart H of this part on any of the private radio frequencies set out in § 101.101 may share such systems with, or provide private carrier service to, any eligible entity for licensing under this part, regardless of individual eligibility restrictions, provided that the communications being carried are permissible under § 101.603.

        (b) The licensee must maintain access to and control over all facilities authorized under its license;

        (c) All sharing and private carrier arrangements must be conducted pursuant to a written agreement to be kept as part of the station records; and

        (d) The licensee must keep an up-to-date list of system sharers and private carrier subscribers and the basis of their eligibility under this part. Such records must be kept current and must be made available upon request for inspection by the Commission.

        (e) Applicants licensed in the MAS frequencies after June 2, 2000, shall not provide service to others on a for-profit private carrier basis in the 928-928.85/952-952.85/956.25-956.45 MHz bands and the 932.25-932.5/941.25-941.5 MHz bands.

        (a) Unless specified otherwise, transmitters used in the private operational fixed and common carrier fixed point-to-point microwave and point-to-multipoint services under this part must be a type that has been approved for compliance under Supplier's Declaration of Conformity.

        (b) Any transmitter to be produced for use under the rules of this part may be approved under the equipment authorization procedures set forth in part 2 of this chapter.

        (c) Certification for an individual transmitter may also be requested by an applicant for a station authorization, pursuant to the procedures set forth in part 2 of this chapter.

        (d) A transmitter presently shown on an instrument of authorization, which operates on an assigned frequency in the 890-940 MHz band and has not received a grant of certification, may continue to be used by the licensee without certification provided such transmitter continues otherwise to comply with the applicable requirements of this chapter.

        (e) Certification or Supplier's Declaration of Conformity is not required for portable transmitters operating with peak output power not greater than 250 mW. If operation of such equipment causes harmful interference the FCC may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective action as is necessary to eliminate the interference.

        § 101.141   Microwave modulation.

#### § § 101.141

        (a) Microwave transmitters employing digital modulation techniques and operating below 25.25 GHz (except for MVDDS stations in the 12,200-12,700 MHz band) must, with appropriate multiplex equipment, comply with the following additional requirements:

        (1) The bit rate, in bits per second, must be equal to or greater than the bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz (e.g., to be acceptable, equipment transmitting at a 20 Mb/s rate must not require a bandwidth of greater than 20 MHz), except the bandwidth used to calculate the minimum rate may not include any authorized guard band.

        (i) Stations authorized prior to December 1, 1988 may install equipment after that date with no minimum bit rate. Equipment applied for or authorized prior to April 1, 2005 in the 21.2-23.6 GHz band may be installed with no minimum bit rate.

        (ii) However, any digital equipment applied for after April 1, 2005 and equipment replacing existing equipment in the 21.2-23.6 GHz band must meet the bit rate standard.

        (2) Equipment to be used for voice transmission placed in service, authorized, or applied for on or before June 1, 1997 in the 2110 to 2130 and 2160 to 2180 MHz bands must be capable of satisfactory operation within the authorized bandwidth to encode at least 96 voice channels. Equipment placed in service, authorized, or applied for on or before June 1, 1997 in the 3700-4200, 5925-6425 (30 MHz bandwidth), and 10,700-11,700 MHz (30 and 40 MHz bandwidths) bands must be capable of satisfactory operation within the authorized bandwidth to encode at least 1152 voice channels. These required loading levels may be reduced by a factor of 1/N provided that N transmitters may be operated satisfactorily, over the same radio path, within an authorized bandwidth less than, or equal to, the maximum authorizable bandwidth (e.g., the 1152 channel requirement may be reduced to 576 if two transmitters can be satisfactorily operated over the same path within the maximum bandwidth). Where certificated equipment is designed to operate on the same frequency in a cross polarized configuration to meet the above capacity requirements, the Commission will require, at the time additional transmitters are authorized, that both polarizations of a frequency be used before a new frequency assignment is made, unless a single transmitter installation was found to be justified by the Commission at the time it authorized the first transmitter.

        (3)(i) Except as noted in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the payload capacity of equipment shall meet the following minimum efficiency standards:

        (ii) Traffic loading payload shall exceed 50 percent of payload capacity within 30 months of licensing. During anomalous signal fading, licensees subject to the capacity and loading requirements may adjust to a modulation specified in their authorization if such modulation is necessary to allow licensees to maintain communications, even if the modulation will not comply with the capacity and loading requirements specified in this paragraph. Links that must comply with the capacity and loading requirements that use equipment capable of adjusting modulation must be designed using generally accepted multipath fading and rain fading models to meet the specified capacity and loading requirements at least 99.95% of the time, in the aggregate of both directions in a two-way link.

        (4) If a transmitter is authorized to operate in a bandwidth that is not listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, it must meet the minimum payload capacity and traffic loading requirements of the next largest channel bandwidth listed in the table; e.g., if the authorized bandwidth is 3.5 MHz, the minimum payload capacity must be 12.3 Mbits/s.

        (5) Transmitters carrying digital motion video motion material are exempt from the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, provided that at least 50 percent of the payload is digital video motion material and the minimum bit rate specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is met. In the 6, 10, and 11 GHz bands, concatenation of multiple contiguous channels is permitted for channels of equal bandwidth on center frequencies, provided no other channels are available and the minimum payload capacity requirements are met.

        (6) Digital systems using bandwidths of 10 MHz or larger will be considered 50 percent loaded when at least 50 percent of their total capacity is being used. For purposes of this subsection, a Fixed Service channel is being used if it is attached to a communications system that is capable of providing data to it at a rate that is sufficient to occupy at least 50 percent of the payload capacity of the Fixed Service channel, after header compression is applied.

        (7) Equipment placed in service after June 1, 1997 and prior to October 5, 2012 may comply with the provisions of § 101.141(a)(3) in effect as of the date the equipment was placed in service.

        (b) For purposes of compliance with the emission limitation requirements of § 101.111(a)(2) and the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, digital modulation techniques are considered as being employed when digital modulation occupies 50 percent or more to the total peak frequency deviation of a transmitted radio frequency carrier. The total peak frequency deviation will be determined by adding the deviation produced by the digital modulation signal and the deviation produced by any frequency division multiplex (FDM) modulation used. The deviation (D) produced by the FDM signal must be determined in accordance with § 2.202(f) of this chapter.

        (c) Analog Modulation. Except for video transmission, an application for an initial working channel for a given route will not be accepted for filing where the anticipated loading (within five years for voice, or other period subject to reasonable projection) is less than the minimum specified for the following frequency bands. Absent extraordinary circumstances, applications proposing additional frequencies over existing routes will not be granted unless it is shown that the traffic load will shortly exhaust the capacity of the existing equipment. Where no construction of radio facilities is requested, licensees must submit this evidence with their filing of any necessary authority required pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act and part 63 of this chapter.

        § 101.145   Interference to geostationary-satellites.

#### § § 101.145

        These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of harmful interference to reception in the bands 2655-2690 MHz, 5925-7075 MHz, and 12.7-13.25 GHz on board geostationary-space stations in the fixed-satellite service.

        (a) Stations authorized prior to July 1, 1976 in the band 2655-2690 MHz, which exceed the power levels in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are permitted to operate indefinitely, provided that the operation of such stations does not result in harmful interference to reception in these bands on board geostationary space stations.

        (b)  No directional transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in these bands with EIRP greater than 35 dBW may be aimed within 2 degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction. However, exception may be made in unusual circumstances upon a showing that there is no reasonable alternative to the transmission path proposed. If there is no evidence that such exception would cause possible harmful interference to an authorized satellite system, said transmission path may be authorized on waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed:

        (1) + 47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the stationary satellite orbit; or

        (2) + 47 to + 55 dBW, on a linear decibel scale (8 dB per degree) for any antenna beam directed between 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees of the stationary orbit.

        (c)  No directional transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in this band with EIRP greater than 45 dBW may be aimed within 1.5 degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction.

        (d) Methods for calculating the azimuths to be avoided may be found in: CCIR Report No. 393 (Green Books), New Delhi, 1970; in “Radio-Relay Antenna Pointing for controlled Interference With Geostationary-Satellites” by C. W. Lundgren and A. S. May, Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 48, No. 10, pp. 3387-3422, December 1969; and in “Geostationary Orbit Avoidance Computer Program” by Richard G.

        § 101.147   Frequency assignments.

#### § § 101.147

        (a) Frequencies in the following bands are available for assignment for fixed microwave services.

        (b) Frequencies normally available for assignment in this service are set forth with applicable limitations in the following tables: 928-960 MHz Multiple address system (MAS) frequencies are available for the point-to-multipoint and point-to-point transmission of a licensee's products or services, excluding video entertainment material, to a licensee's customer or for its own internal communications. The paired frequencies listed in this section are used for two-way communications between a master station and remote stations. Ancillary one-way communications on paired frequencies are permitted on a case-by-case basis. Ancillary communications between interrelated master stations are permitted on a secondary basis. The normal channel bandwidth assigned will be 12.5 kHz. EA licensees, however, may combine contiguous channels without limit or justification. Site-based licensees may combine contiguous channels up to 50 kHz, and more than 50 kHz only upon a showing of adequate justification. Any bandwidth (12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or greater) authorized in accordance with this section may be subdivided into narrower bandwidths to create additional (or sub) frequencies without the need to specify each discrete frequency within the specific bandwidth. Equipment that is used to create additional frequencies by narrowing bandwidth (whether authorized for a 12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or greater bandwidth) will be required to meet, at a minimum, the ±0.00015 percent tolerance requirement so that all subfrequencies will be within the emission mask. Systems licensed for frequencies in these MAS bands prior to August 1, 1975, may continue to operate as authorized until June 11, 1996, at which time they must comply with current MAS operations based on the 12.5 kHz channelization set forth in this paragraph. Systems licensed between August 1, 1975, and January 1, 1981, inclusive, are required to comply with the grandfathered 25 kHz standard bandwidth and channelization requirements set forth in this paragraph. Systems originally licensed after January 1, 1981, and on or before May 11, 1988, with bandwidths of 25 kHz and above, will be grandfathered indefinitely.

        (1) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are designated for private internal use and are subject to site-based licensing.

        (2) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are designated for private internal use and are subject to site-based licensing.

        (3) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are not restricted to private internal use and are licensed by geographic area. Incumbent facilities must be protected.

        (4) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are licensed by either economic area or on a site-by-site basis.

        (p) —(1)  The Commission has allocated the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for use by the Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS), the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS), and the Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed Satellite Service (NGSO FSS). MVDDS shall be licensed on a non-harmful interference co-primary basis to existing DBS operations and on a co-primary basis with NGSO FSS stations in this band. MVDDS use can be on a common carrier and/or non-common carrier basis and can use channels of any desired bandwidth up to the maximum of 500 MHz provided the EIRP does not exceed 14 dBm per 24 megahertz. Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations authorized after September 9, 1983, are licensed on a non-harmful interference basis to DBS and are required to make any and all adjustments necessary to prevent harmful interference to operating domestic DBS receivers. Incumbent public safety licensees shall be afforded protection from MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees, however all other private operational fixed licensees shall be secondary to DBS, MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees. As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts applications for new licenses for point-to-point private operational fixed stations in this band, however, incumbent licensees and previously filed applicants may file applications for minor modifications and amendments (as defined in § 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer of control, or assignment of license. Notwithstanding any other provisions, no private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations are permitted to cause harmful interference to broadcasting-satellite stations of other countries operating in accordance with the Region 2 plan for the Broadcasting-Satellite Service established at the 1983 WARC.

        (2)  50 MHz authorized bandwidth.

        (i) 5 MHz channels:

        (iv) 25 MHz bandwidth channels:

        (v) 50 MHz bandwidth channels:

        (q) Special provisions for incumbent low power, limited coverage systems in the band segments 12.2-12.7 GHz.

        (1) As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts applications for new stations in this service and incumbent stations may remain in service provided they do not cause harmful interference to any other primary services licensed in this band as described in paragraph (p) of this section. However, incumbent licensees and previously filed applicants may file applications for minor modifications and amendments (as defined in § 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer of control, or assignment of license.

        (2) Prior to December 8, 2000, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this part, the frequency pairs 12.220/12.460 GHz, 12.260/12.500 GHz, 12.300/12.540 GHz and 12.340/12.580 GHz, were authorized for low power, limited coverage systems subject to the following provisions:

        (i) Maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) shall be 55 dBm;

        (ii) The rated transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.5 watts;

        (iii) Frequency tolerance shall be maintained to within 0.01 percent of the assigned frequency;

        (iv) Maximum beamwidth shall not exceed 4 degrees. However, the sidelobe suppression criteria contained in § 101.115 shall not apply, except that a minimum front-to-back ratio of 38 dB shall apply;

        (v) Upon showing of need, a maximum bandwidth of 12 MHz may be authorized per frequency assigned;

        (vi) Radio systems authorized under the provisions of this section shall have no more than three hops in tandem, except upon showing of need, but in any event the maximum tandem length shall not exceed 40 km (25 miles);

        (vii) Interfering signals at the receiver antenna terminals of stations authorized under this section shall not exceed −90 dBm and −70 dBm respectively, for co-channel and adjacent channel interfering signals, and

        (viii) Stations authorized under the provisions of this section shall provide the protection from interference specified in § 101.105 to stations operating in accordance with the provisions of this part.

        (r)  Operation of stations using frequencies in these bands is permitted to the extent specified in this paragraph. Until November 19, 2012, stations operating in the band 18.3-18.58 GHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the Commission as of November 19, 2002 shall operate on a shared co-primary basis with other services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this chapter. Until October 31, 2011, operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz and low power systems operating pursuant to paragraph (r)(10) of this section shall operate on a co-primary basis. Until June 8, 2010, stations operating in the band 18.58-18.8 GHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the Commission as of June 8, 2000 may continue those operations on a shared co-primary basis with other services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this chapter. Until June 8, 2010, stations operating in the band 18.8-19.3 GHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the Commission as of September 18, 1998 may continue those operations on a shared co-primary basis with other services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this chapter. After November 19, 2012, stations operating in the band 18.3-18.58 GHz are not entitled to protection from fixed-satellite service operations and must not cause unacceptable interference to fixed-satellite service station operations. After June 8, 2010, operations in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band are not entitled to protection from fixed-satellite service operations and must not cause unacceptable interference to fixed-satellite service station operations. After November 19, 2002, no applications for new stations for 47 CFR part 101 licenses will be accepted in the 18.3-18.58 GHz band. After June 8, 2000, no applications for new stations for 47 CFR part 101 licenses will be accepted in the 18.58-19.3 GHz band. Licensees, except 24 GHz band licensees, may use either a two-way link or one frequency of a frequency pair for a one-way link and must coordinate proposed operations pursuant to the procedures required in § 101.103 of this subpart. (Note, however, that stations authorized as of September 9, 1983, to use frequencies in the band 17.7-19.7 GHz may, upon proper application, continue to be authorized for such operations, consistent with the above conditions related to the 18.58-19.3 GHz band.) Applicants for one-way spectrum from 17.7-18.58 GHz for multichannel video programming distribution are governed by paragraph (r)(6) of this section. Licensees are also allowed to use one-way (unpaired) channels in the 17.7-17.74 GHz sub-band to pair with other channels in the FS portions of the 18 GHz band where, for example, the return pair is already in use and therefore blocked or in TDD systems. Stations used for MVPD operations in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band must coordinate with the Federal Government before operating in the zones specified in § 1.924(e) of this chapter.

        (1) 1.25 Megahertz maximum authorized bandwidth channels:

        (2) 2 Megahertz maximum authorized bandwidth channel:

        (6) MVPD use: Multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) can use any size channels for one-way operations in the 17.7-18.58 GHz band for any permissible communications specified for this band in § 101.603 provided that they have coordinated the appropriate emission designators and power, but must request contiguous spectrum (minus spectrum that is already licensed or prior coordinated in the area and thus blocked). MVPD systems must meet the efficiency requirements of § 101.141. Spectrum at 18.3-18.58 GHz is only available for grandfathered stations. See § 101.85.

        (7) 10 Megahertz maximum authorized bandwidth channels:

        (8) 20 Megahertz maximum authorized bandwidth channels:

        (12) 80 Megahertz maximum authorized bandwidth channels:

        (13) The following frequencies on channels 35-39 are available for point-to-multipoint systems and are available by geographic area licensing in the 24 GHz Service to be used as the licensee desires. The 24 GHz spectrum can be aggregated or disaggregated and does not have to be used in the transmit/receive manner shown except to comply with international agreements along the U.S. borders. Channels 35 through 39 are licensed in the 24 GHz Service by Economic Areas for any digital fixed service. Channels may be used at either nodal or subscriber station locations for transmit or receive but must be coordinated with adjacent channel and adjacent area users in accordance with the provisions of § 101.509 of this subpart. Stations also must comply with international coordination agreements.

        (14)  Notwithstanding other provisions in 47 CFR part 101 and except for specified areas around Washington, DC, and Denver, Colorado, licensees of point-to-multipoint channel pairs 25-29 identified in paragraph (r)(13) of this section may continue to operate in accordance with the requirements of § 101.85 and may operate multiple low power transmitting devices within a defined service area. Operations are prohibited within 55 km when used outdoor and within 20 km when used indoor of the coordinates 38 deg.48′ N/76 deg.52′ W (Washington, DC area) and 39 deg.43′ N/104 deg.46′ W (Denver, Colorado area). The service area will be a 28 kilometer omni directional radius originating from specified center reference coordinates. The specified center coordinates must be no closer than 56 kilometers from any co-channel nodal station or the specified center coordinates of another co-channel system. Applicants/licensees do not need to specify the location of each individual transmitting device operating within their defined service areas. Such operations are subject to the following requirements on the low power transmitting devices:

        (i) Power must not exceed one watt EIRP and 100 milliwatts transmitter output power;

        (ii) A frequency tolerance of 0.001% must be maintained; and

        (iii) The mean power of emissions shall be attenuated in accordance with the following schedule:

        (A) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 50 percent of the channel bandwidth and is within the bands 18,820-18,870 MHz or 19,160-19,210 MHz:

        (B) In any 4 kHz band the center frequency of which is outside the bands 18.820-18.870 GHz: At least 43 + 10 log P (mean output power in watts) decibels.

        (iv) Low power stations authorized in the band 18.8-19.3 GHz after June 8, 2000, are restricted to indoor use only. No new licenses will be authorized for applications received after April 1, 2002.

        (s)  50 MHz authorized bandwidth.

        (8)  Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this part, the frequency band segment 21.8-22.0 GHz paired with the frequency band segment 23.0-23.2 GHz may be authorized for low power, limited coverage systems subject to the following provisions:

        (i) The maximum EIRP shall be 55 dBm and the rated transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.100 Watts;

        (ii) In the band segments from 21.8-22.0 GHz and 23.0-23.2 GHz, the frequency tolerance for stations authorized on or before April 1, 2005 is 0.05%. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that date may continue to operate after that date with a frequency tolerance of 0.05%, provided that it does not cause harmful interference to the operation of any other licensee. The frequency tolerance of § 101.107(a) shall apply to stations applied for after April 1, 2005;

        (iii) The maximum beamwidth shall not exceed 4 degrees;

Any location allotted for one range of MSAs may be taken from an MSA below that range.

        (3)(i) Any non-GSO MSS licensee may at any time specify sets of geographic coordinates for feeder link earth station complexes with each earth station contained therein to be located at least 75 nautical miles from the borders of the 100 largest MSAs.

        (ii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, non-GSO MSS feeder link earth station complexes shall be entitled to accommodation only if the affected non-GSO MSS licensee preapplies to the Commission for a feeder link earth station complex or certifies to the Commission within sixty days of receiving a copy of an LMDS application that it intends to file an application for a feeder link earth station complex within six months of the date of receipt of the LMDS application.

        (iii) If said non-GSO MSS licensee application is filed later than six months after certification to the Commission, the LMDS and non-GSO MSS entities shall still cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems, but the LMDS licensee shall not be obligated to re-engineer its proposal or make changes to its system.

        (4) LMDS licensees or applicants proposing to operate hub stations on frequencies in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band at locations outside of the 100 largest MSAs or within a distance of 150 nautical miles from a set of geographic coordinates specified under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) of this section shall serve copies of their applications on all non-GSO MSS applicants, permitees or licensees meeting the criteria specified in § 25.257(a). Non-GSO MSS licensees or applicants shall serve copies of their feeder link earth station applications, after the LMDS auction, on any LMDS applicant or licensee within a distance of 150 nautical miles from the geographic coordinates that it specified under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) of this section. Any necessary coordination shall commence upon notification by the party receiving an application to the party who filed the application. The results of any such coordination shall be reported to the Commission within sixty days. The non-GSO MSS earth station licensee shall also provide all such LMDS licensees with a copy of its channel plan.

        (z)  (1) Those applicants who are approved in accordance with FCC Form 601 will each be granted a single, non-exclusive nationwide license. Site-by-site registration is on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will be in the Universal Licensing System until the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announces by public notice, the implementation of a third-party database.  47 CFR 101.1523. Links may not operate until NTIA approval is received. Licensees may use these bands for any point-to-point non-broadcast service.

        (2) Prior links shall be protected using the interference protection criteria set forth in section 101.105. For transmitters employing digital modulation techniques and operating in the 71,000-76,000 MHz or 81,000-86,000 MHz bands, the licensee must construct a system that meets a minimum bit rate of 0.125 bits per second per Hertz of bandwidth. For transmitters that operate in the 92,000-94,000 MHz or 94,100-95,000 MHz bands, licensees must construct a system that meets a minimum bit rate of 1.0 bit per second per Hertz of bandwidth. If it is determined that a licensee has not met these loading requirements, then the database will be modified to limit coordination rights to the spectrum that is loaded and the licensee will lose protection rights on spectrum that has not been loaded.

        (3) The following channel plans apply to the 71,000-76,000 MHz and 81,000-86,000 MHz bands:

        § 101.509   Interference protection criteria.

#### § § 101.509

        (a) As a condition for use of frequencies in this service each licensee is required to:

        (1) Engineer the system to be reasonably compatible with adjacent and co-channel operations in the same or adjacent areas on all frequencies; and

        (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve whatever potential interference and transmission security problems may be present in adjacent and co-channel operations.

        (b) All harmful interference to other users of co-channel and adjacent channel use in the same or adjacent geographical area are prohibited. In areas where Economic Areas are in close proximity, careful consideration should be given to minimum power requirements and to the location, height, and radiation pattern of the transmitting and receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of potential interference before bringing the matter to the attention of the Commission.

        (c) Licensee shall coordinate their facilities whenever the facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop operational agreements with relevant licensees in the same or adjacent areas. Incumbent SMSA licensee(s) shall retain exclusive rights to its channel(s) within its SMSA and must be protected.

        (d) Licensees shall comply with the appropriate coordination agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico concerning cross-border sharing and use of the 24 GHz bands which may require using channels pairs in accordance with the table in § 101.147(r)(9).

        (e) The Commission recommends that coordination is not necessary if the power flux density (pfd) at the boundary of the relevant adjacent area is lower than −114 dBW/m  in any 1 MHz. This value can be changed and agreed upon by both coordinating parties. Licensees should be able to deploy with a pfd up to −94 dBW/m  in any 1 MHz at the boundary of the relevant adjacent area without negatively affecting the successful operations of the adjacent area licensee.

          (1)  (i) Within Lines A, B, C, and D, as defined in § 1.928(e) of this chapter, along the U.S./Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a secondary basis and may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at the border greater than −100 dBW/m  nor −94 dBW/m , respectively. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may operate on a secondary basis provided they do not exceed the respective PFDs shown above. PFD can be determined using the following formula: PFD (dBW/m ) = 10 log [EIRP/4π(D ], where EIRP is in watts, D is in meters, and the power is relative to an isotropic radiator. The technical parameters are also limited by tables 1 and 2:

          (ii) Maximum antenna height above average terrain for master stations operating at a maximum power shall not exceed 150 meters. Above 150 meters, the power of master stations shall be in accordance with following table:

          (2)  Between Lines A and B and between Lines C and D, as defined in § 1.928(e) of this chapter, along the U.S./Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 928.50-928.75 MHz and 952.50-952.75 MHz bands are on an unprotected basis and may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at or beyond the border greater than −100 dBW/m . The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the bands 928.25-928.50 MHz and 952.25-952.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may operate on an unprotected basis provided they do not exceed the PFD above. Frequencies in the bands 928.00-928.25 MHz, 928.75-929.00 MHz, 952.00-952.25 MHz, and 952.75-952.85 MHz are available for use on a coordinated, first-in-time, shared basis subject to protecting grandfathered stations. New stations must provide a minimum of 145 km (90 miles) separation or alternatively limit the actual PFD of the proposed station to −100 dBW/m , at the existing co-channel master stations of the other country, or as mutually agreed upon on a case-by-case basis. Coordination is not required if the PFD at the border is lower than −100 dBW/m . The technical criteria are also limited by the following:

          (3)  Within 113 kilometers of the U.S./Mexico border, U.S. stations operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a secondary basis (non-interference to Mexican primary licensees) and may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at or beyond the border greater than −100 dBW/m . Upon notification from the Commission, U.S. licensees must take proper measures to eliminate any harmful interference caused to Mexican primary assignments. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, and Mexican stations may operate on a secondary basis (non-interference to U.S. primary licensees) provided they do not exceed the PFD shown above. Stations using the 932-932.5 MHz band shall be limited to the maximum effective isotropic radiated power of 50 watts (17 dBW). Stations using the 941-941.5 MHz band shall meet the limits in the following table:

      Subpart P—Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service Rules for the 12.2-12.7 GHz Band

**Source:** Source: 69 FR 31746, June 7, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

        § 101.1401   Service areas.

#### § § 101.1401

        Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) is licensed on the basis of Designated Market Areas (DMAs). The 214 DMA service areas are based on the 210 Designated Market Areas delineated by Nielsen Media Research and published in its publication entitled U.S. Television Household Estimates, September 2002, plus four FCC-defined DMA-like service areas.

        (a) Alaska—Balance of State (all geographic areas of Alaska not included in Nielsen's three DMAs for the state: Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau);

        (b) Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands;

        (c) Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands; and

        (d) American Samoa.

        § 101.1403   Broadcast carriage requirements.

#### § § 101.1403

        MVDDS licensees are not required to provide all local television channels to subscribers within its area and thus are not required to comply with the must-carry rules, nor the local signal carriage requirements of the  See Multichannel Video and Cable Television Service Rules, Subpart D (Carriage of Television Broadcast Signals), 47 CFR 76.51-76.70. If an MVDDS licensee meets the statutory definition of Multiple Video Programming Distributor (MVPD), the retransmission consent requirement of section 325(b)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1)) shall apply to that MVDDS licensee. Any MVDDS licensee that is an MVPD must obtain the prior express authority of a broadcast station before retransmitting that station's signal, subject to the exceptions contained in section 325(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(2)). Network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and leased access rules shall not be imposed on MVDDS licensees.

        § 101.1405   Channeling plan.

#### § § 101.1405

        Each license shall have one spectrum block of 500 megahertz per geographic area that can be divided into any size channels. Disaggregation is not allowed.

        § 101.1407   Permissible operations for MVDDS.

#### § § 101.1407

        MVDDS licensees must use spectrum in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for any digital fixed non-broadcast service (broadcast services are intended for reception of the general public and not on a subscribership basis) including one-way direct-to-home/office wireless service. Mobile and aeronautical services are not authorized. Two-way services may be provided by using other spectrum or media for the return or upstream path.

        § 101.1409   Treatment of incumbent licensees.

#### § § 101.1409

        Terrestrial private operational fixed point-to-point licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band which were licensed prior to MVDDS or NGSO FSS satellite stations are incumbent point-to-point stations and are not entitled to protection from harmful interference caused by later MVDDS or NGSO FSS entrants in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, except for public safety stations which must be protected. MVDDS and NGSO FSS operators have the responsibility of resolving any harmful interference problems that their operations may cause to these public safety incumbent point-to-point operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Incumbent public safety terrestrial point-to-point licensees may only make minor changes to their stations without losing this protection. This does not relieve current point-to-point licensees of their obligation to protect BSS operations in the subject frequency band. All point-to-point applications, including low-power operations, for new licenses, major amendments to pending applications, or major modifications to existing licenses for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are no longer accepted except for renewals and changes in ownership. See § 1.929 of this chapter for definitions of major and minor changes.

        § 101.1411   Regulatory status and eligibility.

#### § § 101.1411

        (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to provide one-way video programming and data services on a non-common carrier and/or on a common carrier basis. MVDDS is not required to be treated as a common carrier service unless it is providing non-Internet voice and data services through the public switched network.

        (b) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are subject to the requirements set forth in § 101.7.

        (c) Any entity, other than one precluded by §§ 101.7 and 101.1412, is eligible for authorization to provide MVDDS under this part. Authorization will be granted upon proper application filing in accordance with the Commission's rules.

        § 101.1412   MVDDS eligibility restrictions for cable operators.

#### § § 101.1412

        (a) Eligibility for MVDDS license. No cable operator, nor any entity owning an attributable interest in a cable operator, shall have an attributable interest in an MVDDS license if such cable operator's service area significantly overlaps the MVDDS license area, as “significantly overlaps” is defined in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b) Definition of cable operator. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “cable operator” means a company that is franchised to provide cable service, as defined in 47 CFR 76.5(ff) of this chapter, in all or part of the MVDDS license area.

        (c) For the purpose of this section, the term “MVPD household” refers to a household that subscribes to one or more Multichannel Video Program Distributors (MVPDs), as defined in 47 CFR 76.1000(e) of this chapter.

        (d) Waiver of restriction. Upon completion of the initial award of an MVDDS license, a cable operator may petition for a waiver of the restriction on eligibility based upon a showing that changed circumstances or new evidence indicate that no significant likelihood of substantial competitive harm will result from the operator retaining an attributable interest in the MVDDS license.

        (e) Significant overlap with service area. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, significant overlap occurs when a cable operator's subscribers in the MVDDS license area make up thirty-five percent or more of the MVPD households in that MVDDS license area.

        (f) Definition of attributable interest. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity shall be considered to have an attributable interest in a cable operator or MVDDS licensee pursuant to the following criteria:

        (1) A controlling interest shall constitute an attributable interest. Controlling interest means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative control) over the operation of the entity, in whatever manner exercised.

        (2) Any general partnership interest in a partnership;

        (3) Partnership and similar ownership interests (including limited partnership interests) amounting to 20 percent or more of the total partnership interests, calculated according to both the percentage of equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses;

        (4) Any stock interest amounting to 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an entity;

        (5) Any voting or non-voting stock interest, amounting to 20 percent or more of the total outstanding stock of an entity;

        (6) Stock interests held in trust that exceed the limit set forth in paragraph (f) of this section shall constitute an attributable interest of any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, of any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, in the case of stock held in trust, of any person who has the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held in trust shall constitute an attributable interest of such grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.

        (7) Debt and interests such as warrants and convertible debentures, options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not constitute attributable interests unless and until conversion is effected.

        (8) An interest in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Registered Limited Liability Partnership (RLLP) amounting to 20 percent or more, shall constitute an attributable interest of each such limited partner.

        (9) Officers and directors of a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, or an entity that controls such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, shall be considered to have an attributable interest in such cable operator or MVDDS licensee.

        (10) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations or other entities shall be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that, if the ownership for any interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest.

        (11) Any person who manages the operations of a cable operator or an MVDDS licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have an attributable interest in such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, if such person or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence:

        (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;

        (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or

        (iii) The prices charged for such services.

        (12) Any person or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing arrangement with a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, or an affiliate of such entity, shall be considered to have an attributable interest in such cable operator, MVDDS licensee, or affiliate, if such person or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine:

        (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;

        (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or

        (iii) The prices charged for such services.

        (g)  Any cable operator, or any entity owning an attributable interest in a cable operator, that would otherwise be barred from acquiring an attributable interest in an MVDDS license by the eligibility restriction in paragraph (a) of this section, may be a party to an MVDDS application ( have an attributable interest in the applicant), and such applicant will be eligible for an MVDDS license, pursuant to the divestiture procedures set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section.

        (1) Divestiture shall be limited to the following prescribed means:

        (i) An MVDDS applicant holding an attributable interest in a cable operator may divest such interest in the cable company.

        (ii) Other MVDDS applicants disqualified under paragraph (a) of this section, will be permitted to:

        (A) Partition and divest that portion of the existing service area that causes it to exceed the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of this section, subject to applicable regulations of state and local governments; or

        (B) Partition and divest that portion of the MVDDS geographic service area that exceeds the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (iii) Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required period of time, as long as the MVDDS applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee and the trustee may dispose of the license as it sees fit.

        (2) The MVDDS applicant shall certify as an exhibit to its short form application that it and all parties to the application will come into compliance with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (3) If such MVDDS applicant is a successful bidder in an auction, it must submit with its long-form application a signed statement describing its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the eligibility restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (4) If such an MVDDS applicant is otherwise qualified, its application will be granted subject to a condition that the applicant shall come into compliance with the eligibility restrictions in paragraph (a) within ninety (90) days of final grant of such MVDDS license.

        (5) An MVDDS applicant will be considered to have come into compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if:

        (i) In the case of the divestiture of a portion of an MVDDS license service area, it has successfully completed the assignment or transfer of control of the requisite portion of the MVDDS geographic service area.

        (ii) In all other cases, it has submitted to the Commission a signed certification that it has come into compliance with paragraph (a) of this section by the following means, identified in such certification:

        (A) By divestiture of a disqualifying interest in a cable operator, identified in terms of the interest owned, the owner of such interest (and, if such owner is not the applicant itself, the relationship of the owner to the applicant), the name of the party to whom such interest has been divested, and the date such divestiture was executed; or

        (B) By divestiture of the requisite portion of the cable operator's existing service area, identified in terms of the name of the party to whom such interest has been divested, the date such divestiture was executed, the name of any regulatory agency that must approve such divestiture, and the date on which an application was filed for this purpose with the regulatory agency.

        (6) If no such certification or application is tendered to the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial license, the Commission may cancel or rescind the license automatically, shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts presented, shall take any other action it may deem appropriate.

        § 101.1413   License term and construction requirements.

#### § § 101.1413

        (a) The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on the date of the initial authorization grant.

        (b) As a construction requirement, MVDDS licensees must make a showing of substantial service at the end of five years into the license period and ten years into the license period. The substantial service requirement is defined as a service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which might minimally warrant renewal. At the end of five years into the license term and ten years into the license period, the Commission will consider factors such as:

        (1) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus on serving populations outside of areas serviced by other MVDDS licensees;

        (2) Whether the licensee's operations serve populations with limited access to telecommunications services; and

        (3) A demonstration of service to a significant portion of the population or land area of the licensed area.

        (c) The renewal application of an MVDDS licensee is governed by § 1.949 of this chapter.

        § 101.1415   Partitioning and disaggregation.

#### § § 101.1415

        (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to partition licensed geographic areas along county borders (Parishes in Louisiana or Territories in Alaska). Disaggregation will not be permitted by MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. “Partitioning” is the assignment of geographic portions of a license along geopolitical or other boundaries. “Disaggregation” is the assignment of discrete portions or “blocks” of spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee or qualifying entity.

        (b)  (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning shall request from the Commission an authorization for partial assignment of a license pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter.

        (2) MVDDS licensees may apply to the Commission to partition their licensed geographic service areas to eligible entities and are free to partition their licensed spectrum at any time following the grant of a license.

        (3) Any existing frequency coordination agreements shall convey with the assignment of the geographic area or spectrum, and shall remain in effect for the term of the agreement unless new agreements are reached.

        (c)  (1) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application.

        (2) The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).

        (d)  12 GHz licensees that received a bidding credit and partition their licenses to entities not meeting the eligibility standards for such a bidding credit, will be subject to the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in § 1.2111 of this chapter.

        (e)  The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on the date of the initial authorization grant. The license term for a partitioned license area shall be the remainder of the original licensee's license term as provided for in § 101.1413.

        § 101.1417   Annual report.

#### § § 101.1417

        Each MVDDS licensee shall file with the Broadband Division of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the Commission two copies of a report by March 1 of each year for the preceding calendar year. This report must include the following:

        (a) Name and address of licensee;

        (b) Station(s) call letters and primary geographic service area(s); and

        (c) The following statistical information for the licensee's station (and each channel thereof):

        (1) The total number of separate subscribers served during the calendar year;

        (2) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the calendar year to all subscribers;

        (3) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the calendar year involving the transmission of local broadcast signals; and

        (4) A list of each period of time during the calendar year in which the station rendered no service as authorized, if the time period was a consecutive period longer than 48 hours.

        § 101.1421   Coordination of adjacent area MVDDS stations.

#### § § 101.1421

        (a) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are required to develop sharing and protection agreements based on the design and architecture of their systems, in order to ensure that no harmful interference occurs between adjacent geographical area licensees. MVDDS licensees shall:

        (1) Engineer systems to be reasonably compatible with adjacent and co-channel operations in the adjacent areas on all its frequencies; and

        (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve interference and transmission problems that are present on adjacent and co-channel operations in adjacent areas.

        (b) Harmful interference to public safety stations, co-channel MVDDS stations operating in adjacent geographic areas, and stations operating on adjacent channels to MVDDS stations is prohibited. In areas where the DMAs are in close proximity, careful consideration should be given to power requirements and to the location, height, and radiation pattern of the transmitting and receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of potential interference before bringing the matter to the attention of the Commission.

        (c) Licensees shall coordinate their facilities whenever the facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop operational agreements with relevant licensees in the adjacent geographic areas. Incumbent public safety POFS licensee(s) shall retain exclusive rights to its channel(s) within the relevant geographical areas and must be protected in accordance with the procedures in § 101.103. A list of public safety incumbents is attached as Appendix I to the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, Docket 98-206, released May 23, 2002. Please check with the Commission for any updates to that list.

        § 101.1423   Canadian and Mexican coordination.

#### § § 101.1423

        Pursuant to § 2.301 of this chapter, MVDDS systems in the United States within 56 km (35 miles) of the Canadian and Mexican border will be granted conditional licenses, until final international agreements are approved. These systems may not cause harmful interference to stations in Canada or Mexico. MVDDS stations must comply with the procedures outlined under §§ 101.147(p) and 1.928(f)(1) and (f)(2) of this chapter until final international agreements concerning MVDDS are signed. Section 1.928(f) of this chapter states that transmitting antennas can be located as close as five miles (eight kilometers) of the border if they point within a sector of 160 degrees away from the border, and as close as thirty-five miles (fifty-six km) of the border if they point within a sector of 200 degrees toward the border without coordination with Canada. MVDDS licensees shall apply this method near the Canadian and Mexican borders. No stations are allowed within 5 miles of the borders.

        § 101.1425   RF exposure.

#### § § 101.1425

        MVDDS stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band shall ensure compliance with the Commission's radio frequency exposure requirements in § 1.1307(b) of this chapter. An Environmental Assessment may be required if RF radiation from the proposed facilities would, in combination with radiation from other sources, cause RF power density or field strength in an accessible area to exceed the applicable limits specified in § 1.1310 of this chapter.

        § 101.1440   MVDDS protection of DBS.

#### § § 101.1440

        (a) An MVDDS licensee shall not begin operation unless it can ensure that the EPFD from its transmitting antenna at all DBS customers of record locations is below the values listed for the appropriate region in § 101.105(a)(4)(ii). Alternatively, MVDDS licensees may obtain a signed written agreement from DBS customers of record stating that they are aware of and agree to their DBS system receiving MVDDS signal levels in excess of the appropriate EPFD limits specified in § 101.105(a)(4)(ii). DBS customers of record are those who had their DBS receive antennas installed prior to or within the 30 day period after notification to the DBS operator by the MVDDS licensee of the proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna site.

        (b) MVDDS licensees are required to conduct a survey of the area around its proposed transmitting antenna site to determine the location of all DBS customers of record that may potentially be affected by the introduction of its MVDDS service. The MVDDS licensee must assess whether the signal levels from its system, under its deployment plans, would exceed the appropriate EPFD levels in § 101.105(a)(4)(ii) at any DBS customer of record location. Using EPFD calculations, terrain and building structure characteristics, and the survey results, an MVDDS licensee must make a determination of whether its signal level(s) will exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer of record sites. To assist in making this determination, the MVDDS provider can use the EPFD contour model developed by the Commission and described in Appendix J of the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, ET Docket 98-206 or on the OET website at

        (c) If the MVDDS licensee determines that its signal level will exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer site, it shall take whatever steps are necessary, up to and including finding a new transmit site, to ensure that the EPFD limit will not be exceeded at any DBS customer location.

        (d)  (1) At least 90 days prior to the planned date of MVDDS commencement of operations, the MVDDS licensee shall provide the following information to the DBS licensee(s):

        (i) Geographic location (including NAD 83 coordinates) of its proposed station location;

        (ii) Maximum EIRP of each transmitting antenna system;

        (iii) Height above ground level for each transmitting antenna;

        (iv) Antenna type along with main beam azimuth and altitude orientation information, and description of the antenna radiation pattern;

        (v) Description of the proposed service area; and

        (vi) Survey results along with a technical description of how it determined compliance with the appropriate EPFD level at all DBS subscriber locations.

        (2) No later than forty-five days after receipt of the MVDDS system information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS licensee(s) shall provide the MVDDS licensee with a list of only those new DBS customer locations that have been installed in the 30-day period following the MVDDS notification and that the DBS licensee believes may receive harmful interference or where the prescribed EPFD limits may be exceeded. In addition, the DBS licensee(s) could indicate agreement with the MVDDS licensee's technical assessment, or identify DBS customer locations that the MVDDS licensee failed to consider or DBS customer locations where they believe the MVDDS licensee erred in its analysis and could exceed the prescribed EPFD limit.

        (3) Prior to commencement of operation, the MVDDS licensee must take into account any new DBS customers or other relevant information provided by DBS licensees in response to the notification in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (e) Beginning thirty days after the DBS licensees are notified of a potential MVDDS site in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS licensees are responsible for providing information they deem necessary for those entities who install all future DBS receive antennas on its system to take into account the presence of MVDDS operations so that these DBS receive antennas can be located in such a way as to avoid the MVDDS signal. These later installed DBS receive antennas shall have no further rights of complaint against the notified MVDDS transmitting antenna(s).

        (f) In the event of either an increase in the EPFD contour in any direction or a major modification as defined in § 1.929 of this chapter, such as the addition of an antenna, to an MVDDS station, the procedures of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section and rights of complaint begin anew. Exceptions to this are renewal, transfer of control, and assignment of license applications.

        (g)  The MVDDS licensee must satisfy all complaints of interference to DBS customers of record which are received during a one year period after commencement of operation of the transmitting facility. Specifically, the MVDDS licensee must correct interference caused to a DBS customer of record or cease operation if it is demonstrated that the DBS customer is receiving harmful interference from the MVDDS system or that the MVDDS signal exceeds the permitted EPFD level at the DBS customer location.

        § 101.1501   Service areas.

#### § § 101.1501

        The 70/80/90 GHz bands are licensed on the basis of non-exclusive nationwide licenses. There is no limit to the number of non-exclusive nationwide licenses that may be granted for these bands, and these licenses will serve as a prerequisite for registering individual point-to-point links. In the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz bands, nationwide non-exclusive licenses also serve as a blanket license for air-to-air and ship-to-ship operations, and as a prerequisite to register ground-to-air (GTA) stations and to operate associated GTA and air-to-ground (ATG) transmissions; and as a prerequisite to register shore stations and aerostat relay stations and to operate associated ship-to-shore, shore-to-ship, shore-to-aerostat, aerostat-to-ship, and aerostat-to-shore transmissions.

        § 101.1523   Sharing and coordination among non-government licensees and between non-government and government services.

#### § § 101.1523

        (a) Registration of each link in the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, and 92-95 GHz bands will be in the Universal Licensing System until the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announces by public notice the implementation of a third-party database.

        (b) The licensee or applicant shall:

        (1) Complete coordination with Federal Government links according to the coordination standards and procedures adopted in Report and Order, FCC 03-248, and as further detailed in subsequent implementation public notices issued consistent with that order;

        (2) Provide an electronic copy of an interference analysis to the third-party database manager which demonstrates that the potential for harmful interference to or from all previously registered non-government links has been analyzed according to the standards of section 101.105 and generally accepted good engineering practice, and that the proposed non-government link will neither cause harmful interference to, nor receive harmful interference from, any previously registered non-government link; and

        (3) Provide upon request any information related to the interference analysis and the corresponding link. The third-party database managers shall receive and retain the interference analyses electronically and make them available to the public. Protection of individual links against harmful interference from other links shall be granted to first-in-time registered links. Successful completion of coordination via the NTIA automated mechanism shall constitute successful non-Federal Government to Federal Government coordination for that individual link.

        (c) In addition, the following types of non-Federal Government links require the filing with the Commission an FCC Form 601 for each link for the purpose of coordination and registration, in addition to registering each link in the third-party database:

        (1) Facilities requiring the submission of an Environmental Assessment,

        (2) Facilities requiring international coordination, and

        (3) Operation in quiet zones.

        (d) The Commission believes the licensee is in the best position to determine the nature of its operations and whether those operations impact these settings, and is required to submit to a database manager, as part of the registration package, documentation that an FCC Form 601 has been filed.

        (5) Ground stations must operate with a minimum elevation angle of 5 degrees and a maximum elevation angle of 45 degrees.

        (6) Ground stations must be located at least 10 km from any existing Non-Federal FSS earth station or Federal facility listed in table 4 to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, absent a coordination agreement with the FSS operator.

        (7) Ground stations must be located at least 150 km from the specific Federal facilities and not within the areas listed in table 3 to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, absent a coordination agreement with the Federal operator.

        (8) Ground stations must be located at least 10 km from any existing Federal or non-Federal fixed station receiver, absent a coordination agreement with the fixed station operator.

        (9) Air-to-air transmissions are permitted in 81-86 GHz subject to the following limitations;

        (i) EIRP signal levels radiated along a line between the airborne transmitter and the latitude and longitude of the observatories in table 3 to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which must be maintained as the airborne transmitter moves, cannot exceed the levels shown in table 1 to this paragraph (a)(9)(i). Within the range of 150 km and 375 km, the maximum allowable EIRP levels for horizontal distances not listed in table below may be approximated by linear interpolation.

        (ii) A licensee of aeronautical end points in motion must have a capability to target specific areas which can be added to a “block list” as part of a dynamic link management system. If air-to-air transmission within the main beam of the radio astronomy receiver cannot be avoided, air-to-air transmissions within the radio horizon of the radio astronomy site (as specified in table 2 to this paragraph (a)(9)(ii)) should not occur.

        (iii) The list of radio astronomy sites may be periodically updated by the NTIA and the FCC. This rule may be superseded by a coordination agreement between the licensee and NSF, in which case the coordination agreement will specify the technical restrictions.
