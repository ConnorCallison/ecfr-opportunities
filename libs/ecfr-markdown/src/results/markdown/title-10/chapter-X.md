      The Department of Energy hereby prescribes as its official seal, of which judicial notice shall be taken pursuant to section 654 of the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7264, the imprint illustrated below and described as follows:

      (a)(1) The official seal includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt, on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo. It is crested by the white head of an eagle, atop a white rope. Both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency, in gold, appears on a green background. Detailing is in black.

      (2) The colors used in the configuration are dark green, dark blue, gold, black, and white.

      (3) The eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the Nation's increasing demands for energy. The sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands. The rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities. The lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the Nation's challenge in harnessing the forces.

      (4) The color scheme is derived from nature, symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man's existence. The blue field represents air and water, green represents mineral resources and the earth itself, and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme represents the Nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment.

    (b)  Any document that is required to be signed, must be signed by the person filing the document. Any document filed by a duly authorized representative must contain a statement by such person certifying that he is a duly authorized representative. The signature by the filer constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the document and that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the document is well grounded in fact, warranted under existing law, and submitted in good faith and not for any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay. If a document is signed in violation of this section, the OHA may impose the sanctions specified in § 1003.3 and other sanctions determined to be appropriate.

    (c)  A petition must be clearly labeled according to the nature of the action involved both on the petition itself and, where applicable, in the subject line of the email in which the petition is transmitted.

    (d)  A person who files a petition is under a continuing obligation during the proceeding to provide the OHA with any new or newly discovered information that is relevant to that proceeding. Such information includes, but is not limited to, information regarding any other submission that is subsequently filed by that person with any DOE office.

    (e)  A person who files a petition with the OHA must state whether, to the best knowledge of that person, the same or related action as that which is the subject of the petition has been or presently is being considered or investigated by any other DOE office, other federal agency, department, or instrumentality; or by a state or municipal agency or court; or by any law enforcement agency, including, but not limited to, a consideration or investigation in connection with any proceeding described in this part. In addition, the person must state whether contact has been made by the person or one acting on his behalf with any person who is employed by the DOE with regard to the same or a related issue, act, or transaction arising out of the same factual situation; the name of the person contacted; whether the contact was oral or in writing; the nature and substance of the contact; and the date or dates of the contact.

The person must indicate in the original document that it is confidential or contains confidential information and must file a statement specifying the justification for non-disclosure of the information for which confidential treatment is claimed. For example, if the person states that the information comes within the exception codified at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information, such person shall include a statement specifying why such information is privileged or confidential. If the person filing a document does not submit a copy of the document with the confidential information deleted, the OHA may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.

    (2) The OHA will make a determination regarding any claim of confidentiality under criteria specified in 10 CFR 1004.11. Notice of the decision by the OHA to deny such claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond will be given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its public disclosure.

    (2) The OHA may extend the period of time for a petitioner to provide information requested by the OHA upon a showing of good cause by the petitioner. Such extensions will generally be for a period of no more than 30 days, and in no case will the OHA grant an extension that would result in the undue delay of its evaluation of a petition.

    (c) In evaluating a petition, the OHA may consider relevant information from any source, including information received from a third party, provided that the petitioner is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third-party submissions.

    (d) The OHA will complete its evaluation of a petition within 180 days of receipt of the petition. However, the Director may extend the period for the OHA's review for good cause, the reasoning for which must be set forth in the order extending the review period.

    (g) The OHA may conduct a hearing with regard to the petition if, in its discretion, it considers that such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. In deciding whether to conduct a hearing, the OHA may consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the number of persons potentially aggrieved by a petition, the extent to which witness testimony will assist the OHA in developing a complete factual record, and the estimated costs of conducting a hearing at a venue reasonably convenient to all parties.

    § 1003.15   Subpoenas, information requests, oaths, witnesses.

#### § § 1003.15

    (q) The Director will take all necessary steps to regulate the course of testimony and to avoid delay and prevent or restrain contemptuous or obstructionist conduct or language. The OHA may take steps as the circumstances warrant in regard to any instances where any person or attorney refuses to comply with directions or provisions of this section.

    § 1003.16   Dismissal of petitions.

#### § § 1003.16

    The Director may issue a Decision and Order dismissing a petition at any time during the course of a proceeding. The Decision and Order shall state whether the dismissal is with prejudice or without prejudice.

    (b)  The dismissal of a petition without prejudice by the OHA terminates the OHA's review of the petition but does not bar the petitioner from resubmitting the petition provided that the facts or circumstances leading to the dismissal have been resolved. In dismissing a petition without prejudice, the OHA may order that the petitioner may not resubmit the petition, or a substantially similar petition, for a period of time not to exceed 180 days. The OHA may dismiss a petition without prejudice if:

    (1) The petitioner fails to include any of the required elements of a petition set forth in § 1003.11 of this part;

    (2) The petitioner fails to provide notice as required by § 1003.12 of this part;

    (3) The petitioner fails to timely provide documents or information at the request of the OHA pursuant to § 1003.14 or § 1003.15 of this part;

#### § § 1003.17

    (a) The OHA will grant a petition that seeks an adjustment from a DOE rule, regulation or order under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 7194 only if it determines that doing so will alleviate or prevent serious hardship, gross inequity or unfair distribution of burdens.

    (b) Except as provided by program, statute, rule, regulation, or DOE delegation of authority, the OHA will grant any other petition filed under this part upon a showing that the DOE acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in violation of a law, rule, regulation, or delegation with respect to the final disposition of DOE that is the subject of the petition.

    (c) Petitions shall be decided in a manner that is, to the extent possible, consistent with the disposition of previous petitions of the same kind.

    § 1003.18   Decision and Order.

#### § § 1003.18

    (a) Upon consideration of the petition and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the OHA will issue a Decision and Order granting or denying the petition and ordering relief as appropriate. The OHA will serve the Decision and Order on the parties to the proceeding and make it available to the public.

    (b) The Decision and Order will set forth its legal basis and the relevant facts, state whether it is a final agency action of the DOE, and state what further review, if any, is available.

    (c) There is no administrative appeal of a Decision and Order, except as provided by federal statute.

    § 1003.19   Reconsideration.

#### § § 1003.19

    A participant in the proceeding may submit to the OHA a motion for reconsideration of a Decision and Order. The motion for reconsideration must be filed by the 20th day after the OHA makes the Decision and Order available to the public. The motion must include a statement of the grounds on which the movant believes reconsideration is warranted. Such grounds may include, but are not limited to, procedural, legal, or factual errors in the Decision and Order. A motion for reconsideration may be granted if the Director determines the Decision and Order contains an error that materially impacted the outcome of the proceeding.

The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; DOE may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.

    (n)  refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request (see paragraph (c) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure,  doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. _Review_ does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    (o)  includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. The DOE will search for material in the most efficient and least expensive manner in order to minimize cost for both DOE and the requester. For example, DOE will not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. “_Search_” will be distinguished, moreover, from “review” of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.

    (p)  means the Under Secretary; Under Secretary for Science; Administrator, Energy Information Administration; Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration; Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs; Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management; Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy; Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs; Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer; Chief Human Capital Officer; Chief Information Officer; Director, Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy,Director, Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, and Director, Loan Programs Office, Director, Office of Economic Impact and Diversity; Director, Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals; Director, Office of Legacy Management; Director, Office of Management; Director, Office of Public Affairs; Director, Office of Science; General Counsel; Inspector General; and Senior Intelligence Officer.

    (q)  at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi), means any statute that specifically requires a government agency, such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), to set the level of fees for particular types of records, in order to:

    (1) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by conveniently making available government information;

    (2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications and other services which are for their special use so that these costs are not borne by the general taxpaying public;

    (3) Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or

    (4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating government information.

    § 1004.3   Public inspection in an electronic format and policy on contractor records.

#### § § 1004.3

    (a) DOE will maintain, for public inspection in an electronic format, the materials which are required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to be made available for public inspection and copying. An electronic public reading room can be accessed via  and

    (b)  (1) When a contract with DOE provides that any records acquired or generated by the contractor in its performance of the contract shall be the property of the Government, DOE will make available to the public such records that are in the possession of the Government or the contractor, unless the records are exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b).

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, records owned by the Government under contract that contain information or technical data having commercial value as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section or information for which the contractor claims a privilege recognized under Federal or State law shall be made available only when they are in the possession of the Government and not otherwise exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b).

    (3) The policies stated in this paragraph:

    (i) Do not affect or alter contractors' obligations to provide to DOE upon request any records that DOE owns under contract, or DOE's rights under contract to obtain any contractor records and to determine their disposition, including public dissemination; and

    (ii) Will be applied by DOE to maximize public disclosure of records that pertain to concerns about the environment, public health or safety, or employee grievances.

    (4) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, “technical data and information having commercial value” means technical data and related commercial or financial information which is generated or acquired by a contractor and possessed by that contractor, and whose disclosure the contractor certifies to DOE would cause competitive harm to the commercial value or use of the information or data.

    § 1004.4   Elements of a request.

#### § § 1004.4

    (a)  A request for a record of DOE which is not available for public inspection in an electronic format, as described in § 1004.3, shall be: Addressed to the Headquarters or appropriate field FOIA Officer at DOE at a location listed in § 1004.2(h), and both the envelope and the letter shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request;” or submitted via facsimile or electronically, on an appropriate agency Web site. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a request will be considered to be received by DOE for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) and the 20-day response period will start upon actual receipt by the appropriate FOIA Officer, or not later than ten days after receipt by a designated FOIA Officer at any location in § 1004.2(h). Requests delivered after regular business hours are considered received on the next regular business day.

    (b)  A request for access to records must be submitted in writing and must reasonably describe the records requested to enable DOE personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Where possible, specific information regarding dates, titles, file designations, and other information which may help identify the records should be supplied by the requester, including the names and titles of any DOE officers or employees who have been contacted regarding the request prior to the submission of a written request. If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and its location should be identified to aid in locating the documents. If the records are known to be in a particular office of the DOE, the request should identify that office.

    (c)  (1) Must meet reasonably described records requirement. A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific and well-defined category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if DOE personnel can reasonably determine which particular records are sought in the request. The request must enable the DOE to identify and locate the records sought by a process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive of DOE operations. The FOIA Officer may take into consideration problems of search which are associated with the files of an individual office within the Department and determine that a request is not one for reasonably described documents as it pertains to that office.

    (2)  If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the DOE response will specify the reasons why the request failed to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and will invite the requester to confer with knowledgeable DOE personnel in an attempt to restate the request or reduce the request to manageable proportions by reformulation or by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the production of the records. If DOE responds that additional information is needed from the requester to render records reasonably described, any reformulated request submitted by the requester will be treated as an initial request for purposes of calculating the time for DOE response.

    (d)  (1) 5 U.S.C. 552 does not require the compilation or creation of a record for the purpose of satisfying a request for records.

    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552 does not require the DOE to honor a request for a record not yet in existence, even where such a document may be expected to come into existence at a later time.

    (3) If a requested record is known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, or if no such record is known to exist, the requester will be so notified.

    (e)  A request shall include (1) an assurance to pay whatever fees will be assessed in accordance with § 1004.9, (2) an assurance to pay those fees not exceeding some specified dollar amount, or (3) a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. No request will be deemed to have been received until the DOE has received some valid assurance of willingness to bear fees anticipated to be associated with the processing of the request or a specific request of a waiver or reduction of fees.

    (f)  Some of the records in the files of the DOE have been obtained from other Federal agencies or contain information obtained from other Federal agencies.

    (1) Where a document originated in another Federal agency, the Authorizing Official will refer the request to the originating agency and so inform the requester, unless the originator agrees to direct release by DOE.

    (2) Requests for DOE records containing information received from another agency, or records prepared jointly by DOE and other agencies, will be treated as requests for DOE records except that the Authorizing Official will coordinate with the appropriate official of the other agency. The notice of determination to the requester, in the event part or all of the record is recommended for denial by the other agency, will cite the other agency Denying Official as well as the appropriate DOE Denying Official if a denial by DOE is also involved.

    § 1004.5   Processing requests for records.

#### § § 1004.5

    (a) FOIA Officers will be responsible for processing requests for records submitted pursuant to this part. Upon receiving such a request, the FOIA Officer will, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, ascertain which Authorizing Official has responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the records requested. The FOIA Officer will review the request, consulting with the Authorizing Official where appropriate, to determine its compliance with § 1004.4. Where a request complies with § 1004.4, the FOIA Officer will acknowledge receipt of the request to the requester and forward the request to the Authorizing Official for action.

    (b) The Authorizing Official will promptly identify and review the records encompassed by the request. The Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will prepare a written response—

    (1) Granting the request;

    (2) Denying the request;

    (3) Granting/denying it in part;

    (4) Replying with a response stating that the request has been referred to another agency under § 1004.4(f) or § 1004.6(e); or

    (5) Informing the requester that responsive records cannot be located or do not exist. The written response shall also notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the DOE FOIA Public Liaison(s) or the Office of Government Information Services.

    (c) Where a request involves records that are in the custody of or are the concern of more than one Authorizing Official, the FOIA Officer will identify all concerned Authorizing Officials that can reasonably be expected to have custody of the requested records. Upon identification of the appropriate Authorizing Officials, the FOIA Officer will forward them a copy of the request and a request for action. The Authorizing Officials will prepare a DOE response to the requester consistent with paragraph (b) of this section. The response will identify the Authorizing Official having responsibility for the determination to release or deny records.

    (d)  (1) Action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will be taken within 20 days of a request for DOE records being received (“received” is defined in § 1004.4(a)), except that,

    (i) One request can be made to the requester for information and the DOE can toll the 20-day response period while it waits for the requester's response;

    (ii) If necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment and the DOE can toll the 20-day response period; or

    (iii) If unusual circumstances require an extension of time before a decision on a request can be reached and the person requesting records is promptly informed in writing by the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer of the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched, then the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer may take an extension not to exceed ten days. In cases where the Authorizing Official determines that unusual circumstances exist, the requester shall be notified in writing of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the DOE FOIA Public Liaison(s) or the Office of Government Information Services.

    (2) For purposes of this section and § 1004.8(d), the term “unusual circumstances” may include but is not limited to the following:

    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the offices processing the request;

    (ii) The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are responsive to a single request; or

    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the Department having substantial subject matter interest therein.

    (3) The requester must be promptly notified in writing of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and the date on which a determination is expected to be made.

    (4) If no determination has been made at the end of the 20-day period, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his administrative remedies to have been exhausted, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be made within the applicable time limit, the responsible Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will nevertheless continue to process the request. If DOE is unable to provide a response within the statutory period, the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will inform the requester of the reason for the delay; the date on which a determination may be expected to be made; and the requester's right to seek remedy through the courts, but will ask the requester to forego such action until a determination is made.

    (5) Nothing in this part shall preclude the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer and a requester from agreeing to an extension of time for the initial determination on a request. Any such agreement will be confirmed in writing and will clearly specify the total time agreed upon.

    (6) Expedited processing. Generally, the DOE will respond to requests in the order of receipt. Requests will be processed out of order and processed as soon as practicable when it is determined, based upon information supplied by the requester or otherwise known to the DOE, that a compelling need exists to provide the records in an expeditious manner. The FOIA states that a compelling need exists when failure to obtain records expeditiously could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or, when a request is submitted by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity.

    (7) A determination to grant or deny a request for expedited processing will be made by the appropriate FOIA Officer within ten days after receipt of the request. The requester will be notified of the determination and informed that any denial may be appealed within 90 calendar days to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    § 1004.6   Requests for classified records.

#### § § 1004.6

    (a) All requests for classified records will be subject to the provisions of this part with the special qualifications noted below.

    (b) All requests for records made in accordance with this part, except those requests for access to classified records which are made specifically pursuant to the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 13526 and § 1045 or any successor thereto, may be automatically considered a FOIA Act request.

    (c) Concurrence of the Director of Classification is required on all responses involving the denial of classified information. The Director of Classification will be informed of the request by either the FOIA Officer or the Authorizing Official to whom the action is assigned, and will advise the office originating the records, or having responsibility for the records, and consult with such office or offices prior to making a determination under this section.

    (d) The written notice of a determination to deny records, or portions of records, which contain both classified material and other exempt material, will be concurred in by the Director of Classification who will be the Denying Official for the classified portion of such records in accordance with §§ 1004.5(c) and 1004.7(b)(2). If other DOE officials or appropriate officials of other agencies are responsible for denying any portion of the record, their names and titles or positions will be listed in the notice of denial in accordance with §§ 1004.5(c) and 1004.7(b)(2) and it will be clearly indicated what portion or portions they were responsible for denying.

    (e) Requests for DOE records containing classified information received from another agency, and requests for classified documents originating in another agency, will be coordinated with or referred to the other agency consistent with the provisions of § 1004.4(f). Coordination or referral of information or documents subject to this section will be effected by the Director of Classification (in consultation with the Authorizing Official) with the appropriate official of the other agency.

    § 1004.7   Responses by authorizing officials: Form and content.

#### § § 1004.7

    (a)  Records requested pursuant to § 1004.4 will be made available promptly, when they are identified and determined to be nonexempt under this Regulation, the FOIA, and where the applicable fees are $15 or less or where it has been determined that the payment of applicable fees should be waived. Where the applicable fees exceed $15, the records may be made available before all charges are paid.

    (b)  A reply denying a request for a record will be in writing. It will be signed by a FOIA Officer or the Denying Official pursuant to § 1004.5 (b) or (c) and will include:

    (1)  A statement of the reason for denial, containing a reference to the specific exemption under the FOIA authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld, and a statement of why a discretionary release is not appropriate. The amount of information deleted and the applicable exemption will be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.

    (2)  A statement setting forth the name and the title or position of each Denying Official and identifying the portion of the denial for which each Denying Official is responsible.

    (3)  A statement or notation addressing the issue of whether there is any segregable nonexempt material in the documents or portions thereof identified as being denied.

    (4)  Although a determination that no such record is known to exist is not a denial, the requester will be informed that a challenge may be made to the adequacy of the search by appealing within 90 calendar days to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    (5)  A statement that the determination to deny documents made within the statutory time period may be appealed within 90 calendar days to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

> [53 FR 15661, May 3, 1988, as amended at 79 FR 22858, Apr. 25, 2014; 81 FR 94920, Dec. 27, 2016]

    § 1004.8   Appeal of initial denials.

#### § § 1004.8

    (a)  When the Authorizing or Denying Official or FOIA Officer has denied a request for records in whole or in part or has responded that there are no documents responsive to the request consistent with § 1004.4(d), or when the FOIA Officer has denied a request for expedited processing consistent with § 1004.5(d) or for waiver of fees consistent with § 1004.9, the requester may, within 90 calendar days of its receipt, appeal the determination to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    (b)  The appeal must be in writing, addressed to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585-1615 and both the envelope and letter must be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” The appeal may be delivered by U.S Mail, commercial delivery service, or by electronic mail to  The appeal must contain a concise statement of the grounds upon which it is brought and a description of the relief sought. It should also include a discussion of all relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE (and predecessor agencies) rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeals, and any judicial determinations being relied upon to support the appeal. A copy of the letter containing the determination which is being appealed must be submitted with the appeal. The appeal should also provide a telephone number, electronic mail address, or other means for communicating with the requester during business hours.

    (c)  An appeal will be considered to be received for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) upon receipt by the Appeal Authority. Documents delivered after the regular business hours of the Office of Hearings and Appeals are considered received on the next regular business day.

    (d)  (1) The Appeal Authority will act upon the appeal within 20 days of its receipt, except that if unusual circumstances (as defined in § 1004.5(d)(2)) require an extension of time before a decision on a request can be reached, the Appeal Authority may extend the time for final action for an additional ten days less the number of days of any statutory extension which may have been taken by the Authorizing Official during the period of initial determination.

    (2) The requester must be promptly notified in writing of the extension, setting forth the reasons for the extension, and the date on which a determination is expected to be issued. Notification will be sent by electronic mail, when possible, or by letter.

    (3) If no determination on the appeal has been issued at the end of the 20-day period or the last extension thereof, the requester may consider his administrative remedies to be exhausted and seek a review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be issued within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless continue to be processed; on expiration of the time limit the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be issued, and of his right to seek judicial review in the United States district court in the district in which he resides or has his principal place of business, the district in which the records are situated, or the District of Columbia. The requester may be asked to forego judicial review until determination of the appeal.

    (4) Nothing in this part will preclude the Appeal Authority and a requester from agreeing to an extension of time for the decision on an appeal. Any such agreement will be confirmed in writing by the Appeal Authority and will clearly specify the total time agreed upon for the appeal decision.

    (e)  The Appeal Authority's action on an appeal will be in writing and will set forth the reason for the decision. It will also contain a statement that it constitutes final agency action on the request and that judicial review will be available either in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, the district in which the records are situated, or in the District of Columbia. Documents determined by the Appeal Authority to be documents subject to release will be made promptly available to the requester upon payment of any applicable fees.

    (f)  The Secretary of Energy or his or her designee will make the final determination concerning appeals involving the denial of requests for classified information or the denial of requests for information falling within the scope of section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2168).

    (g)  Any appeal of the determination to deny a request for expedited processing will be acted on expeditiously.”

> [53 FR 15661, May 3, 1988, as amended at 79 FR 22858, Apr. 25, 2014; 81 FR 94920, Dec. 27, 2016]

    § 1004.9   Fees for providing records.

#### § § 1004.9

    (a)  DOE may charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs incurred. DOE will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under FOIA. DOE may contract with private sector services to locate, reproduce and disseminate records in response to FOIA requests when that is the most efficient and least costly method. When doing so, however, DOE will ensure that the ultimate cost to the requester is no greater than it would be if DOE itself had performed these tasks. In no case will DOE contract out responsibilities which FOIA provides that only the agency may discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption, or determining whether to waive or reduce fees, which are determinations by Authorizing Officials or FOIA Officers. Where DOE can identify documents that are responsive to a request and are maintained for public distribution by other agencies such as the National Technical Information Service and the Government Publishing Office, the FOIA Officer will inform requesters of the procedures to obtain records from those sources.

    (1)  Whenever feasible, the DOE will charge for manual searches for records at the salary rate(s) (i.e. basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search.

    (2)  DOE will charge at the actual direct cost of providing the service.

    (3)  The DOE will charge requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges will be assessed only for the initial review (i.e., the review undertaken the first time the DOE analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. The DOE will not charge for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review would be properly assessable.

    (4)  The DOE will make a per-page charge for paper copy reproduction of documents. At present, the charge for paper to paper copies will be ten cents per page and the charge for microform to paper copies will be ten cents per page. For computer generated copies, such as tapes or printouts, the DOE will charge the actual cost, including operator time, for production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, we will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s).

    (5)  It shall be noted that complying with requests for special services such as those listed below is entirely at the discretion of this agency. Neither the FOIA nor its fee structure cover these kinds of services. The DOE will recover the full direct costs of providing services such as those enumerated below to the extent that we elect to provide them:

    (i) Certifying that records are true copies;

    (ii) Sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc.

    (6)  (i) With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iv), DOE will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. Moreover, DOE will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. These provisions work together, so that except for commercial use requesters, DOE will not begin to assess fees until after the Department has provided the free search and reproduction. For example, if a request involves two hours and ten minutes of search time and results in 105 pages of documents, DOE will charge for only ten minutes of search time and only five pages of reproduction. If this cost is equal to or less than $15.00, the amount DOE incurs to process a fee collection, no charges would be assessed. For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word “pages” refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will be normally be “8  × 11” or “11 × 14.” Thus, requesters would not be entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 pages of computer printout, however, might meet the terms of the restriction. Similarly, the term “search time” is based on a  To apply this term, DOE will calculate the hourly rates of the subject matter expert and/or FOIA analysts conducting the search plus 16 percent.

    (ii) When unusual or exceptional circumstances do not apply and time limits specified in FOIA are not met, DOE will not charge any search fees, or duplication fees for educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters and requesters who are representatives of the news media.

    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, DOE will not assess any search fees (or in the case of a requester who is an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative of the news media, duplication fees) under this paragraph (a)(6)(iii) if DOE has failed to comply with any time limit under § 1004.5(d).

    (iv)(A) If DOE has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined in § 1004.5(d)(2)) and DOE provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1004.5(d)(1)(iii), a failure described in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section is excused for an additional 10 days. If DOE fails to comply with the extended time limit, DOE may not assess any search fees (or in the case of a requester described under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section, duplication fees).

    (B) If DOE has determined that unusual circumstances (as that term is defined in § 1004.5(d)(2)) apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, DOE may charge search fees (or in the case of a requester described under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section, duplication fees) if DOE has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1004.5(d)(1)(iii) and DOE has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

    (C) If a court has determined that unusual circumstances exist (as that term is defined in § 1004.5(d)(2)), a failure described in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this of this section shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

    (7)  If the DOE determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section may amount to more than $25.00, the requester will be informed of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has previously indicated a willingness to pay the amount estimated by the agency. In cases where a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to more than $25.00, the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice to a requester pursuant to this paragraph will offer the opportunity to confer with DOE personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.

    (8)  DOE will furnish documents without charge or at reduced charges if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. This fee waiver standard thus sets forth two basic requirements, both of which must be satisfied before fees will be waived or reduced. First it must be established that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Second, it must be established that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. When these requirements are satisfied, based upon information supplied by a requester or otherwise made known to DOE, the waiver or reduction of a FOIA fee will be granted. In determining when fees should be waived or reduced the appropriate FOIA Officer should address the following two criteria:

    (i) That disclosure of the information “is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.” Factors to be considered in applying this criteria include but are not limited to:

    (A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government”;

    (B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;

    (C) The contribution to an understanding by the general public of the subject likely to result from disclosure; and

    (D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities.

    (ii) If disclosure of the information “is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” Factors to be considered in applying this criteria include but are not limited to:

    (A) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so

    (B) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”

    (b)  There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The FOIA Officers will make determinations regarding categories of requesters as defined at § 1004.2. The Headquarters FOIA Officers will assist field FOIA Officers in categorizing requesters, and will resolve conflicting categorizations. FOIA prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories:

    (1)  When DOE receives a request for documents which appears to be for commercial use, charges will be assessed to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. DOE will recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records.

    (2)  The DOE will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.

    (3)  The DOE will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in § 1004.2(m), and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. With respect to this class of requesters, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be a request for a commercial use.

    (4)  The DOE will charge requesters who do not fall into any of the above categories fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests from individuals for records about themselves filed in DOE systems of records will continue to be processed under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.

    (5)  Interest will be charged to those requesters who fail to pay fees. DOE will begin to assess interest charges on the amount billed on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the billing was sent to the requester. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the date of the billing.

    (6)  DOE may assess charges for time spent searching even if the search fails to identify responsive records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If DOE estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel in order to reformulate the request to reduce the cost of the request.

    (7)  A requester may not file multiple requests each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely to avoid payment of fees. When the DOE reasonably believes that a requester or, a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the DOE will aggregate any such requests and charge the appropriate fees. The DOE may consider the time period in which the requests have been made in its determination to aggregate the related requests. In no case will DOE aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.

    (8)  Requesters are not required to make an advance payment (i.e., payment before action is commenced or continued on a request) unless:

    (i) The DOE estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00. In such cases, the DOE will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain a satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment.

    (ii)(A) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion ( within 30 calendar days of the date of the billing). DOE will require the requester to pay the full amount delinquent plus any applicable interest as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the delinquent fee; and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated current fee before we begin to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.

    (B) When DOE acts under paragraphs (b)(8) (i) or (ii) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in section (a)(6) of FOIA ( 20 days from receipt of initial requests and 20 days from receipt of appeals from initial denials, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after DOE has received fee payments described.

    (c)  The DOE will use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment of fees.

    § 1004.10   Exemptions.

#### § § 1004.10

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 552 exempts from all of its publication and disclosure requirements nine categories of records which are described in paragraph (b) of that section. These categories include such matters as national defense and foreign policy information; investigatory records; internal procedures and communications; materials exempted from disclosure by other statutes; confidential, commercial, and financial information; and matters involving personal privacy.

    (b) Specifically, the exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) will be applied consistent with § 1004.1 of these regulations to matters that are:

    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;

    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute-

    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue;

    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; for example Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 ) are covered by this exemption; or

    (iii) If enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to Exemption 3 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).

    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information (i) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (iv) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source, (v) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or (vi) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

    (c) DOE shall withhold information under this section only if—

    (1) The agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in paragraph (b) of this section; or

    (2) Disclosure is prohibited by law. DOE shall consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible and take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this paragraph requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law, or otherwise exempted from disclosure by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

> [53 FR 15661, May 3, 1988, as amended at 79 FR 22859, Apr. 25, 2014; 81 FR 94922, Dec. 27, 2016]

    § 1004.11   Handling information of a private business, foreign government, or an international organization.

#### § § 1004.11

    (a) Whenever a document submitted to DOE contains information which may be exempt from public disclosure, it will be handled in accordance with the procedures in this section. While DOE is responsible for making the final determination with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of information contained in requested documents, DOE will consider the submitter's views (as that term is defined in this section) in making its determination. Nothing in this section will preclude the submission of a submitter's views at the time of the submission of the document to which the views relate, or at any other time.

    (b) When the DOE may determine, in the course of responding to a FOIA request, not to release information submitted to the DOE (as described in paragraph (a) of this section, and contained in a requested document) without seeking any or further submitter's views, no notice will be given the submitter.

    (c) When the DOE, in the course of responding to a FOIA request, cannot make the determination described in paragraph (b) of this section without having for consideration the submitter's views, the submitter shall be promptly notified and provided an opportunity to submit his views on whether information contained in the requested document (1) is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the FOIA Act, (2) contains information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905, or (3) is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure. The DOE will make its own determinations as to whether any information is exempt from disclosure. Notice of a determination by the DOE that a claim of exemption made pursuant to this paragraph is being denied will be given to a person making such a claim no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to intended public disclosure of the information in question. For purposes of this section, notice is deemed to be given when mailed to the submitter at the submitter's last known address.

    (d) When the DOE, in the course of responding to a FOIA request, cannot make the determination described in paragraph (b) of this section and, without recourse to paragraph (c) of this section, previously has received the submitter's views, the DOE will consider such submitter's views and will not be required to obtain additional submitter's views under the procedure described in paragraph (c) of this section. The DOE will make its own determination with regard to any claim that information be exempted from disclosure. Notice of the DOE's determination to deny a claim of exemption made pursuant to this paragraph will be given to a person making such a claim no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to its intended public disclosure.

    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, DOE offices may require a person submitting documents containing information that may be exempt by law from mandatory disclosure to (1) submit copies of each document from which information claimed to be confidential has been deleted or (2) require that the submitter's views be otherwise made known at the time of the submission. Notice of a determination by the DOE that a claim of exemption is being denied will be given to a person making such a claim no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to intended public disclosure of the information in question. For purposes of this section, notice is deemed to be given when mailed to the submitter at the submitter's last known address.

    (f)  Subject to subsequent decisions of the Appeal Authority, criteria to be applied in determining whether information is exempt from mandatory disclosure pursuant to Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act include:

    (1) Whether the information has been held in confidence by the person to whom it pertains;

    (2) Whether the information is of a type customarily held in confidence by the person to whom it pertains and whether there is a reasonable basis therefore;

    (3) Whether the information was transmitted to and received by the Department in confidence;

    (4) Whether the information is available in public sources;

    (5) Whether disclosure of the information is likely to impair the Government's ability to obtain similar information in the future; and

    (6) Whether disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.

    (g) When DOE, in the course of responding to a Freedom of Information Act request, determines that information exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act is to be released in accordance with § 1004.1, DOE will notify the submitter of the intended discretionary release no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the intended public disclosure of the information in question.

    (h) As used in this section, the term  means, with regard to a document submitted to the DOE, an item-by-item indication, with accompanying explanation, addressing whether the submitter considers the information contained in the document to be exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, to be information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905, or to be otherwise exempt by law from mandatory public disclosure. The accompanying explanation shall specify the justification for nondisclosure of any information under consideration. If the submitter states that the information comes within the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information, the submitter shall include a statement specifying why such information is privileged or confidential and, where appropriate, shall address the criteria in paragraph (f) of this section excluding paragraph (f)(5). In all cases, the submitter shall address the question of whether or not discretionary disclosure would be in the public interest.

    § 1004.12   Computation of time.

#### § § 1004.12

    Except as otherwise noted, in computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, the day of the event from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included; the last day of the period so computed is to be included; and Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excepted.

    § 1004.13   Critical electric infrastructure information.

#### § § 1004.13

    (a)  Information regarding critical electric infrastructure information (CEII) filing procedures and further guidance for submitters and requesters is available on the website of the United States Department of Energy's Office of Electricity at

    (b)  This part sets forth the regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE) that implement section 215A(d) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), codified at 16 U.S.C. 824o-1(d). The regulations in this part set forth the DOE procedures for the designation, sharing, and protection of CEII. This section applies to anyone who provides CEII to DOE or who receives CEII from DOE, including DOE employees, DOE contractors, and agents of DOE or of other Federal agencies, as well as individuals or organizations providing CEII or submitting a request for CEII designation to DOE or who have requested or have been permitted access to CEII by DOE.

    (c) —(1)  means the facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network (and any portion thereof), and electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission system reliability. The term does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy.

    (2)  means commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and that is provided to the government as part of a claimed CEII submission.

    (3)  means a system or asset of the bulk-power system, whether physical or virtual, the incapacity or destruction of which would negatively affect national security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of such matters.

    (4)  is defined at FPA section 215(a)(3), with designation criteria codified at 18 CFR 388.113(c). CEII means information related to critical electric infrastructure, or proposed critical electrical infrastructure, generated by or provided to FERC or another Federal agency, other than classified national security information, that is designated as CEII by FERC or the Secretary pursuant to section 215A(d) of the FPA. Such term includes information that qualifies as critical energy infrastructure information under FERC's regulations.

    (5)  means the Assistant Secretary or Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the DOE Office of Electricity, who shall coordinate and oversee the implementation of DOE's program for CEII-designation authority under section 215A of the FPA, assist all DOE Offices with respect to requests for CEII designation in determining whether particular information fits within the definition of CEII, and manage DOE's protection, storage, and sharing of CEII materials and oversight of the development of CEII international sharing protocols. The _CEII Coordinator_ may delegate the daily implementation of the CEII Coordinator function as described in this rule, in whole or in part, to an appropriate DOE Office of Electricity official, to an Assistant Secretary in DOE, and to the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, the Energy Information Administration, the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, or the Western Area Power Administration (“Coordinator's designee”).

    (6)  means the United States _Department_ of Energy.

    (7)  means all organizational entities that are part of the Executive Department created by Title II of the DOE Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91, 91 Stat. 565, 42 U.S.C. 7101 ). For purposes of this Part, the definition of DOE specifically excludes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has promulgated its own CEII procedures at 18 CFR 388.113.

    (8)  means any administrative or operating unit of DOE with authority at or above the level of Assistant Secretary, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, or Administrator.

    (9)  means the _Secretary_ of Energy.

    (d)  The Secretary has the authority to designate information as CEII, in accordance with FPA section 215A. The Secretary may delegate the authority to designate information as CEII to any DOE Office.

    (e)  The DOE CEII Coordinator shall be the primary point of contact for the submission of all requests for designation of information as CEII by DOE, as well as for requests made to DOE by organizations or individuals for information that may be protected, in whole or in part, as CEII.

    (1) The CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee shall:

    (i) Receive and review all incoming requests for CEII as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;

    (ii) Make initial determinations as to whether particular information fits within the definition of CEII found in paragraph (c) of this section;

    (iii) Assist any DOE Offices with delegated CEII designation authority to make determinations as to whether a particular requester's need for and ability and willingness to protect CEII warrants limited disclosure of the information to the requester;

    (iv) Establish reasonable conditions for considering requests for release of CEII-designated material in accordance with paragraphs (g)(5) and (6) of this section;

    (v) Make the Department's final determination regarding a request by any non-federal entity (organization or individual) for CEII-designated materials, in consultation with the appropriate DOE Office(s);

    (vi) Notify a CEII submitter of a request for such information by a non-federal entity;

    (vii) Convene a conference call between an affected DOE Office and a CEII submitter to discuss concerns related to a non-federal entity requesting release of CEII within no more than five (5) business days after the CEII submitter is notified of the request, providing the CEII submitter with a copy of the request prior to the conference call; and

    (viii) Perform oversight of the DOE CEII program and establish guidance for the treatment, handling, and storage of all CEII materials in the Department in accordance with paragraph (g)(6) of this section, including those related to CEII international sharing protocols.

    (2) DOE Offices with delegated authority to designate CEII in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, as well as any CEII Coordinator designee(s), will meet regularly, at the discretion of the CEII Coordinator, but not less than once per year, to ensure coordinated implementation of DOE's CEII designation authority.

    (3) DOE, at the discretion of the CEII Coordinator, shall meet with representatives from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission semi-annually (or more often, as necessary) to ensure that both agencies are applying CEII designation criteria consistently and to share best practices.

    (4) DOE, at the discretion of the CEII Coordinator, shall meet at least once per year with representatives from the Department of Commerce including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other Federal agencies, as needed, to ensure shared understanding and consistent communication among Federal agencies that collect, maintain, and potentially release information that DOE may consider designating as CEII as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.

    (f)  All information designated by DOE as CEII is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) and shall not be made available by any Federal, state, political subdivision, or tribal authority pursuant to any Federal, State, political subdivision, or tribal law requiring public disclosure of information or records pursuant to section 215A(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Federal Power Act.

    (g) —(1)  The CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee shall apply the definition of CEII as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, consistent with FPA section 215A(a)(3), and with designation criteria codified at 18 CFR 388.113(c), to information sought by DOE and to information submitted to DOE with a request for designation.

    (2)  Any person or entity requesting that information submitted to DOE be designated as CEII must submit such request to the DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee according to the following procedures:

    (i) The submitter must clearly label the cover page and pages or portions of the information for which CEII treatment is requested in bold, capital lettering, indicating that it contains CEII, as appropriate, and marked “CEII—CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE.”

    (ii) The submitter must clearly label the cover page and pages or portions of information that it considers Confidential Business Information in bold, capital lettering, indicating that it contains Confidential Business Information, as appropriate, and marked “CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE.” If combined with a CEII label, the information should be marked “CEII—CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION and CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE.”

    (iii) The submitter must also clearly indicate the DOE Office(s) from which the CEII designation is being requested in bold, capital lettering on the cover page.

    (iv) The submitter must also segregate those portions of the information that contain CEII (or information that reasonably could be expected to lead to the disclosure of the CEII) wherever feasible.

    (v) The submitter must also label and segregate information that it classifies as Confidential Business Information under the definition at paragraph (c)(2) of this section with the mark “CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE.” Under separate cover, the submitter may, but is not required to, submit a written justification of why the labeled information meets the definition at paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (vi) The submitter must submit a public version of the information where information designated CEII and information for which CEII designation is requested is redacted or otherwise protected through extraction from the non-CEII to the DOE CEII Coordinator and the Coordinator's designee in an appropriate DOE Office, where feasible. If the entirety of submitted information is CEII, the submitter must indicate that, but no separate public version is required.

    (3)  Any DOE employees, DOE contractors, or agents of DOE requesting that information generated by the Department be designated as CEII must submit such request to the DOE CEII Coordinator or the Coordinator's designee in an appropriate DOE Office according to the following procedures:

    (i) The submitter must clearly label the cover page and pages or portions of the information for which CEII treatment is requested in bold, capital lettering, indicating that it contains CEII, as appropriate, and marked “CEII—CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE.”

    (ii) The submitter must also segregate those portions of the information that contain CEII (or information that reasonably could be expected to lead to the disclosure of the CEII) wherever feasible.

    (iii) The submitter must submit a public version of the information where information designated CEII and information for which CEII designation is requested is redacted or otherwise protected through extraction from non-CEII.

    (iv) CEII designation for information generated by DOE, to include all organizational entities that are a part of the Executive Department created by Title II of the DOE Organization Act, may be executed at any time, regardless of when such information was generated, where feasible.

    (4)  (i) Upon receiving a request for CEII designation of information submitted to DOE, the DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee shall review the submission made in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

    (ii) Information for which CEII treatment is requested will be maintained by the CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee in DOE's files as non-public unless and until DOE completes its determination that the information is not entitled to CEII treatment. This approach does not mean that DOE has made a determination regarding CEII designation, and should under no circumstances be construed as such. DOE will endeavor to make a determination as soon as practicable. The Department retains the right to make determinations about any request for CEII designation at any time, including the removal of a previously granted CEII designation. At such time that a determination is made that information does not meet the CEII criteria, DOE will follow the procedures for return of information not designated as CEII outlined in paragraph (g)(6)(iii) of this section.

    (iii) When a requester seeks information for which CEII status has been requested but not designated, or when DOE itself is considering release of such information, DOE will render a decision on designation before responding to the requester or releasing such information. Subsequently, the release of information will be treated in accordance with the procedures established for CEII-designated material, or the return of information not designated as CEII.

    (5)  (i) The DOE CEII Coordinator, or a Coordinator's designee, will execute the Department's evaluation as to whether the submitted information or portions of the information meets the definition of CEII, as described at paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with the appropriate DOE Office with delegated CEII designation authority. The DOE Office will designate submitted information as soon as practicable and will inform submitters of the designation date if requested at the time of submission.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (6)  (i)  The Secretary or delegated DOE Office will make a determination regarding CEII designation after considering the information against the criteria for CEII designation. The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee shall promptly communicate the decision of the Secretary or delegated DOE Office to the submitter.

    (ii)  DOE reserves the right to review at any time information designated by DOE as CEII to determine whether the information is properly designated. The designation of information as CEII, or the removal of such designation, must be reviewed when:

    (A) A FOIA request is submitted for the information under § 1004.10; or

    (B) A request is made for reconsideration of the designation or removal of the designation under paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

    (iii)  Because the submitter voluntarily provided the information to DOE, at the request of the submitter, DOE will return or destroy information for which CEII designation was requested but not granted, and will attempt to remove all copies of such information from DOE files, both physical and electronic. DOE shall return or destroy non-CEII consistent with the Federal Records Act, and DOE handling of agency records in accordance with DOE Order O.243.1A, Records Management Program, and related requirements and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining an efficient and economic records management program in accordance with law and regulatory requirements. DOE shall not remove electronic files in the ordinary course of business. If a submitter is required to provide information and DOE denies CEII designation, the submitter may file a request for review under the procedures.

    (7) —(i)  All information designated by DOE as CEII, whether submitted to or generated by DOE, shall be clearly labeled as such, and shall include the date on which the information was designated as CEII. For information that meets the definition of CEII but cannot be physically labeled, such as electronic information, the information shall be—

    (A) Electronically marked with the words “CEII—CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE” in the electronic file name; or

    (B) Transmitted under a Non-Disclosure Agreement or other agreements or arrangements, such as those identified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, to an electronic system where such information is stored in a secure electronic environment that identifies the stored information as CEII.

    (ii)  All information designated by DOE as CEII is exempt from FOIA and shall not be made available as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

    (iii)  DOE will store information for which CEII treatment is requested in a secure place in a manner that would prevent unauthorized access ( locked room or file cabinet). Information submitted to DOE in electronic format shall be stored in a secure electronic environment that identifies the stored information as CEII.

    (8) — DOE will evaluate information claimed as Confidential Business Information if, and at such time as, a valid FOIA request is submitted and the information is otherwise responsive to the request. DOE will conduct the evaluation pursuant to procedures set forth in this part. In its evaluation, DOE will consult any supplementary justification provided by the submitter as described at paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.

    (h)  Designation of information as CEII shall be a five-year period, unless removed or re-designated.

    (1)  (i) The Secretary or delegated DOE Office will determine the duration of designation at the time of designation.

    (ii) A submitter may re-apply for CEII designation no earlier than one year prior to the date of expiration of the initial designation or re-designation in accordance with the application procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

    (iii) The Secretary, the DOE CEII Coordinator, or a Coordinator's designee may initiate CEII designation at any time prior to the date of expiration of the initial designation or re-designation.

    (2)  The designation of information as CEII may be removed at any time, by the Secretary or the DOE CEII Coordinator in consultation with the DOE Office to which the Secretary has delegated the authority, in whole or in part, upon determination that the unauthorized disclosure of such information could no longer be used to impair the security or reliability of the bulk-power system or distribution facilities or any other form of energy infrastructure. If the CEII designation is to be removed, the submitter and the DOE Office that produced or maintains the CEII will receive electronic notice stating that the CEII designation will be removed at least nine (9) business days before disclosure. In such notice, the DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee will provide the submitter and the DOE Office that produced or maintains the CEII an opportunity (at least nine (9) business days) in which to comment in writing prior to the removal of the designation. The final determination will briefly explain DOE's determination.

    (3)  If a FOIA request is received for information for which CEII designation has expired or has been removed, DOE will work with the submitter to review whether the information is subject to other FOIA exemptions. DOE will destroy non-CEII consistent with the Federal Records Act, and DOE handling of agency records in accordance with DOE Order O.243.1A, Records Management Program, and related requirements and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining an efficient and economic records management program in accordance with law and regulatory requirements.

    (i) —(1)  (i) Any person who has submitted information and requested such information to be designated as CEII may request reconsideration of a DOE decision not to designate that information as CEII, or to remove an existing CEII designation, on grounds that the information does not meet the required CEII criteria. Within ten (10) business days of notification by DOE of its CEII decision, the person must file a request for reconsideration. The request must be sent to the DOE CEII Coordinator and Coordinator's designee through a secure electronic submission or by mail according to the instructions at 10 CFR 205.12. The request must also be sent to the DOE Office that made the decision at issue and to DOE's Office of General Counsel in Washington, DC, according to the instructions at 10 CFR 205.12. A statement in support of the request for reconsideration must be submitted within twenty (20) business days of the date of the determination. The request and the supporting statement will be considered submitted upon receipt by the Office of the General Counsel.

    (ii) Any person who has received a decision denying a request for the release of CEII, in whole or in part, or a decision denying a request to change the designation of CEII, may request reconsideration of that decision. A statement in support of the request for reconsideration must be submitted to the DOE Office of the General Counsel within twenty (20) business days of the date of the determination.

    (iii) The Secretary or the DOE Office that made the decision at issue will make a determination, in coordination with the DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee, with respect to any request for reconsideration within twenty (20) business days after the receipt of the request and will notify the person submitting the request of the determination and the availability of judicial review.

    (iv) Before seeking judicial review in Federal District Court under section 215A(d)(11) of the FPA, a person who received a determination from DOE concerning a CEII designation must first request reconsideration of that determination.

    (v) A request for reconsideration triggers a stay of the underlying decision, except in instances where voluntary sharing of the disputed information is necessary for law enforcement purposes, to ensure reliable operation or maintenance of electric or energy infrastructure, to maintain infrastructure security, to address potential threats, or to address an urgent need to disseminate the information quickly due to an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance.

    (j) —(1)  An employee of a Federal entity acting within the scope of his or her Federal employment may obtain CEII directly from DOE without following the procedures outlined in paragraph (k) of this section. DOE will evaluate requests by Federal entities for CEII on a programmatic, fact-specific basis. DOE may share CEII with affected agencies for those agencies to carry out their specific jurisdictional responsibilities, but it may impose additional restrictions on how the information may be used and maintained. To obtain access to CEII, an authorized agency employee must sign an acknowledgement and agreement that states the agency will protect the CEII in the same manner as the Department and will refer any requests for the information to the Department. Notice of each such request also must be given to the CEII Coordinator.

    (2)  The Secretary or the CEII Coordinator shall make a final determination whether to share CEII materials requested by non-federal entities that are within the categories specified in section 215A(d)(2)(D) of the FPA. A request by such a non-federal entity shall not be entertained unless the requesting non-federal entity demonstrates that the release of information is in the national security interest and it has entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement with DOE that ensures, at a minimum:

    (i) Use of the information only for authorized purposes and by authorized recipients and under the conditions prescribed by the Secretary or CEII Coordinator;

    (ii) Protection of the information in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized access;

    (iii) Destruction or return of the information after the intended purposes of receiving the information have been fulfilled;

    (iv) Prevention of viewing or access by individuals or organizations that have been prohibited or restricted by the United States or the Department from viewing or accessing CEII;

    (v) Compliance with the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, subject to DOE audit;

    (vi) No further sharing of the information without DOE's permission; and

    (vii) CEII provided pursuant to the agreement is not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), and shall not be made available by any Federal, state, political subdivision, or tribal authority pursuant to any Federal, State, political subdivision, or tribal law requiring public disclosure of information or records pursuant to sections 215A(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Federal Power Act.

    (viii) The Non-Disclosure Agreement must state that the agreement applies to all subsequent releases of CEII during the calendar year in which the DOE and the non-federal entity enter into the agreement. As a result, the non-federal entity will not be required to file a Non-Disclosure Agreement with subsequent requests during the calendar year.

    (3)  In accordance with section 215A(d)(2)(D) of the FPA, DOE may, taking into account standards of the Electric Reliability Organization, facilitate voluntary sharing of CEII with, between, and by Federal, State, political subdivision, and tribal authorities; the Electric Reliability Organization; regional entities; information sharing and analysis centers or information sharing and analysis organizations; reliability coordinators; balancing authorities; owners, operators, and users of critical electric infrastructure in the United States; and other entities determined appropriate. All entities receiving CEII must execute either a Non-Disclosure Agreement or an Acknowledgement and Agreement or participate in an Electric Reliability Organization or Regional Entity information sharing program that ensures the protection of CEII. A copy of each agreement or program will be maintained by the DOE Office with a copy to the CEII Coordinator or the Coordinator's designee. If DOE facilitates voluntary sharing of CEII under this subsection, DOE may impose additional restrictions on how the information may be used and maintained.

    (4)  The Secretary may delegate authority to DOE Offices to develop, after consultation with Canadian and Mexican authorities, protocols for the voluntary sharing of CEII with Canadian and Mexican authorities and owners, operators, and users of the bulk-power system outside the United States. The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee would provide assistance and advice to DOE Offices in the development of the international sharing protocols.

    (5)  The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee will provide electronic notice to the CEII submitter no less than ten (10) business days before DOE releases CEII submitted to and not generated by DOE, except in instances where voluntary sharing is necessary for law enforcement purposes, to ensure reliable operation or maintenance of electric or energy infrastructure, to maintain infrastructure security, or to address potential threats; where there is an urgent need to quickly disseminate the information; or where prior notice is not practicable due to an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance. If prior notice is not given, DOE will provide notice as soon as practicable. The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee will convene a phone call within five (5) business days of electronic notice with the CEII submitter to discuss concerns about the proposed release of CEII-designated materials to the requester. DOE will make the final determination as to whether to share CEII not generated by DOE.

    (k)  DOE shall consider requests for CEII on a case-by-case basis. Any person requesting CEII must include the following material with the request:

    (1)  Provide your name, title and employer, work address, work phone number, and work email. If you are requesting the information on behalf of a person or entity other than yourself, you must also list that person's or entity's work contact information, including name, title, address, phone number, and email.

    (2)  Provide a detailed statement explaining the particular need for and intended use of the information. This statement must include:

    (i) The extent to which a particular function is dependent upon access to the information;

    (ii) Why the function cannot be achieved or performed without access to the information;

    (iii) An explanation of whether other information is available to the requester that could facilitate the same objective;

    (iv) How long the information will be needed;

    (v) Whether or not the information is needed to participate in a specific proceeding (with that proceeding identified); and

    (vi) An explanation of whether the information is needed expeditiously.

    (3)  Provide an executed Non-Disclosure Acknowledgement (if the requester is a Federal entity) or an executed Non-Disclosure Agreement (if the requester is not a Federal entity) requiring adherence to limitations on the use and disclosure of the information requested.

    (4)  Upon receiving a request for CEII, the CEII Coordinator shall contact the DOE Office or Federal agency that created or maintains the CEII. In consultation with the DOE Office, the CEII Coordinator shall carefully consider the statement of need provided by the requester and determine if the need for CEII and the protection afforded to the CEII should result in sharing CEII for the limited purpose identified in the request. If the CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee denies the request, the requestor may seek reconsideration, as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

    (l) —(1)  If the submitter of information deliberately discloses to the public information that has received a CEII designation, then the Department reserves the right to remove its CEII designation.

    (2)  DOE employees or contractors who knowingly or willfully disclose CEII in an unauthorized manner will be subject to appropriate sanctions, including disciplinary action under DOE or DOE Office personnel rules or referral to the DOE Inspector General. Any action by a Federal or non-federal Entity who knowingly or willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry to obtain CEII may also constitute a violation of other applicable laws and is potentially punishable by fine and imprisonment.

    (3)  In accordance with the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465), the provisions of this rule are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute relating to:

    (i) Classified information;

    (ii) Communications to Congress;

    (iii) The reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or

    (iv) Any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling statutory provisions are not affected by this rule.

#### § § 1008.4

      (a) When a request for information about or for access to or correction of a record pertaining to an individual and contained in a system of records has been made pursuant to § 1008.6, valid identification of the individual making the request shall be required before information will be given, access granted or a correction considered, to insure that information is given, corrected, or records disclosed or corrected only at the request of the proper person.

      (b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an individual making a request may establish his identity by:

      (1) Including with his request, if submitted by mail, a photocopy of two identifying documents bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address and date of birth; or

      (2) Appearing at the appropriate DOE location during the regular business hours and presenting either of the following:

      (i) One identifying document bearing the individual's photograph and signature, such as a driver's license or passport; or

If a response cannot be made within ten working days, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer shall send an interim response providing information on the status of the request, including an estimate of the time within which action is expected to be taken on the request and asking for any further information as may be necessary to respond to the request. Action will be completed as soon as possible, but not later than 20 working days after receipt of the original specific inquiry. In unusual circumstances and for good cause, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer may decide that action cannot be completed within the initial 20 working days. In such case, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer will advise the individual of the reason for the delay and the date (not to exceed an additional 20 working days) by which action can be expected to be completed.

      (c) The term  as used in this section includes situations where a search for requested records from inactive storage is necessary; cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved; instances where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record; and cases where consultation with other agencies which have substantial interest in the response to the request is necessary.

      (d) Upon receiving a request, the Privacy Act Officer shall ascertain which System Manager or Managers of the DOE have primary responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the system or systems of records subject to the request and shall forward the request to such System Manager or Managers. The System Manager or Managers shall promptly identify and, in consultation with the General Counsel, review the records encompassed by the request.

      (e) Where the request is for access to or information about records, after reviewing the material the System Manager or Managers concerned shall transmit to the Privacy Act Officer the requested material. The transmission to the Privacy Act Officer shall include any recommendation that the request be granted or wholly or partially denied and shall set forth any exemption categories supporting denials.

#### § § 1008.8

      (a) Consistent with the recommendation of the System Manager and the concurrence of the appropriate General Counsel, the Privacy Act Officer shall provide to the requesting individual the information about or access to a record or information pertaining to the individual contained in a system of records, unless the request is being denied in accordance with § 1008.9 of this part. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information:

      (1) Whether there is information or a record pertaining to him that is contained in a system of records;

      (2) The methods of access as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section;

      (3) The place at which the record or information may be inspected;

      (4) The earliest date on which the record or information may be inspected and the period of time that the record or information will remain available for inspection. In no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty calendar days from the date of notification.

      (5) An indication that copies of the records are enclosed, or the estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees that would be charged to provide other than the first copy of the record, pursuant to § 1008.13.

      (6) The fact that the individual, if he wishes, may be accompanied by another person during the in-person review of the record or information, provided that the individual shall first furnish to the Privacy Act Officer a written statement authorizing disclosure of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence; and

      (7) Any additional requirements that must be satisfied in order to provide information about or to grant access to the requested record or information.

      (b) The following methods of access to records or information pertaining to an individual and contained in a system of records may be available to that individual depending on the circumstances of a particular request:

      (1) A copy of the record may be enclosed with the initial response in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) Inspection in person may be arranged during the regular business hours of the DOE in the office specified by the Privacy Act Officer;

      (3) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the records or information to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the DOE or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of money or manpower; and

      (4) The requested number of copies in addition to the initial copy may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 1008.13.

      (c) If the Privacy Act Officer believes, based upon a recommendation of the System Manager and the agency's medical officer, that disclosure of medical and/or psychological information directly to an individual could have an adverse effect upon that individual, the individual may be asked:

      (1) To designate in writing a physician or mental health professional to whom he would like the records to be disclosed; or

      (2) To submit a signed statement by his physician or a mental health professional indicating that, in his view, disclosure of the requested records or information directly to the individual will not have an adverse effect upon the individual. If the individual refuses to designate a physician or mental health professional, or to submit a signed statement from his physician or mental health professional as provided in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the request will be considered denied, and the appeal rights provided in § 1008.11 will be available to the individual.

      (d) The Privacy Act Officer shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of an individual's review of his record as is necessary to make the record intelligible to the individual.

      (e) The DOE will, as required by subsection (d)(1), assure an individual's right “to review his or her record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him.” However, original records will be made available to individuals only under the supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his designee. Individuals will be provided at their request with a copy, but not the original, of records pertaining to them.

In such cases the individual shall be advised in writing of the reason for the extension and of the estimated date by which a final determination will be issued. The final determination shall be issued not later than the 30th working day after receipt of the appeal unless unusual circumstances, as defined in § 1008.7, are present, whereupon an additional 30 days may be extended.

      (j) If the appeal of a denial of correction or amendment is denied, the final determination shall state the reasons for the denial and shall be transmitted promptly to the individual, the Privacy Act Officer and the appropriate System Manager.

      (1) The determination also shall include the following:

      (i) Notice of the right of the individual to file with the Privacy Act Officer a concise, signed statement of reasons for disagreeing with the final determination, receipt of which statement will be acknowledged by the Privacy Act Officer.

      (ii) An indication that any disagreement statement filed by the individual will be noted and appended to the disputed record and that a copy of the statement will be provided by the Privacy Act Officer or the System Manager, as appropriate, to persons and agencies to which the record is disclosed subsequent to the date of receipt of such statement;

      (iii) An indication that the DOE shall append to any disagreement statement filed by the individual a copy of the final determination or a summary thereof, which determination or summary also will be provided to persons and agencies to which the disagreement statement is disclosed; and,

      (3) Where an individual files a statement of disagreement consistent with paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the Privacy Act Officer shall take steps to insure that the actions provided in paragraphs (j)(1) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section are taken.

      (4)  (i) Subsection (k)(6) permits exemption of systems of records that include testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service, the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing of examination process.

      (ii) The DOE systems of records listed below have been exempted to the extent they contain testing or examination material in order to protect the integrity of the personnel testing and evaluation process and to avoid providing individuals with unfair advantage, by premature or unfair disclosure of testing or rating information.

    § 1013.31   Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

#### § § 1013.31

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.

    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct ( the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statement) charged in the complaint:

    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;

    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;

    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;

    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;

    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;

    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;

    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;

    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;

    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;

    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;

    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;

    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;

    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and

    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.

    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.

    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 1013.22(a) of this part.

    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

    (f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—

    (1) A party who is an individual;

    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party appearing for the entity  or designated by the party's representative; or

    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1015.100   Scope.

#### § § 1015.100

      This subpart describes the scope of the standards set forth in this part. This subpart corresponds to 31 CFR part 900 in the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 1015.101   Prescription of standards.

#### § § 1015.101

      (a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General of the United States issued regulations in 31 CFR parts 900-904, under the authority contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(d)(2). Those regulations prescribe standards for Federal agency use in the administrative collection, offset, compromise, and the suspension or termination of collection activity for civil claims for money, funds, or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C. 3701(b), unless specific Federal agency statutes or regulations apply to such activities or, as provided for by Title 11 of the United States Code, when the claims involve bankruptcy. The regulations in 31 CFR parts 900-904 also prescribe standards for referring debts to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-129 (Revised), “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,” the Treasury's “Managing Federal Receivables,” and other publications concerning debt collection and debt management. These publications are available from the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Financial Policy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585.

      (b) Additional rules governing centralized administrative offset and the transfer of delinquent debt to Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers for collection (cross-servicing) under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, 1358 (April 26, 1996), are set forth in separate regulations issued by Treasury. Rules governing the use of certain debt collection tools created under the DCIA, such as administrative wage garnishment, also are set forth in separate regulations issued by Treasury. See generally, 31 CFR part 285.

      (c) DOE is not limited to the remedies contained in this part and may use any other authorized remedies, including alternative dispute resolution and arbitration, to collect civil claims, to the extent that such remedies are not inconsistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, Public Law 89-508, 80 Stat. 308 (July 19, 1966), the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 (October 25, 1982), the DCIA or other relevant law. The regulations in this part do not impair DOE's common law rights to collect debts.

      (d) Standards and policies regarding the classification of debt for accounting purposes (for example, write-off of uncollectible debt) are contained in OMB's Circular A-129 (Revised), “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.”

      § 1015.102   Definitions and construction.

#### § § 1015.102

      (a) For the purposes of the standards in this part, the terms “claim” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an agency official to be due the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms “claim” and “debt” include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

      (b) A debt is “delinquent” if it has not been paid by the date specified in DOE's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement), unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.

      (c) In this part, words in the plural form shall include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude matters not listed but do include matters that are in the same general class.

      (d) Recoupment is a special method for adjusting debts arising under the same transaction or occurrence. For example, obligations arising under the same contract generally are subject to recoupment.

      (e) The term “Department of Energy” or “DOE” includes the National Nuclear Security Administration.

      § 1015.103   Antitrust, fraud, tax, interagency, transportation account audit, acquisition contract, and financial assistance instrument claims excluded.

#### § § 1015.103

      (a) The standards in this part relating to compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity do not apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim. Only the DOJ has the authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection activity on such claims. The standards in this part relating to the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent authorized by the DOJ in a particular case. Upon identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, DOE will promptly refer the case to the DOJ for action. At its discretion, the DOJ may return the claim to DOE for further handling in accordance with the standards in this part.

      (b) Part 1015 does not apply to tax debts.

      (c) Part 1015 does not apply to claims between Federal agencies. Federal agencies should attempt to resolve interagency claims by negotiation in accordance with Executive Order 12146 (3 CFR, 1980 Comp., pp. 409-412).

      (d) Part 1015 does not apply to claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 which shall be determined, collected, compromised, terminated, or settled in accordance with regulations published under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 ( 41 CFR parts 101-141, administered by the Director, Office of Transportation Audits, General Services Administration) and are otherwise excepted from these regulations.

      (e)(1) Part 1015 does not apply to claims arising out of acquisition contracts, subcontracts, and purchase orders which are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations System, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR subpart 32.6, and the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR subpart 932.6, and which shall be determined or settled in accordance with those regulations; and

      (2) Part 1015 does not apply to claims arising out of financial assistance instruments ( grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts under cooperative agreements) and loans and loan guarantees, which shall be determined or settled in accordance with 10 CFR 600.26 and 10 CFR 600.112(f).

      § 1015.104   Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other statutes not precluded.

#### § § 1015.104

      Nothing in this part precludes DOE from disposing of any claim under statutes and implementing regulations other than subchapter II of chapter 37 of Title 31 of the United States Code (Claims of the United States Government) and the standards in this part. In such cases, the specifically applicable laws and regulations will generally take precedence over this part.

      § 1015.105   Form of payment.

#### § § 1015.105

      Claims may be paid in the form of money or, when a contractual basis exists, the Government may demand the return of specific property or the performance of specific services.

      § 1015.106   Subdivision of claims not authorized.

#### § § 1015.106

      Debts may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2). A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract shall be considered a single debt in determining whether the debt is one of less than $100,000 (excluding interest, penalties, and administrative costs) or such higher amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of compromise or suspension or termination of collection activity.

      § 1015.107   Required administrative proceedings.

#### § § 1015.107

      DOE is not required to omit, foreclose, or duplicate administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

      § 1015.108   No private rights created.

#### § § 1015.108

      The standards in this part do not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person, nor shall the failure of DOE, Treasury, the DOJ or other agency to comply with any of the provisions of this part be available to any debtor as a defense.

    Subpart B—Standards for the Administrative Collection of Claims

      § 1015.200   Scope.

#### § § 1015.200

      The subpart sets forth the standards for administrative collection of claims under this part. This subpart corresponds to 31 CFR part 901 of the Treasury Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 1015.201   Aggressive agency collection activity.

#### § § 1015.201

      (a) Heads of DOE Headquarters Elements and Field Elements or their designees must promptly notify the appropriate DOE finance office of claims arising from their operations. A claim will be recorded and controlled by the responsible finance office upon receipt of documentation from a competent authority establishing the amount due.

      (b) In accordance with 31 CFR Chapter IX parts 900-904 and this part, DOE will aggressively collect all debts arising out of activities. Collection activities shall be undertaken promptly with follow-up action taken as necessary.

      (c) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), shall be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.

      (d) DOE will cooperate with other agencies in its debt collection activities.

      (e) DOE will refer debts to Treasury as soon as due process requirements are complete, and should refer such debts no later than 180 days after the debt has become delinquent. On behalf of DOE, Treasury will take appropriate action to collect or compromise the referred debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt and action. Appropriate action to collect a debt may include referral to another debt collection center, a private collection contractor, or the DOJ for litigation. (See 31 CFR 285.12, Transfer of Debts to Treasury for Collection.) This requirement does not apply to any debt that:

      (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

      (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;

      (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to Treasury; or

      (4) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent.

      (f) Treasury is authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. DOE will add the fee to the debt as an administrative cost (see § 1015.212(c)).

      § 1015.202   Demand for payment.

#### § § 1015.202

      (a) Written demand as described in paragraph (b) of this section will be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with DOE to resolve the debt. Generally, one demand letter issued 30 days after the initial notice, bill, or written demand should suffice. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this Part, including immediate referral for litigation.

      (b) Demand letters will inform the debtor of:

      (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the rights, if any, the debtor may have to seek review within DOE;

      (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, or administrative costs;

      (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges ( interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced collection, which generally should not be more than 30 days from the date that the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered;

      (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within DOE;

      (5) DOE's intent to refer unpaid debts to Treasury for collection;

      (6) DOE's intent to authorize Treasury to add fees for services rendered as an administrative fee;

      (7) DOE's intent to authorize Treasury to utilize collection tools such as credit bureau reporting, private collection agencies, administrative wage garnishment, Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, litigation, and other tools, as appropriate, to collect the debt;

      (8) DOE's willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment;

      (9) The debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver, depending on applicable statutory authority; and

      (10) DOE's intent to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay such a debt in accordance with DOE regulations or governing procedures.

      (c) DOE will seek to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are dated.

      (d) DOE will seek to respond promptly to communications from debtors, within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.

      (e) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time during or after completion of the demand process, if DOE determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures applicable to offset should be followed (see § 1015.203 of this subpart). The availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset and DOE's determination to pursue collection by offset shall release DOE from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

      (f) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, DOE should advise each person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This notification should comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp, pp. 157-163) and should be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (g) When DOE learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, DOE should immediately seek legal advice from appropriate legal counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless counsel determines that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection activity against the debtor should stop immediately.

      (1) After seeking legal advice, a proof of claim should be filed in most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. DOE will refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.

      (2) If DOE is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.

      (3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, DOE will seek legal advice from counsel to determine whether its payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies available for offset may be frozen until relief from the automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. DOE also will seek legal advice from counsel to determine whether recoupment is available.

      § 1015.203   Collection by administrative offset.

#### § § 1015.203

      (a)  (1) The term “administrative offset” has the meaning provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).

      (2) This section does not apply to:

      (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, ) except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404;

      (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, ) except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);

      (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of the United States;

      (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);

      (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States;

      (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, state law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular types of debts; or

      (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.

      (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

      (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.

      (5) In bankruptcy cases, DOE will seek legal advice from appropriate legal counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.

      (b)  (1) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA, DOE is required to refer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). Administrative offset is one type of collection tool used by Treasury to collect debts referred under 31 CFR 285.12. Thus, by transferring debts to Treasury, DOE will satisfy the requirement to notify Treasury of debts for the purposes of administrative offset and duplicate referrals are not required. A debt, which is not transferred to Treasury for purposes of debt collection, however, may be subject to the DCIA requirement of notification to Treasury for purposes of administrative offset.

      (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who owe debts referred to Treasury as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt.

      (3) Treasury will notify the debtor/payee in writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice shall include a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of DOE as the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within DOE who will respond to questions regarding the offset.

      (4) As required in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4), DOE will refer a delinquent debt to Treasury for administrative offset, only after the debtor:

      (i) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, the intention of DOE to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; and

      (ii) Has been given:

      (A) The opportunity to inspect and copy DOE records related to the debt;

      (B) The opportunity for a review within DOE of the determination of indebtedness; and

      (C) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

      (iii) DOE may omit the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section when:

      (A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;

      (B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in  v.  995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

      (C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, DOE first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, DOE shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.

      (iv) When DOE previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see § 1015.202), DOE need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.

      (5) When DOE refers delinquent debts to Treasury, DOE must certify, in a form acceptable to Treasury, that:

      (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

      (ii) DOE has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and DOE regulations.

      (6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. Treasury may exempt classes of DOE payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the Secretary of DOE.

      (7) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), Treasury may waive the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from DOE that the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only the Data Integrity Board of Treasury is required to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

      (c)  (1) Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that DOE conducts, at DOE's discretion, internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable non-tax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, DOE may make a request directly to a payment-authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for DOE to request that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.

      (2) DOE shall comply with offset requests by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interest of the United States with respect to the program of DOE, or would otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset.

      (3) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, DOE generally will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.

      (d)  Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, DOE may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      (e)  (1) For purposes of this section, whenever DOE is required to afford a debtor a review within the agency, DOE shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and DOE determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

      (2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although DOE will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

      (3) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which a determination of indebtedness rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and DOE has determined that review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes.

      (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, DOE will accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

      § 1015.204   Reporting debts.

#### § § 1015.204

      (a) DOE may disclose delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), the DCIA, the revised Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904) published November 22, 2000, and other applicable authorities. DOE will ensure that all of the rights and protections afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) have been fulfilled. Additional guidance is contained in Treasury's “Guide to the Federal Credit Bureau Program,” revised October 2001.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury will report debts it is collecting to the appropriate designated credit reporting agencies on behalf of DOE. A debt not transferred to Treasury for purposes of debt collection, however, may be subject to the DCIA requirement to report all non-tax delinquent consumer debts to credit reporting agencies.

      § 1015.205   Credit reports.

#### § § 1015.205

      (a) In order to aid DOE in making appropriate determinations as to the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs; and the likelihood of collecting the claim, DOE may institute a credit investigation of the debtor at any time following receipt of knowledge of the claim.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury may also institute a credit investigation of the debtor on behalf of DOE.

      § 1015.206   Contracting with private collection contractors and with entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

#### § § 1015.206

      (a) DOE may contract with private collection contractors in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), the DCIA, the revised Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904) published November 22, 2000, and other applicable authorities.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA, DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing) under 31 U.S.C. 3711(g). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury may refer delinquent debts to private collection contractors on behalf of DOE.

      (c) DOE may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets of the United States, such as unclaimed assets. DOE must establish procedures acceptable to Treasury before entering into contracts to recover assets of the United States held by a state government or a financial institution.

      (d) DOE may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges DOE for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

      § 1015.207   Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges.

#### § § 1015.207

      (a) Unless waived by the Secretary of DOE or his designee, DOE may not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person who DOE knows to be delinquent on a non-tax debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. The authority to waive the application of this section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and redelegated only to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of DOE. DOE may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. See 31 CFR 285.13 (Barring Delinquent Debtors From Obtaining Federal Loans or Loan Insurance or Guarantees).

      (b) In non-bankruptcy cases, DOE offices seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims should consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay such a debt in accordance with DOE's regulations or governing procedures. The debtor should be advised in DOE's written demand for payment of DOE's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. Any DOE office making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in loans should consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, or broker from doing further business with DOE or engaging in programs sponsored by DOE if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 should be reported to Treasury. Treasury will forward to all interested agencies notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Government has been revoked by Treasury.

      (c) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges also should extend to Federal programs or activities that are administered by the states on behalf of the Federal Government, to the extent that they affect the Federal Government's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors. Therefore, states that manage Federal activities, pursuant to approval from DOE, should ensure that appropriate steps are taken to safeguard against issuing licenses, permits, or privileges to debtors who fail to pay their debts to the Federal Government.

      (d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of DOE's intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, DOE will seek legal advice from counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.

      § 1015.208   Administrative wage garnishment.

#### § § 1015.208

      (a) DOE may use administrative wage garnishment to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay to satisfy delinquent debt in accordance with section 31001(o) of the DCIA, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D. Treasury has issued regulations implementing the administrative wage garnishment provisions contained in the DCIA, at 31 CFR 285.11. DOE has adopted these regulations in their entirety.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e) of this part, under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury may use administrative wage garnishment on behalf of DOE.

      § 1015.209   Tax refund offset.

#### § § 1015.209

      (a) DOE may authorize the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to offset a tax refund to satisfy delinquent debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3720A, Reduction of Tax Refund by Amount of Debt. Treasury has issued regulations implementing the tax refund offset as part of Treasury's mandatory centralized offset at 31 CFR 285.2, Offset of Tax Refund to Collect Past-Due, Legally Enforceable Non-tax Debt. DOE has adopted 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2 in their entirety. The due process requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A are contained in §§ 1015.203(b)(4), and 1015.203(e) of this part.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e) of this part, under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury may use tax refund offset on behalf of DOE.

      § 1015.210   Liquidation of collateral.

#### § § 1015.210

      (a) DOE may liquidate security or collateral through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.

      (b) When DOE learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, DOE will seek legal advice from counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 1015.211   Collection in installments.

#### § § 1015.211

      (a) Whenever feasible, DOE shall collect the total amount of a debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, DOE may accept payment in regular installments. DOE will obtain a current financial statement showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay in one lump sum, and independently verify such representations whenever possible. DOE may also obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess installment requests. DOE may use its own financial information form or a DOJ form, such as the Financial Statement of Debtor (OBD-500) (see § 1015.302(g) of this part). When DOE agrees to accept payments in regular installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable, written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and that contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default.

      (b) The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.

      (c) Security for deferred payments should be obtained in appropriate cases. DOE may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security, at DOE's option.

      § 1015.212   Interest, penalties and administrative costs.

#### § § 1015.212

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, DOE shall charge interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. DOE shall mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to DOE, explaining DOE's requirements concerning these charges except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.

      (b) DOE shall charge interest on debts owed the United States as follows:

      (1) Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law.

      (2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest charged shall be the rate established annually by Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C 3717, DOE may charge a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. DOE will document the reason(s) for its determination that the higher rate is necessary.

      (3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, DOE may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.

      (c) DOE shall assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs should be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined by the assessing office.

      (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, DOE shall charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency.

      (e) DOE may increase an “administrative debt” by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. “Administrative debt” includes, but is not limited to, a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts shall be computed annually. DOE will use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of the debt.

      (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by DOE shall be applied first to outstanding penalties, second to administrative costs, third to interest, and last to principal.

      (g) DOE shall waive the collection of interest and administrative costs imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. DOE may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, DOE may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if DOE determines that collection of these charges is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States.

      (h) When a debtor requests a waiver or review of the debt, DOE will continue to accrue interest, penalties, and administrative costs during the period collection activity is suspended. Upon completion of DOE's review, interest, penalties, and administrative costs related to the portion of the debt found to be without merit will be waived.

      (i) DOE is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law.

      § 1015.213   Analysis of costs.

#### § § 1015.213

      DOE will prepare periodic comparisons of costs incurred and amounts collected. Data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges will be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, assist in evaluating offers in compromise, and establish minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.

      § 1015.214   Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

#### § § 1015.214

      (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt under §§ 1015.100-105 of this part or other authority, DOE may send a request to Treasury to obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the IRS.

      (b) DOE may use mailing addresses obtained under paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.

      § 1015.215   Federal salary offset.

#### § § 1015.215

      (a) DOE may authorize Treasury to offset a Federal salary to satisfy delinquent debt in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, Installment Deduction for Indebtedness to the United States; 5 CFR 550.1101 through 550.1108, Collection by Offset from Indebted Government Employees; 31 CFR parts 900-904, the revised Federal Claims Collection Standards; and 31 CFR 285.7, Salary Offset. DOE shall ensure that all of the rights and protections afforded to the debtor under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 CFR 901.3 have been fulfilled. Claims due from Federal employees will be collected in accordance with DOE Order 2200.2B, Collection from Current and Former Employees for Indebtedness to the United States.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to refer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury may use Federal salary offset on behalf of DOE.

      § 1015.216   Exemptions.

#### § § 1015.216

      (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the DCIA, such as administrative offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1, ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, ) except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the DCIA, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.

      (b) This section should not be construed as prohibiting the use of these authorities or requirements when collecting debts owed by persons employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of this section unless the debt arose under those laws.

    Subpart C—Standards for the Compromise of Claims

      § 1015.300   Scope.

#### § § 1015.300

      This subpart sets forth the standards for the compromise of claims under this part. This subpart corresponds to 31 CFR part 902 of the Treasury Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 1015.301   Scope and application.

#### § § 1015.301

      (a) The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. DOE's Chief Financial Officer or designee or Heads of Field Elements or designees in field locations may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, DOE when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General.

      (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the DOJ. DOE will evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in this part. If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to DOE, DOE shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the DOJ using a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). DOE may obtain the CCLR from the DOJ's National Central Intake Facility. The referral shall include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. DOJ approval is not required if DOE rejects a compromise offer.

      § 1015.302   Bases for compromise.

#### § § 1015.302

      (a) DOE may compromise a debt if the Government cannot collect the full amount because:

      (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information;

      (2) The Government is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings;

      (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount; or

      (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court.

      (b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, DOE should consider relevant factors such as the following:

      (1) Age and health of the debtor;

      (2) Present and potential income;

      (3) Inheritance prospects;

      (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and

      (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.

      (c) DOE will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using a credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. DOE will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. DOE may also consider uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. A compromise effected under this section should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.

      (d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases should fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the litigative risks involved, DOE will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.

      (e) DOE may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, DOE should consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.

      (f) DOE generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, DOE will obtain a legally enforceable, written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full original principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, is reinstated. Whenever possible, DOE also will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in subpart B of this part.

      (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a reasonable time, DOE will, if feasible, obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. DOE also may obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise offers. DOE may use its own financial information form or may request suitable forms from the DOJ or the local United States Attorney's Office.

      § 1015.303   Enforcement policy.

#### § § 1015.303

      Pursuant to this part, DOE may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if DOE's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, present and future, will be adequately served by DOE's acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon.

      § 1015.304   Joint and several liability.

#### § § 1015.304

      (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, DOE will pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. DOE will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors, but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

      (b) DOE will seek to ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release DOE's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor shall not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

      § 1015.305   Further review of compromise offers.

#### § § 1015.305

      If DOE is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, substantive compromise offer on a debt that is within DOE's delegated compromise authority, it may refer the offer to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the DOJ, using a CCLR accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the debt. The DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to DOE with instructions or advice.

      § 1015.306   Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

#### § § 1015.306

      In negotiating a compromise, DOE will consider the tax consequences to the Government. In particular, DOE will consider requiring a waiver of tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor. For information on discharge of indebtedness reporting requirements see § 1015.405 of this part.

      § 1015.307   Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

#### § § 1015.307

      In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by DOE will be implemented by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and all claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction that the debtor may have. In the event a mutual release is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.

    Subpart D—Standards for Suspending or Terminating Collection Activity

      § 1015.400   Scope.

#### § § 1015.400

      The subpart sets forth the standards for terminating collection activity. This subpart corresponds to 31 CFR part 903 of the Treasury Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 1015.401   Scope and application.

#### § § 1015.401

      (a) The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to the DOJ for litigation, DOE may suspend or terminate collection under this part with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred to, DOE.

      (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the DOJ. If DOE believes that suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, DOE shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the DOJ, using the CCLR. The referral should specify the reasons for DOE's recommendation. If, prior to referral to the DOJ, DOE determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, DOE may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.

      § 1015.402   Suspension of collection activity.

#### § § 1015.402

      (a) DOE may suspend collection activity on a debt when:

      (1) DOE cannot locate the debtor;

      (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

      (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

      (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, DOE may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection activity and:

      (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

      (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or

      (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of the debt with interest at a later date.

      (c)(1) DOE shall suspend collection activity during the time required for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or administrative review of the debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits DOE from collecting the debt during that time. As indicated in § 1015.212(h), DOE will continue to accrue interest, penalties, and administrative costs during the period collection activity is suspended.

      (2) If the statute under which the request is sought does not prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, DOE may use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. Further, DOE ordinarily will suspend collection action upon a request for waiver or review if DOE is prohibited by statute or regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected prior to DOE's consideration of the debtor's request. However, DOE will not suspend collection when DOE determines that the request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.

      (d) When DOE learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a debt must be suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, unless DOE can clearly establish that the automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. DOE will seek legal advice immediately from counsel and, if legally permitted, take the necessary legal steps to ensure that no funds or money is paid by DOE to the debtor until relief from the automatic stay is obtained.

      § 1015.403   Termination of collection activity.

#### § § 1015.403

      (a) DOE may terminate collection activity when:

      (1) DOE is unable to collect any substantial amount through its own efforts or through the efforts of others;

      (2) DOE is unable to locate the debtor;

      (3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable;

      (4) The debt is legally without merit, or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

      (5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or

      (6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

      (b) Before terminating collection activity, DOE will have pursued all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The termination of collection activity does not preclude DOE from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

      (1) Selling the debt, if Treasury determines that such sale is in the best interests of the United States;

      (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

      (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

      (4) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.

      (c) Generally, DOE shall terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. DOE may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, if DOE is a known creditor of a debtor, its claims may survive a discharge if DOE did not receive formal notice of the proceedings. DOE will seek legal advice from counsel if it believes it has claims or offsets that may survive the discharge of a debtor.

      § 1015.404   Exception to termination.

#### § § 1015.404

      When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, DOE may refer debts for litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.

      § 1015.405   Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

#### § § 1015.405

      (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a close out of the debt), DOE shall take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as applicable, administrative offset, tax refund offset, Federal salary offset, referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection centers or private collection contractors, credit bureau reporting, wage garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity under § 1015.400 of this part and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this subpart. When DOE discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited. Therefore, DOE will make the determination that collection action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. Before discharging a debt, DOE must terminate debt collection action.

      (b) 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) requires DOE to sell a delinquent non-tax debt upon termination of collection action if Treasury determines such a sale is in the best interests of the United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), DOE may not discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) have been met.

      (c) Upon discharge of an indebtedness, DOE must report the discharge to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. DOE may request Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a discharge report to the IRS on DOE's behalf.

      (d) When discharging a debt, DOE must request that litigation counsel release any liens of record securing the debt.

    Subpart E—Referrals to the Department of Justice

      § 1015.500   Scope.

#### § § 1015.500

      This subpart sets forth the standards for referrals to the Department of Justice. This subpart corresponds to 31 CFR part 904 of the Treasury Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 1015.501   Referrals to the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury's Cross-Servicing Program.

#### § § 1015.501

      (a) DOE may authorize Treasury to refer a delinquent debt to the DOJ for litigation in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), the DCIA, the revised Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904), and other applicable authorities. DOE shall ensure that all of the rights and protections afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) have been fulfilled.

      (b) As described in § 1015.201(e), under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury will refer debts to the DOJ for litigation on behalf of DOE.

      § 1015.502   Prompt referral.

#### § § 1015.502

      (a) If a debt is not referred to the DOJ through Treasury's cross-servicing program, DOE shall promptly refer to the DOJ for litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with § 1015.200 of this part and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with §§ 1015.300 and 1015.400 of this part. DOE may refer those debts arising out of activities of DOE. Debts for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, shall be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at the DOJ, Washington, DC. Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000, or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, shall be referred to the DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the CCLR instructions. Claims will be referred as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection activity and the observance of the standards contained in the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904), and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors. DOE shall make every effort to refer delinquent debts to the DOJ for litigation within one year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, DOE will make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to the DOJ for litigation within one year from the date the loan was presented to DOE for payment or re-insurance.

      (b) The DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts referred to it pursuant to this section. DOE shall refrain from having any contact with the debtor and shall direct all debtor inquiries concerning the claim to the DOJ. DOE shall notify the DOJ immediately of any payments credited by DOE to the debtor's account after referral of a debt or claim under this section. The DOJ shall notify DOE, in a timely manner, of any payments it receives from the debtor.

      § 1015.503   Claims Collection Litigation Report.

#### § § 1015.503

      (a) Unless excepted by the DOJ, DOE shall complete the CCLR (see § 1015.301 of this part), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to the DOJ for litigation. DOE shall complete all of the sections of the CCLR appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.

      (b) DOE shall indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions it wishes the DOJ to take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits DOE to indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which the DOJ may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.

      (c) DOE also shall use the CCLR to refer claims to the DOJ to obtain the DOJ's approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or terminate DOE collection activity.

      § 1015.504   Preservation of evidence.

#### § § 1015.504

  PART 1016—SAFEGUARDING OF RESTRICTED DATA BY ACCESS PERMITTEES

### Part 1016

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 161i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 948 (42 U.S.C. 2201).

**Source:** Source: 48 FR 36432, Aug. 10, 1983, unless otherwise noted.

    General Provisions

      § 1016.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1016.1

      The regulations in this part establish requirements for the safeguarding of Secret and Confidential Restricted Data received or developed under an access permit. This part does not apply to Top Secret information since no such information may be forwarded to an access permittee within the scope of this regulation.

      § 1016.2   Scope.

#### § § 1016.2

      The regulations in this part apply to all persons who may require access to Retricted Data used, processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, or handled in connection with an access permit.

      § 1016.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1016.3

      (a)  An administrative determination by DOE that an individual who is either a DOE employee, applicant for employment, consultant, assignee, other Federal department or agency employee (or other persons who may be designated by the Secretary of Energy), or a DOE contractor or subcontractor employee, or an access permittee is eligible for access to Restricted Data. Access authorizations granted by DOE are designated as “Q,” “Q(X),” “L,” or “L(X).”

      (1) “Q” access authorizations are based upon single scope background investigations as set forth in applicable DOE and national-level directives. They permit an individual who has “need to know” access to Top Secret, Secret and Confidential Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information, or special nuclear material in Category I or II quantities as required in the performance of duties, subject to additional determination that permitting this access will not endanger the common defense or national security of the United States. There may be additional requirements for access to specific types of RD information.

      (2) “Q(X)” access authorizations are based upon the same level of investigation required for a Q access authorization. When “Q” access authorizations are granted to access permittees they are identified as “Q(X)” access authorizations and, as need-to-know applies, authorize access only to the type of Secret Restricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”

      (3) “L” access authorizations are based upon a Tier III (formerly National Agency Check with Local Agency Checks and Credit Checks (NACLC)/Access National Agency Check with Inquiries (ANACI)) background investigation as set forth in applicable national-level directives. They permit an individual who has “need to know” access to Confidential Restricted Data, Secret and Confidential Formerly Restricted Data, or Secret and Confidential National Security Information, required in the performance of duties, provided such information is not designated “CRYPTO” (classified cryptographic information), “COMSEC” (communications security), or intelligence information and subject to additional determination that permitting this access will not endanger the common defense or national security of the United States. There may be additional requirements for access to specific types of RD information.

      (4) “L(X)” access authorizations are based upon the same level of investigation required for an “L” access authorization. When “L” access authorizations are granted to access permittees, they are identified as “L(X)” access authorizations and, as need to know applies, authorize access only to the type of Confidential Restricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”

      (b)  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 919) as amended.

      (c)  A mail address established for each access permittee and approved by the DOE to be used when sending Restricted Data to the permittee.

      (d)  Anything in physical form (including, but not limited to documents and material) that contains or reveals classified information.

      (e)  A built-in combination lock on a security container which is of tempered steel alloy hard plate, at least  ″ in thickness and Rockwell hardness of C-63 to C-65, of sufficient size and so located as to sufficiently impede access to the locking mechanism by drilling of the lock or container.

      (f)  The United States Department of Energy or its duly authorized representatives.

      (g)  Classified information jointly determined by the DOE and the Department of Defense to be related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and removed by the DOE from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142(d) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

      (h)  An act or omission involving failure to comply with DOE safeguards and security orders, directives, or approvals and may include a violation of law.

      (i)  A security system consisting of sensors capable of detecting one or more types of phenomena, signal media, annunciators, energy sources, alarm assessment systems, and alarm reporting elements including alarm communications and information display equipment.

      (j)  The national defense and foreign relations of the United States.

      (k)  Information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 13526, as amended “Classified National Security Information” or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.

      (l)  A determination by persons having responsibility for classified information or matter, that a proposed recipient's access to such classified information or matter is necessary in the performance of official, contractual, or access permit duties of employment under cognizance of the DOE.

      (m)  The holder of an Access Permit issued pursuant to the regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 725, “Permits For Access to Restricted Data.”

      (n)  Any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, Government agency other than DOE, any State or any political subdivision of, or any political entity within a State, or other entity; and any legal successor, representative, agency, or agency of the foregoing.

      (o)  Guards or watchmen or other persons designated responsibility for the protection of classified matter.

      (p)  All data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Act.

      (q)  A physically defined space containing classified matter and subject to physical protection and personnel access controls.

      (r)  See access authorization.

      (s)  Any facility, including an access permittee, which has been approved by the DOE for using, processing, storing, reproducing, transmitting, or handling classified matter.

      (t)  A determination by the DOE that a facility, including an access permittee, is eligible to use, process, store, reproduce, transmit, or handle classified matter.

      (u)  A written plan by the access permittee, and submitted to the DOE for approval, which outlines the permittee's proposed security procedures and controls for the protection of Restricted Data and which includes a floor plan of the area in which the classified matter is to be used, processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, or handled.

      (v)  An onsite examination by a DOE representative of all devices, equipment, and procedures employed at a security facility to safeguard classified matter.

    Subpart B—Initially Determining What Information Is Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information

      § 1017.6   Authority.

#### § § 1017.6

      The Secretary, or his or her designee, determines whether information is UCNI. These determinations are incorporated into guidance that each Reviewing Official and Denying Official consults in his or her review of a document or material to decide whether the document or material contains UCNI.

      § 1017.7   Criteria.

#### § § 1017.7

      To be identified as UCNI, the information must meet each of the following criteria:

      (a) The information must be Government information as defined in § 1017.4;

      (b) The information must concern atomic energy defense programs as defined in § 1017.4;

      (c) The information must fall within the scope of at least one of the three subject areas eligible to be UCNI in § 1017.8;

      (d) The information must meet the adverse effect test described in § 1017.10; and

      (e) The information must not be exempt from being UCNI under § 1017.11.

      § 1017.8   Subject areas eligible to be Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information.

#### § § 1017.8

      To be eligible for identification as UCNI, information must concern at least one of the following categories:

      (a) The design of production or utilization facilities as defined in this part;

      (b) Security measures (including security plans, procedures, and equipment) for the physical protection of production or utilization facilities or nuclear material, regardless of its physical state or form, contained in these facilities or in transit; or

      § 1017.9   Nuclear material determinations.

#### § § 1017.9

      (a) The Secretary may determine that a material other than special nuclear material, byproduct material, or source material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act is included within the scope of the term “nuclear material” if it meets the following criteria:

      (1) The material is used in the production, testing, utilization, or assembly of nuclear weapons or components of nuclear weapons; and

      (2) Unauthorized acquisition of the material could reasonably be expected to result in a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security because the specific material:

      (i) Could be used as a hazardous radioactive environmental contaminant; or

      (ii) Could be of significant assistance in the illegal production of a nuclear weapon.

      (b) Designation of a material as a nuclear material under paragraph (a) of this section does not make all information about the material UCNI. Specific information about the material must still meet each of the criteria in § 1017.7 prior to its being identified and controlled as UCNI.

      § 1017.10   Adverse effect test.

#### § § 1017.10

      In order for information to be identified as UCNI, it must be determined that the unauthorized dissemination of the information under review could reasonably be expected to result in a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of:

      (a) Illegal production of a nuclear weapon; or

      (b) Theft, diversion, or sabotage of nuclear material, equipment, or facilities.

      § 1017.11   Information exempt from being Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information.

#### § § 1017.11

      Information exempt from this part includes:

      (a) Information protected from disclosure under section 147 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2167) that is identified as Safeguards Information and controlled by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission;

      § 1017.12   Prohibitions on identifying Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information.

#### § § 1017.12

      Information, documents, and material must not be identified as being or containing UCNI in order to:

      (a) Conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;

      (b) Prevent embarrassment to a person or organization;

      (c) Restrain competition; or,

      (d) Prevent or delay the release of any information that does not properly qualify as UCNI.

      § 1017.13   Report concerning determinations.

#### § § 1017.13

      The Office of Classification or successor office shall issue a report by the end of each quarter that identifies any new information that has been determined for the first time to be UCNI during the previous quarter, explains how each such determination meets the criteria in § 1017.7, and explains why each such determination protects from disclosure only the minimum amount of information necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security. A copy of the report may be obtained by writing to the Office of Classification, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585-1290.

    Subpart C—Review of a Document or Material for Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information

      § 1017.14   Designated officials.

#### § § 1017.14

      (a) —(1)  A _Reviewing Official_ with cognizance over the information contained in a document or material is authorized to determine whether the document or material contains UCNI based on applicable guidance. A Reviewing Official marks or authorizes the marking of the document or material as specified in § 1017.16.

      (2)  Procedures for requesting that a DOE Federal or contractor employee be designated as a Reviewing Official are contained in Departmental directives issued by the Secretary. DOE may also designate other Government agency employees, contractors, or other individuals granted routine access under § 1017.20 as Reviewing Officials.

      (3)  Prior to being designated as a Reviewing Official, each employee must receive training approved by DOE that covers the requirements in these regulations and be tested on his or her proficiency in using applicable UCNI guidance. Upon successful completion of the training and test, he or she is designated as a Reviewing Official only while serving in his or her current position for a maximum of 3 years. The employee does not automatically retain the authority when he or she leaves his or her current position. The employee cannot delegate this authority to anyone else, and the authority may not be assumed by another employee acting in the employee's position. At the end of 3 years, if the position still requires the authority, the employee must be retested and redesignated by DOE as a Reviewing Official.

      (b) —(1)  Other Government agency employees who are approved by DOE or another Government agency to use classification guidance developed by DOE or jointly by DOE and another Government agency may also be approved to review documents for UCNI and to make UCNI determinations. This authority is limited to the UCNI subject areas contained in the specific classification guidance that the individual has been approved to use.

      (2)  Individuals must be designated this authority in writing by the appropriate DOE or other Government agency official with cognizance over the specific DOE or joint DOE classification guidance.

      (c) —(1)  A DOE _Denying Official_ for unclassified information with cognizance over the information contained in a document is authorized to deny a request made under statute (e.g., the FOIA, the Privacy Act) or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 12958, as amended, “Classified National Security Information,” and its successor orders, for all or any portion of the document that contains UCNI. The Denying Official bases his or her denial on applicable guidance, ensuring that the Reviewing Official who determined that the document contains UCNI correctly interpreted and applied the guidance.

      (2)  Information on the designation of DOE Denying Officials is contained in 10 CFR Part 1004,  (see definition of the term “Authorizing or Denying Official” in § 1004.2).

      § 1017.15   Review process.

#### § § 1017.15

      (a)  Anyone who originates or possesses a document that he or she thinks may contain UCNI must send the document to a Reviewing Official for a determination before it is finalized, sent outside of his or her organization, or filed. If the originator or possessor must send the document outside of his or her organization for the review, he or she must mark the front of the document with “Protect as UCNI Pending Review” and must transmit the document in accordance with the requirements in § 1017.27. The Reviewing Official must first determine whether the document is widely disseminated in the public domain, which means that the document under review is publicly available from a Government technical information service or depository library, for example, or that it can be found in a public library or an open literature source, or it can be accessed on the Internet using readily available search methods.

      (1) If the document is determined to be widely disseminated in the public domain, it cannot be controlled as UCNI. The Reviewing Official returns the document to the person who sent it to the Reviewing Official and informs him or her why the document cannot be controlled as UCNI. This does not preclude control of the same information as UCNI if it is contained in another document that is not widely disseminated.

      (2) If the document is not determined to be widely disseminated in the public domain, the Reviewing Official evaluates the information in the document using guidance to determine whether the document contains UCNI. If the Reviewing Official determines that the document does contain UCNI, the Reviewing Official marks or authorizes the marking of the document as specified in § 1017.16. If the Reviewing Official determines that the document does not contain UCNI, the Reviewing Official returns the document to the person who sent it and informs him or her that the document does not contain UCNI. For documentation purposes, the Reviewing Official may mark or authorize the marking of the document as specified in § 1017.17(b).

      (3) If no applicable guidance exists, but the Reviewing Official thinks the information should be identified as UCNI, then the Reviewing Official must send the document to the appropriate official identified in applicable DOE directives issued by the Secretary or his or her designee. The Reviewing Official should also include a written recommendation as to why the information should be identified as UCNI.

      (b)  Any document that was permanently filed prior to May 22, 1985, is not required to be reviewed for UCNI while in the files or when retrieved from the files for reference, inventory, or similar purposes as long as the document will be returned to the files and is not accessible by individuals who are not Authorized Individuals for the UCNI contained in the document. However, when a document that is likely to contain UCNI is removed from the files for dissemination within or outside of the immediate organization, it must be reviewed by a Reviewing Official with cognizance over the information.

      (c)  Anyone who produces or possesses material that he or she thinks may contain or reveal UCNI must consult with a Reviewing Official for a determination. If the Reviewing Official determines that the material does contain or reveal UCNI, the Reviewing Official marks or authorizes the marking of the material as specified in § 1017.16(b).

      § 1017.16   Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information markings on documents or material.

#### § § 1017.16

      (a)  If a Reviewing Official determines that a document contains UCNI, the Reviewing Official must mark or authorize the marking of the document as described in this section.

      (1)  The following marking must appear on the front of the document:

      (2)  The marking “Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information” must be placed on the bottom of the front of the document and on the bottom of each interior page of the document that contains text or if more convenient, on the bottom of only those interior pages that contain UCNI. The page marking must also be placed on the back of the last page. If space limitations do not allow for use of the full page marking, the acronym “UCNI” may be used as the page marking.

      (3)  UCNI front and page markings are not applied to a classified document that also contains UCNI. If a classified document is portion marked, the acronym “UCNI” is used to indicate those unclassified portions that contain UCNI.

      (4) Obsolete “May Contain UCNI” marking. The “May Contain UCNI” marking is no longer used. Any document marked with the “May Contain UCNI” marking is considered to contain UCNI and must be protected accordingly until a Reviewing Official or Denying Official determines otherwise. The obsolete “May Contain UCNI” marking reads as follows:

      (b)  If possible, material containing or revealing UCNI must be marked as described in § 1017.16(a)(1). If space limitations do not allow for use of the full marking in § 1017.16(a)(1), the acronym “UCNI” may be used.

      § 1017.17   Determining that a document or material no longer contains or does not contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information.

#### § § 1017.17

      (a)  A Reviewing Official with cognizance over the information in a document or material marked as containing UCNI may determine that the document or material no longer contains UCNI. A Denying Official may also determine that such a document or material no longer contains UCNI. The official making this determination must base it on applicable guidance and must ensure that any UCNI markings are crossed out (for documents) or removed (for material). The official marks or authorizes the marking of the document (or the material, if space allows) as follows:

      (b)  A Reviewing Official with cognizance over the information in a document or material may confirm that an unmarked document or material does not contain UCNI based on applicable guidance. No UCNI markings are required in this case; however, for documentation purposes, the Reviewing Official may mark or may authorize the marking of the document or material with the same marking used in § 1017.17(a).

      § 1017.18   Joint documents or material.

#### § § 1017.18

      If a document or material marked as containing UCNI is under consideration for decontrol and falls under the cognizance of another DOE organization or other Government agency, the Reviewing Official or Denying Official must coordinate the decontrol review with that DOE organization or other Government agency. Any disagreement concerning the control or decontrol of any document or material that contains UCNI that was originated by or for DOE or another Government agency is resolved by the Secretary or his or her designee.

    Subpart D—Access to Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information

      § 1017.19   Access limitations.

#### § § 1017.19

      A person may only have access to UCNI if he or she has been granted routine access by an Authorized Individual (see § 1017.20) or limited access by the DOE Program Secretarial Officer or NNSA Deputy or Associate Administrator with cognizance over the UCNI (see § 1017.21). The Secretary, or his or her designee, may impose additional administrative controls concerning the granting of routine or limited access to UCNI to a person who is not a U.S. citizen.

      (a) For each DOE proposal, DOE shall coordinate its NEPA review with its decisionmaking. Sections 1021.211 through 1021.214 of this part specify how DOE will coordinate its NEPA review with decision points for certain types of proposals (40 CFR 1505.1(b)).

      (b) DOE shall complete its NEPA review for each DOE proposal before making a decision on the proposal (e.g., normally in advance of, and for use in reaching, a decision to proceed with detailed design), except as provided in 40 CFR 1506.1 and §§ 1021.211 and 1021.216 of this part.

      (c) During the decisionmaking process for each DOE proposal, DOE shall consider the relevant NEPA documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and DOE responses to those comments, as part of its consideration of the proposal (40 CFR 1505.1(d)) and shall include such documents, comments, and responses as part of the administrative record (40 CFR 1505.1(c)).

      (d) If an EIS or EA is prepared for a DOE proposal, DOE shall consider the alternatives analyzed in that EIS or EA before rendering a decision on that proposal; the decision on the proposal shall be within the range of alternatives analyzed in the EA or EIS (40 CFR 1505.1(e)).

      (e) When DOE uses a broad decision (such as one on a policy or program) as a basis for a subsequent narrower decision (such as one on a project or other site-specific proposal), DOE may use tiering (40 CFR 1502.20) and incorporation of material by reference (40 CFR 1502.21) in the NEPA review for the subsequent narrower proposal.

      § 1021.211   Interim actions: Limitations on actions during the NEPA process.

#### § § 1021.211

      While DOE is preparing an EIS that is required under § 1021.300(a) of this part, DOE shall take no action concerning the proposal that is the subject of the EIS before issuing an ROD, except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1. Actions that are covered by, or are a part of, a DOE proposal for which an EIS is being prepared shall not be categorically excluded under subpart D of these regulations unless they qualify as interim actions under 40 CFR 1506.1.

      § 1021.212   Research, development, demonstration, and testing.

#### § § 1021.212

      (a) This section applies to the adoption and application of programs that involve research, development, demonstration, and testing for new technologies (40 CFR 1502.4(c)(3)). Adoption of such programs might also lead to commercialization or other broad-scale implementation by DOE or another entity.

      (b) For any proposed program described in paragraph (a) of this section, DOE shall begin its NEPA review (if otherwise required by this part) as soon as environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated, and before DOE has reached the level of investment or commitment likely to determine subsequent development or restrict later alternatives, as discussed at 40 CFR 1502.4(c)(3).

      (c) For subsequent phases of development and application, DOE shall prepare one or more additional NEPA documents (if otherwise required by this part).

      § 1021.213   Rulemaking.

#### § § 1021.213

      (a) This section applies to regulations promulgated by DOE.

      (b) DOE shall begin its NEPA review of a proposed rule (if otherwise required by this part) while drafting the proposed regulation, and as soon as environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated.

      (c) DOE shall include any relevant NEPA documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and DOE responses to those comments, as part of the administrative record (40 CFR 1505.1(c)).

      (d) If an EIS is required, DOE will normally publish the draft EIS at the time it publishes the proposed rule (40 CFR 1502.5(d)). DOE will normally combine any public hearings required for a proposed rule with the public hearings required on the draft EIS under § 1021.313 of this part. The draft EIS need not accompany notices of inquiry or advance notices of proposed rulemaking that DOE may use to gather information during early stages of regulation development. When engaged in rulemaking for the purpose of protecting the public health and safety, DOE may issue the final rule simultaneously with publication of the EPA Notice of Availability of the final EIS in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b).

      (e) If an EA is required, DOE will normally complete the EA and issue any related FONSI prior to or simultaneously with issuance of the proposed rule; however, if the EA leads to preparation of an EIS, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.

      § 1021.214   Adjudicatory proceedings.

#### § § 1021.214

      (a) This section applies to DOE proposed actions that involve DOE adjudicatory proceedings, excluding judicial or administrative civil or criminal enforcement actions.

      (b) DOE shall complete its NEPA review (if otherwise required by this part) before rendering any final adjudicatory decision. If an EIS is required, the final EIS will normally be completed at the time of or before final staff recommendation, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.5(c).

      (c) DOE shall include any relevant NEPA documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and DOE responses to those comments, as part of the administrative record (40 CFR 1505.1(c)).

      § 1021.215   Applicant process.

#### § § 1021.215

      (a) This section applies to actions that involve application to DOE for a permit, license, exemption or allocation, or other similar actions, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under subpart D of this part.

      (b) The applicant shall:

      (1) Consult with DOE as early as possible in the planning process to obtain guidance with respect to the appropriate level and scope of any studies or environmental information that DOE may require to be submitted as part of, or in support of, the application;

      (2) Conduct studies that DOE deems necessary and appropriate to determine the environmental impacts of the proposed action;

      (3) Consult with appropriate Federal, state, regional and local agencies, American Indian tribes and other potentially interested parties during the preliminary planning stages of the proposed action to identify environmental factors and permitting requirements;

      (4) Notify DOE as early as possible of other Federal, state, regional, local or American Indian tribal actions required for project completion to allow DOE to coordinate the Federal environmental review, and fulfill the requirements of 40 CFR 1506.2 regarding elimination of duplication with state and local procedures, as appropriate;

      (5) Notify DOE of private entities and organizations interested in the proposed undertaking, in order that DOE can consult, as appropriate, with these parties in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.2(d)(2); and

      (6) Notify DOE if, before DOE completes the environmental review, the applicant plans to take an action that is within DOE's jurisdiction that may have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of alternatives. If DOE determines that the action would have an adverse environmental impact or would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives under 40 CFR 1506.1(a), DOE will promptly notify the applicant that DOE will take appropriate action to ensure that the objectives and procedures of NEPA are achieved in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.1(b).

      (c) For major categories of DOE actions involving a large number of applicants, DOE may prepare and make available generic guidance describing the recommended level and scope of environmental information that applicants should provide.

      (d) DOE shall begin its NEPA review (if otherwise required by this part) as soon as possible after receiving an application described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall independently evaluate and verify the accuracy of information received from an applicant in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(a). At DOE's option, an applicant may prepare an EA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b). If an EIS is prepared, the EIS shall be prepared by DOE or by a contractor that is selected by DOE and that may be funded by the applicant, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(c). The contractor shall provide a disclosure statement in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(c). DOE shall complete any NEPA documents (or evaluation of any EA prepared by the applicant) before rendering a final decision on the application and shall consider the NEPA document in reaching its decision, as provided in § 1021.210 of this part.

      § 1021.216   Procurement, financial assistance, and joint ventures.

#### § § 1021.216

      (a) This section applies to DOE competitive and limited-source procurements, to awards of financial assistance by a competitive process, and to joint ventures entered into as a result of competitive solicitations, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under subpart D of this part. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (i) of this section apply as well to DOE sole-source procurements of sites, systems, or processes, to noncompetitive awards of financial assistance, and to sole-source joint ventures, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under subpart D of this part.

      (b) When relevant in DOE's judgment, DOE shall require that offeror's submit environmental data and analyses as a discrete part of the offeror's proposal. DOE shall specify in its solicitation document the type of information and level of detail for environmental data and analyses so required. The data will be limited to those reasonably available to offerors.

      (c) DOE shall independently evaluate and verify the accuracy of environmental data and analyses submitted by offerors.

      (d) For offers in the competitive range, DOE shall prepare and consider an environmental critique before the selection.

      (e) The environmental critique will be subject to the confidentiality requirements of the procurement process.

      (f) The environmental critique will evaluate the environmental data and analyses submitted by offerors; it may also evaluate supplemental information developed by DOE as necessary for a reasoned decision.

      (g) The environmental critique will focus on environmental issues that are pertinent to a decision on proposals and will include:

      (1) A brief discussion of the purpose of the procurement and each offer, including any site, system, or process variations among the offers having environmental implications;

      (2) A discussion of the salient characteristics of each offeror's proposed site, system, or process as well as alternative sites, systems, or processes;

      (3) A brief comparative evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the offers, which will address direct and indirect effects, short-term and long-term effects, proposed mitigation measures, adverse effects that cannot be avoided, areas where important environmental information is incomplete and unavailable, unresolved environmental issues and practicable mitigating measures not included in the offeror's proposal; and

      (4) To the extent known for each offer, a list of Federal, Tribal, state, and local government permits, licenses, and approvals that must be obtained.

      (h) DOE shall prepare a publicly available environmental synopsis, based on the environmental critique, to document the consideration given to environmental factors and to record that the relevant environmental consequences of reasonable alternatives have been evaluated in the selection process. The synopsis will not contain business, confidential, trade secret or other information that DOE otherwise would not disclose pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1905, the confidentiality requirements of the competitive procurement process, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and 41 U.S.C. 423. To assure compliance with this requirement, the synopsis will not contain data or other information that may in any way reveal the identity of offerors. After a selection has been made, the environmental synopsis shall be filed with EPA, shall be made publicly available, and shall be incorporated in any NEPA document prepared under paragraph (i) of this section.

      (i) If an EA or EIS is required, DOE shall prepare, consider and publish the EA or EIS in conformance with the CEQ Regulations and other provisions of this part before taking any action pursuant to the contract or award of financial assistance (except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and § 1021.211 of this part). If the NEPA process is not completed before the award of the contract, financial assistance, or joint venture, then the contract, financial assistance, or joint venture shall be contingent on completion of the NEPA process (except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and § 1021.211 of this part). DOE shall phase subsequent contract work to allow the NEPA review process to be completed in advance of a go/no-go decision.

    Subpart C—Implementing Procedures

      § 1021.300   General requirements.

#### § § 1021.300

      (a) DOE shall determine, under the procedures in the CEQ Regulations and this part, whether any DOE proposal:

      (1) Requires preparation of an EIS;

      (2) Requires preparation of an EA; or

      (3) Is categorically excluded from preparation of either an EIS or an EA.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, DOE may prepare a NEPA document for any DOE action at any time in order to further the purposes of NEPA. This may be done to analyze the consequences of ongoing activities, support DOE planning, assess the need for mitigation, fully disclose the potential environmental consequences of DOE actions, or for any other reason. Documents prepared under this paragraph shall be prepared in the same manner as DOE documents prepared under paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 1021.301   Agency review and public participation.

#### § § 1021.301

      (a) DOE shall make its NEPA documents available to other Federal agencies, states, local governments, American Indian tribes, interested groups, and the general public, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6, except as provided in § 1021.340 of this part.

      (b) Wherever feasible, DOE NEPA documents shall explain technical, scientific, or military terms or measurements using terms familiar to the general public, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.8.

      (c) DOE shall notify the host state and host tribe of a DOE determination to prepare an EA or EIS for a DOE proposal, and may notify any other state or American Indian tribe that, in DOE's judgment, may be affected by the proposal.

      (d) DOE shall provide the host state and host tribe with an opportunity to review and comment on any DOE EA prior to DOE's approval of the EA. DOE may also provide any other state or American Indian tribe with the same opportunity if, in DOE's judgment, the state or tribe may be affected by the proposed action. At DOE's discretion, this review period shall be from 14 to 30 days. DOE shall consider all comments received from a state or tribe during the review period before approving or modifying the EA, as appropriate. If all states and tribes afforded this opportunity for preapproval review waive such opportunity, or provide a response before the end of the comment period, DOE may proceed to approve or take other appropriate action on the EA before the end of the review period.

      (e) Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to power marketing actions, such as rate-setting, in which a state or American Indian tribe is a customer, or to any other circumstances where DOE determines that such advance information could create a conflict of interest.

      § 1021.310   Environmental impact statements.

#### § § 1021.310

      DOE shall prepare and circulate EISs and related RODs in accordance with the requirements of the CEQ Regulations, as supplemented by this subpart.

      § 1021.331   Mitigation action plans.

#### § § 1021.331

      (a) Following completion of each EIS and its associated ROD, DOE shall prepare a Mitigation Action Plan that addresses mitigation commitments expressed in the ROD. The Mitigation Action Plan shall explain how the corresponding mitigation measures, designed to mitigate adverse environmental impacts associated with the course of action directed by the ROD, will be planned and implemented. The Mitigation Action Plan shall be prepared before DOE takes any action directed by the ROD that is the subject of a mitigation commitment.

      (b) In certain circumstances, as specified in § 1021.322(b)(1), DOE shall also prepare a Mitigation Action Plan for commitments to mitigations that are essential to render the impacts of the proposed action not significant. The Mitigation Action Plan shall address all commitments to such necessary mitigations and explain how mitigation will be planned and implemented. The Mitigation Action Plan shall be prepared before the FONSI is issued and shall be referenced therein.

      (c) Each Mitigation Action Plan shall be as complete as possible, commensurate with the information available regarding the course of action either directed by the ROD or the action to be covered by the FONSI, as appropriate. DOE may revise the Plan as more specific and detailed information becomes available.

      (d) DOE shall make copies of the Mitigation Action Plans available for inspection in the appropriate DOE public reading room(s) or other appropriate location(s) for a reasonable time. Copies of the Mitigation Action Plans shall also be available upon written request.

      § 1021.340   Classified, confidential, and otherwise exempt information.

#### § § 1021.340

      (a) Notwithstanding other sections of this part, DOE shall not disclose classified, confidential, or other information that DOE otherwise would not disclose pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) and 10 CFR 1004.10(b) of DOE's regulations implementing the FOIA, except as provided by 40 CFR 1506.6(f).

      (b) To the fullest extent possible, DOE shall segregate any information that is exempt from disclosure requirements into an appendix to allow public review of the remainder of a NEPA document.

      (c) If exempt information cannot be segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially meaningless material, DOE shall withhold the entire NEPA document from the public; however, DOE shall prepare the NEPA document, in accordance with the CEQ Regulations and this part, and use it in DOE decisionmaking.

      § 1021.341   Coordination with other environmental review requirements.

#### § § 1021.341

      (a) In accordance with 40 CFR 1500.4(k) and (o), 1502.25, and 1506.4, DOE shall integrate the NEPA process and coordinate NEPA compliance with other environmental review requirements to the fullest extent possible.

      (b) To the extent possible, DOE shall determine the applicability of other environmental requirements early in the planning process, in consultation with other agencies when necessary or appropriate, to ensure compliance and to avoid delays, and shall incorporate any relevant requirements as early in the NEPA review process as possible.

      § 1021.342   Interagency cooperation.

#### § § 1021.342

      For DOE programs that involve another Federal agency or agencies in related decisions subject to NEPA, DOE will comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. As part of this process, DOE shall cooperate with the other agencies in developing environmental information and in determining whether a proposal requires preparation of an EIS or EA, or can be categorically excluded from preparation of either. Further, where appropriate and acceptable to the other agencies, DOE shall develop or cooperate in the development of interagency agreements to facilitate coordination and to reduce delay and duplication.

      § 1021.343   Variances.

#### § § 1021.343

      (a)  DOE may take an action without observing all provisions of this part or the CEQ Regulations, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.11, in emergency situations that demand immediate action. DOE shall consult with CEQ as soon as possible regarding alternative arrangements for emergency actions having significant environmental impacts. DOE shall document, including publishing a notice in the  emergency actions covered by this paragraph within 30 days after such action occurs; this documentation shall identify any adverse impacts from the actions taken, further mitigation necessary, and any NEPA documents that may be required.

      (b)  On a case-by-case basis, DOE may reduce time periods established in this part that are not required by the CEQ Regulations. If DOE determines that such reduction is necessary, DOE shall publish a notice in the  specifying the revised time periods and the rationale for the reduction.

      (c)  Any variance from the requirements of this part, other than as provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, must be soundly based on the interests of national security or the public health, safety, or welfare and must have the advance written approval of the Secretary; however, the Secretary is not authorized to waive or grant a variance from any requirement of the CEQ Regulations (except as provided for in those regulations). If the Secretary determines that a variance from the requirements of this part is within his/her authority to grant and is necessary, DOE shall publish a notice in the  specifying the variance granted and the reasons.

    Subpart D—Typical Classes of Actions

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 63787, Oct. 13, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1021.400   Level of NEPA review.

#### § § 1021.400

      (a) This subpart identifies DOE actions that normally:

      (1) Do not require preparation of either an EIS or an EA (are categorically excluded from preparation of either document) (appendices A and B to this subpart D);

      (2) Require preparation of an EA, but not necessarily an EIS (appendix C to this subpart D); or

      (3) Require preparation of an EIS (appendix D to this subpart D).

      (b) Any completed, valid NEPA review does not have to be repeated, and no completed NEPA documents need to be redone by reasons of these regulations, except as provided in § 1021.314.

      (c) If a DOE proposal is encompassed within a class of actions listed in the appendices to this subpart D, DOE shall proceed with the level of NEPA review indicated for that class of actions, unless there are extraordinary circumstances related to the specific proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal.

      (d) If a DOE proposal is not encompassed within the classes of actions listed in the appendices to this subpart D, or if there are extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal, DOE shall either:

      (1) Prepare an EA and, on the basis of that EA, determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI; or

      (2) Prepare an EIS and ROD.

      § 1021.410   Application of categorical exclusions (classes of actions that normally do not require EAs or EISs).

#### § § 1021.410

      (a) The actions listed in appendices A and B to this subpart D are classes of actions that DOE has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (categorical exclusions).

      (b) To find that a proposal is categorically excluded, DOE shall determine the following:

      (1) The proposal fits within a class of actions that is listed in appendix A or B to this subpart D;

      (2) There are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal. Extraordinary circumstances are unique situations presented by specific proposals, including, but not limited to, scientific controversy about the environmental effects of the proposal; uncertain effects or effects involving unique or unknown risks; and unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources; and

      (3) The proposal has not been segmented to meet the definition of a categorical exclusion. Segmentation can occur when a proposal is broken down into small parts in order to avoid the appearance of significance of the total action. The scope of a proposal must include the consideration of connected and cumulative actions, that is, the proposal is not connected to other actions with potentially significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)), is not related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)), and is not precluded by 40 CFR 1506.1 or § 1021.211 of this part concerning limitations on actions during EIS preparation.

      (c) All categorical exclusions may be applied by any organizational element of DOE. The sectional divisions in appendix B to this subpart D are solely for purposes of organization of that appendix and are not intended to be limiting.

      (d) A class of actions includes activities foreseeably necessary to proposals encompassed within the class of actions (such as award of implementing grants and contracts, site preparation, purchase and installation of equipment, and associated transportation activities).

      (e) Categorical exclusion determinations for actions listed in appendix B shall be documented and made available to the public by posting online, generally within two weeks of the determination, unless additional time is needed in order to review and protect classified information, “confidential business information,” or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). Posted categorical exclusion determinations shall not disclose classified information, “confidential business information,” or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to FOIA. (See also 10 CFR 1021.340.)

      (f) Proposed recurring activities to be undertaken during a specified time period, such as routine maintenance activities for a year, may be addressed in a single categorical exclusion determination after considering the potential aggregated impacts.

      (g) The following clarifications are provided to assist in the appropriate application of categorical exclusions that employ the terms or phrases:

      (1) “Previously disturbed or developed” refers to land that has been changed such that its functioning ecological processes have been and remain altered by human activity. The phrase encompasses areas that have been transformed from natural cover to non-native species or a managed state, including, but not limited to, utility and electric power transmission corridors and rights-of-way, and other areas where active utilities and currently used roads are readily available.

      (2) DOE considers terms such as “small” and “small-scale” in the context of the particular proposal, including its proposed location. In assessing whether a proposed action is small, in addition to the actual magnitude of the proposal, DOE considers factors such as industry norms, the relationship of the proposed action to similar types of development in the vicinity of the proposed action, and expected outputs of emissions or waste. When considering the physical size of a proposed facility, for example, DOE would review the surrounding land uses, the scale of the proposed facility relative to existing development, and the capacity of existing roads and other infrastructure to support the proposed action.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1022.1   Background.

#### § § 1022.1

      (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 11988—Floodplain Management (May 24, 1977) directs each Federal agency to issue or amend existing regulations and procedures to ensure that the potential effects of any action it may take in a floodplain are evaluated and that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and floodplain management. Guidance for implementation of the E.O. is provided in the floodplain management guidelines of the U.S. Water Resources Council (40 FR 6030; February 10, 1978) and in “A Unified National Program for Floodplain Management” prepared by the Federal Interagency Floodplain Management Taskforce (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA 248, June 1994). E.O. 11990—Protection of Wetlands (May 24, 1977) directs all Federal agencies to issue or amend existing procedures to ensure consideration of wetlands protection in decisionmaking and to ensure the evaluation of the potential impacts of any new construction proposed in a wetland.

      (b) It is the intent of the E.O.s that Federal agencies implement both the floodplain and the wetland provisions through existing procedures such as those established to implement the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 ). In those instances where the impacts of the proposed action are not significant enough to require the preparation of an EIS under section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, alternative floodplain or wetland evaluation procedures are to be established. As stated in the E.O.s, Federal agencies are to avoid direct or indirect support of development in a floodplain or new construction in a wetland wherever there is a practicable alternative.

      § 1022.2   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 1022.2

      (a) This part establishes policy and procedures for discharging the Department of Energy's (DOE's) responsibilities under E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990, including:

      (1) DOE policy regarding the consideration of floodplain and wetland factors in DOE planning and decisionmaking; and

      (2) DOE procedures for identifying proposed actions located in a floodplain or wetland, providing opportunity for early public review of such proposed actions, preparing floodplain or wetland assessments, and issuing statements of findings for actions in a floodplain.

      (b) To the extent possible, DOE shall accommodate the requirements of E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990 through applicable DOE NEPA procedures or, when appropriate, the environmental review process under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 ).

      § 1022.3   Policy.

#### § § 1022.3

      DOE shall exercise leadership and take action to:

      (a) Incorporate floodplain management goals and wetland protection considerations into its planning, regulatory, and decisionmaking processes, and shall to the extent practicable:

      (1) Reduce the risk of flood loss;

      (2) Minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health, and welfare;

      (3) Restore and preserve natural and beneficial values served by floodplains;

      (4) Require the construction of DOE structures and facilities to be, at a minimum, in accordance with FEMA National Flood Insurance Program building standards;

      (5) Promote public awareness of flood hazards by providing conspicuous delineations of past and probable flood heights on DOE property that has suffered flood damage or is in an identified floodplain and that is used by the general public;

      (6) Inform parties during transactions guaranteed, approved, regulated, or insured by DOE of the hazards associated with locating facilities and structures in a floodplain;

      (7) Minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands; and

      (8) Preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands.

      (b) Undertake a careful evaluation of the potential effects of any proposed floodplain or wetland action.

      (c) Avoid to the extent possible the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction of wetlands and the occupancy and modification of floodplains and wetlands, and avoid direct and indirect support of development in a floodplain or new construction in a wetland wherever there is a practicable alternative.

      (d) Identify, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement alternative actions that may avoid or mitigate adverse floodplain or wetland impacts.

      (e) Provide opportunity for early public review of any plans or proposals for floodplain or wetland actions.

      § 1022.4   Definitions.

      means the lowlands adjoining inland and coastal waters and relatively flat areas and floodprone areas of offshore islands.

      means any DOE action that takes place in a floodplain, including any DOE action in a wetland that is also within the floodplain, subject to the exclusions specified at § 1022.5(c) and (d) of this part.

      the qualities of or functions served by floodplains and wetlands that can include, but are not limited to, living values ( conservation of existing flora and fauna including their long-term productivity, preservation of diversity and stability of species and habitats), cultural resource values ( archeological and historic sites), cultivated resource values ( agriculture, aquaculture, forestry), aesthetic values ( natural beauty), and other values related to uses in the public interest ( open space, scientific study, outdoor education, recreation).

      means an evaluation consisting of a description of a proposed action, a discussion of its potential effects on the floodplain or wetland, and consideration of alternatives.

      means a brief document issued pursuant to § 1022.14 of this part that describes the results of a floodplain assessment.

      means those portions of riverine and coastal floodplains nearest the source of flooding that are frequently flooded and where the likelihood of flood losses and adverse impacts on the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains is greatest.

      means to reduce to the smallest degree practicable.

      means to prevent modification to the natural floodplain or wetland environment or to maintain it as closely as possible to its natural state.

      means to reestablish a setting or environment in which the natural functions of the floodplain or wetland can again operate.

      means a walled or roofed building, including mobile homes and gas or liquid storage tanks.

      means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

      means any DOE action related to new construction that takes place in a wetland not located in a floodplain, subject to the exclusions specified at § 1022.5(c) and (d) of this part.

      § 1022.5   Applicability.

#### § § 1022.5

      (a) This part applies to all organizational units of DOE, including the National Nuclear Security Administration, except that it shall not apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

      (b) This part applies to all proposed floodplain or wetland actions, including those sponsored jointly with other agencies.

      (4) U.S. Geological Survey Topographic Maps; and

      (5) DOE environmental documents,  NEPA and CERCLA documents.

      (d) Pursuant to § 1022.5 of this part and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, DOE shall prepare:

      (1) A floodplain assessment for any proposed floodplain action in the base floodplain or for any proposed floodplain action that is a critical action located in the critical action floodplain; or

      (2) A wetland assessment for any proposed wetland action.

      § 1022.12   Notice of proposed action.

#### § § 1022.12

      (a) For a proposed floodplain or wetland action for which an EIS is required, DOE shall use applicable NEPA procedures to provide the opportunity for early public review of the proposed action. A notice of intent to prepare the EIS may be used to satisfy the requirement for DOE to publish a notice of proposed floodplain or wetland action.

      (b) For a proposed floodplain or wetland action for which no EIS is required, DOE shall take appropriate steps to send a notice of proposed floodplain or wetland action to appropriate government agencies ( FEMA regional offices, host and affected States, and tribal and local governments) and to persons or groups known to be interested in or potentially affected by the proposed floodplain or wetland action. DOE also shall distribute the notice in the area where the proposed action is to be located ( by publication in local newspapers, through public service announcements, by posting on- and off-site). In addition, for a proposed floodplain or wetland action that may result in effects of national concern to the floodplain or wetland or both, DOE shall publish the notice in the

      § 1022.13   Floodplain or wetland assessment.

#### § § 1022.13

      (a) A floodplain or wetland assessment shall contain the following information:

      (1)  This section shall describe the proposed action and shall include a map showing its location with respect to the floodplain and/or wetland. For actions located in a floodplain, the nature and extent of the flood hazard shall be described, including the nature and extent of hazards associated with any high-hazard areas.

      (2)  This section shall discuss the positive and negative, direct and indirect, and long- and short-term effects of the proposed action on the floodplain and/or wetland. This section shall include impacts on the natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values (§ 1022.4) appropriate to the location under evaluation. In addition, the effects of a proposed floodplain action on lives and property shall be evaluated. For an action proposed in a wetland, the effects on the survival, quality, and function of the wetland shall be evaluated.

      (3)  DOE shall consider alternatives to the proposed action that avoid adverse impacts and incompatible development in the floodplain and/or wetland, including alternate sites, alternate actions, and no action. DOE shall evaluate measures that mitigate the adverse effects of actions in a floodplain and/or wetland including, but not limited to, minimum grading requirements, runoff controls, design and construction constraints, and protection of ecologically-sensitive areas.

      (b) For proposed floodplain or wetland actions for which an EA or EIS is required, DOE shall prepare the floodplain or wetland assessment concurrent with and included in the appropriate NEPA document.

      (c) For floodplain or wetland actions for which neither an EA nor an EIS is prepared, DOE shall prepare the floodplain or wetland assessment separately or incorporate it when appropriate into another environmental review process ( CERCLA).

      § 1022.14   Findings.

#### § § 1022.14

      (a) If DOE finds that no practicable alternative to locating or conducting the action in the floodplain or wetland is available, then before taking action DOE shall design or modify its action in order to minimize potential harm to or within the floodplain or wetland, consistent with the policies set forth in E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990.

      (b) For actions that will be located in a floodplain, DOE shall issue a floodplain statement of findings, normally not to exceed three pages, that contains:

      (1) A brief description of the proposed action, including a location map;

      (2) An explanation indicating why the action is proposed to be located in the floodplain;

      (3) A list of alternatives considered;

      (4) A statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable floodplain protection standards; and

      (5) A brief description of steps to be taken to minimize potential harm to or within the floodplain.

      (c) For floodplain actions that require preparation of an EA or EIS, DOE may incorporate the floodplain statement of findings into the finding of no significant impact or final EIS, as appropriate, or issue such statement separately.

      (d) DOE shall send copies of the floodplain statement of findings to appropriate government agencies ( FEMA regional offices, host and affected states, and tribal and local governments) and to others who submitted comments on the proposed floodplain action.

      (e) For proposed floodplain actions that may result in effects of national concern, DOE shall publish the floodplain statement of findings in the  describing the location of the action and stating where a map is available.

      (f) For floodplain actions subject to E.O. 12372—Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (July 14, 1982), DOE also shall send the floodplain statement of findings to the State in accordance with 10 CFR part 1005—Intergovernmental Review of Department of Energy Programs and Activities.

      § 1022.15   Timing.

#### § § 1022.15

      (a) For a proposed floodplain action, DOE shall allow 15 days for public comment following issuance of a notice of proposed floodplain action. After the close of the public comment period and before issuing a floodplain statement of findings, DOE shall reevaluate the practicability of alternatives to the proposed floodplain action and the mitigating measures, taking into account all substantive comments received. After issuing a floodplain statement of findings, DOE shall endeavor to allow at least 15 days of public review before implementing a proposed floodplain action. If a  notice is required, the 15-day period begins on the date of publication in the

      (b) For a proposed wetland action, DOE shall allow 15 days for public comment following issuance of a notice of proposed wetland action. After the close of the public comment period, DOE shall reevaluate the practicability of alternatives to the proposed wetland action and the mitigating measures, taking into account all substantive comments received, before implementing a proposed wetland action. If a  notice is required, the 15-day period begins on the date of publication in the

      § 1022.16   Variances.

#### § § 1022.16

      (a)  DOE may take actions without observing all provisions of this part in emergency situations that demand immediate action. To the extent practicable prior to taking an emergency action (or as soon as possible after taking such an action) DOE shall document the emergency actions in accordance with NEPA procedures at 10 CFR 1021.343(a) or CERCLA procedures in order to identify any adverse impacts from the actions taken and any further necessary mitigation.

      (b)  If statutory deadlines or overriding considerations of program or project expense or effectiveness exist, DOE may waive the minimum time periods in § 1022.15 of this subpart.

      (c)  To the extent practicable prior to taking an action pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section (or as soon as possible after taking such an action) the cognizant DOE program or project manager shall consult with the Office of NEPA Policy and Compliance.

      § 1040.4   Assurances required and preaward review.

#### § § 1040.4

      (a)  An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance on a form specified by the Director that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with applicable subparts. Such assurances are to include provisions which give the United States a right to seek judicial enforcement.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structure on the property, the assurance obligates the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

      (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance obligates the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

      (3) In all other cases, the assurance obligates the recipient to all terms and conditions contained in the certificate of assurance for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

      (c)  Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property, structures, improvements on or interests in the property, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest in the property from the Department:

      (1) The instrument effecting or recording this transfer is to contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits; or

      (2) Where no transfer of property is involved or imposed with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.

      (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant is to also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a material breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property manages to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new or improvement of existing facilities on the property for the purpose for which the property was transferred, the Director may, upon request of the transferee and, if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions, as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of the right to revert title for so long as the lien of the mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

      (d)  In the case of any application from any department, agency or office of any State or local government for Federal financial assistance for any specified purpose, the assurance required by this section is to extend to any other department, agency, or office of the same governmental unit.

      (f)  Any State or State agency applying for continuing Federal financial assistance subject to this part shall, as a condition for the extension of such assistance:

      (1) Provide a statement that the program or activity is (or, in the case of a new program or activity, will be) conducted in compliance with applicable subparts; and

      (2) Provide for such methods of administration as are found by the Director or a designee to give reasonable assurance that the primary recipient and all other recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with this part.

      (g)  Where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility, or a part of a facility, the assurance is to extend to the entire facility. If a facility to be constructed is part of a larger system, the assurance is to extend to the larger system.

      (h)  Prior to and as a condition of approval, all applications for Federal financial assistance are to be reviewed by the appropriate Civil Rights Department official who is to make a written determination of the applicant's compliance with this part. The basis for such a determination is to be the submission of the assurance of compliance as specified in paragraph (a) and a review of data to be submitted by the applicant as specified by the Director. For purposes of this subsection, the appropriate departmental official at headquarters level is the Director, FAPD, Office of Equal Opportunity, and at the regional level it is to be the Civil Rights Officer delegated by the Director as having review authority for determining compliance with requirements of this part. Where a determination of compliance cannot be made from this data, DOE may require the applicant to submit necessary additional information and may take other steps necessary to make the determination of compliance. Such other steps may include, for example, communicating with local government officials or protected class organizations and field reviews. Any agreement to achieve voluntary compliance as a result of a preaward review shall be in writing. In the case of Title VI, the Director will notify the Assistant Attorney General of instances of probable noncompliance determined as the result of application reviews. The opportunity for a hearing as provided under § 1040.113 is applicable to this section.

      (c) A recipient, in determining the type of Federal financial assistance (i.e., disposition, services, financial aid, benefits, or facilities) which will be provided under any program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which the assistance will be provided, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, national origin, or sex (when covered by section 16 and section 401) or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, national origin, or sex (when covered by section 16 or section 401).

      (d) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination because of race, color, national origin, or sex (when covered by section 16 or 401) or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of title VI or this subpart.

      (e) For the purpose of this section, the disposition, services, financial aid, or benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance include all portions of the recipient's program or activity, including facilities, equipment, or property provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.

      (f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph and in § 1040.14 of this subpart does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (g)  Exclusion from benefits for protected groups. An individual is not to be considered subjected to discrimination by reason of his/her exclusion from benefits limited to individuals of a particular race, color, national origin or sex different from his/hers when the exclusion is provided for or required by Federal law, for example, Federal financial assistance provided exclusively to serve on-reservation Indians.

      § 1040.14   Covered employment.

#### § § 1040.14

      (a)  (1) Whenever a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a recipient of the assistance may not (directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subject any individual to discrimination on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or sex (when covered by section 16 and section 401) in its employment practices under the program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff, or termination, upgrading, demotion or transfer, training, participation in upward mobility projects, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities). This prohibition also applies to programs where the primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is:

      (i) To assist individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training;

      (ii) To provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of the individuals involved;

      (iii) To reduce the unemployment of individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs; or

      (iv) To provide employment to individuals who, because of handicaps, cannot be readily absorbed in the competitive labor market. The requirements applicable to construction under any such program are to be those specified in or under part III of Executive Order 11246, as amended, or any Executive Order which supersedes it.

      (2) In regard to Federal financial assistance which does not have provision of employment as a primary objective, the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the recipient if discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, or sex (when covered by section 16 or section 401) in such employment practices tends to exclude persons from participation in, deny them the benefits of, or subject them to discrimination under the program receiving Federal financial assistance. In any such case, the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of beneficiaries.

      (3) Paragraph (a)(1) also applies to covered employment as defined in § 1040.12(a)(2).

      (b) Enforcement of title VI compliance with respect to covered employment practices is not to be superseded by State or local merit systems relating to the employment practices of the same recipient.

        (b)  (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap—

        (i) Deny a qualified person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit or service;

        (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

        (iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;

        (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is provided to others unless the action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

        (v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or services to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;

        (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.

        (3) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different aid, benefits, or services, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different.

        (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration that:

        (i) Have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap;

        (ii) Have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons; or

        (iii) Perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same state.

        (5) In determining the site of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections that—

#### § § 1040.64

        (a) The obligation to comply with this subpart is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.

        (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for handicapped persons than for non-handicapped persons.

        (c)  All regulations, orders, or similar directions issued by any officer of DOE which impose requirements designed to prohibit discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, national origin, sex, age or handicap under any program or activity to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension, termination or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance for failure to comply with these requirements, are superseded to the extent that discrimination is prohibited by this part. Nothing in this part is to relieve any person of the obligation assumed or imposed under any superseded regulation, order, instruction, or similar direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part is to supersede the effective date of this part.

        (3) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeships.

        § 1040.67   Reasonable accommodation.

#### § § 1040.67

        (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program or activity.

        (b) Reasonable accommodation may include:

        (1) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; and

        (2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.

        (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and

        (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.

#### § § 1040.68

        (a) A recipient may not use any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped persons unless the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question.

        (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment to best ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude or other factors the test purports to measure except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct a pre-employment medical examination or may not make pre-employment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make pre-employment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.

        (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination, under § 1040.7 of this part, or is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity under § 1040.7 of subpart A of this part, or when a recipient is taking affirmative action under Sec. 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether, and to what extent, they are handicapped

        (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and

        (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this subpart.

        (c) Nothing in this section is to prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty provided that all entering employees are subjected to the examination regardless of handicap or absence of handicap and results of the examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

        (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section concerning the medical condition or history of the applicant is to be collected and maintained on separate forms that are to be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:

        (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary accommodations;

      Accessibility

        § 1040.71   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1040.71

        § 1040.72   Existing facilities.

#### § § 1040.72

        (a)  A recipient shall operate any program or activity to which this subpart applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and useable by handicapped persons.

        (b)  A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 1040.73 or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

        (c)  A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, the changes are to be made as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than three years after the effective date of this subpart.

        (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within 6 months of the effective date of this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete the changes. The plan is to be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan is to meet with the approval of the Director, Federally Assisted Programs Division, Office of Equal Opportunity, DOE. A copy of the transition plan is to be made available for public inspection. At a minimum, the plan is to:

        (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility to and usability by handicapped persons of its program or activity.

        (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

        (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under § 1040.72(a) and, if the time period or the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

        (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.

        (e)  The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to, and useable by, handicapped persons.

#### § § 1040.73

        (a)  Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient is to be designed and constructed in a manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to, and useable by, handicapped persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this subpart.

        (b)  Each facility or part of a facility which is altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date of this subpart in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility is, to the maximum extent feasible, to be altered in a manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and useable by handicapped persons.

        (c)  (1) Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.

        (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.

        (3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

        § 1040.74   Accessibility in historic properties.

#### § § 1040.74

        (a)  Recipients shall operate each program or activity involving historic properties so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The recipient shall exhaust subsection (b)(1) (methods to accomplish accessibility without building alterations or structural changes) before proceeding to subsection (b)(2) (methods to accomplish program accessibility resulting in building alterations). The recipient shall exhaust subsection (b)(2) (methods to accomplish accessibility resulting in building alterations) before proceeding to subsection (b)(3) (methods to accomplish accessibility resulting in structural changes).

        (1)  The recipient shall investigate compliance methods which do not alter the historic character or architectural integrity of the property and shall utilize such methods unless such methods are ineffective in achieving accessibility. Such methods may include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Reassigning aid, benefits, or services to accessible locations within the facility.

        (ii) Assigning persons to aid handicapped persons into or through an otherwise inaccessible facility.

        (iii) Delivering aid, benefits, or services at alternative accessible sites operated by or available for such use by the recipient.

        (iv) Adopting other innovative methods which make aid, benefits, or services accessible to the handicapped.

        (2)  The recipient shall determine that accessibility cannot feasibly be accomplished by Methods to Accomplish Accessibility without Building Alterations or Structural Changes, subsection (b)(1) prior to utilizing building alteration as a method of accomplishing program accessibility. Alterations must comply with the accessibility standards adopted in these regulations. Building alterations shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy historically, architecturally, or culturally significant elements or features.

        (3)  The recipient shall determine that accessibility cannot feasibly be accomplished by Methods to Accomplish Accessibility without Building Alterations or Structural Changes, subsection (b)(2) before considering structural changes as a method of accomplishing program accessibility. Structural changes must comply with the accessibility standards adopted in these regulations. Structural changes shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy historically, architecturally or culturally significant elements or features.

        (b)  The applicability of the accessibility standards set forth in these regulations may be modified or waived on a case-by-case basis, upon application to the Director, FAPD, where the recipient can demonstrate that, because of the nature of the activity, the provision of access would be infeasible or would substantially impair the historic, architectural or cultural integrity of the historic property.

#### § § 1040.84

        The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions contained in § 1040.86 and of these regulations.

        (a)  No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

        (b)  A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements use age distinctions or take any other actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:

        (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or

        (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

        (3) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.

        § 1040.85   Definitions of “Normal Operation” and “Statutory Objective”.

#### § § 1040.85

        For purpose of §§ 1040.86 and 1040.87, the terms  and  shall have the following meanings:

        (a)  means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.

        (b)  means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal, State, or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.

        § 1040.86   Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination. Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.

#### § § 1040.86

        A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 1040.84, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation of a program or activity if:

        (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics;

        (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity;

        (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

        (d) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.

        § 1040.87   Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination. Reasonable factors other than age.

#### § § 1040.87

        A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1040.84 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

        § 1040.88   Remedial and affirmative action by recipients.

#### § § 1040.88

        (a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take such remedial action as the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, considers necessary to overcome the effects of the discrimination.

        (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.

        (c) If a recipient operating a program or activity which serves the elderly or children, in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from participation in the program or activity.

A complainant must file a complaint within 180 days from the date he/she first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. For good cause shown, however, the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, may extend the time limit for filing a complaint. Complaints may be submitted to Field Civil Rights Officers located in DOE's field offices or to the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20585.

        (b) The Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:

        (2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.

        (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at least one meeting with the mediator before the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, will accept a judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

        (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, DOE. DOE will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.

        (d) DOE will use the mediation process for a maximum of 60 days after referring a complaint to mediation. Mediation ends if:

        (1) 60 days elapse from the time the mediation agency receives the complaint; or

        (2) Prior to the end of the 60 day mediation period, an agreement is reached; or

        (3) Prior to the end of that 60 day mediation period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached.

        § 1040.89-7   Investigation.

#### § § 1040.89-7

        (a)  (1) The Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, will review complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement.

        (2) As part of this review, Field Civil Rights Officers will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties.

        (3) If the complaint is resolved during the informal investigation, DOE will put the agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity.

        (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of DOE, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.

        (5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

        (b)  If Field Civil Rights Officers cannot resolve the complaint through informal inquiry, the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, will assign an Investigator to conduct a formal investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, DOE will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance.

        § 1040.89-8   Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

#### § § 1040.89-8

        A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation against any person who:

        (a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or these regulations; or

        (b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, or other part of DOE's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.

        § 1040.89-9   Compliance procedure.

#### § § 1040.89-9

        (a) DOE may enforce the Act and these regulations through procedures precribed in subpart H of DOE regulation 10 CFR part 1040—Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs or Activities, which calls for—

        (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from DOE for a program activity in which the recipient has violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from DOE under this section.

        (2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:

        (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations, or under the terms of the Federal financial assistance.

        (ii) Use of any requirement of, or referral to, any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act of these regulations.

        (b) DOE will limit any termination under § 1040.89-9(a)(1) to the particular recipient and particular program or activity DOE finds in violation of these regulations. DOE will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from DOE.

        (c) DOE will take no action under paragraph (a) until:

        (1) The Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act, these regulations, or the terms of the Federal financial assistance and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

        (2) Thirty (30) days have elapsed after the Secretary or the Secretary's designee has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Secretary will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) DOE also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when a hearing under § 1040.89-10 is initiated.

        (1) New Federal financial assistance from DOE includes all assistance for which DOE requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from DOE does not include increases in funding as a result of changes, computation of formula awards, or assistance awarded prior to the beginning of a hearing under § 1040.89-10.

        (2) DOE will not defer new assistance until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 1040.89-10. DOE will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and FERC. DOE will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing resulted in a finding against the recipient.

        (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and

        (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action for injunctive relief; and

        (3) Inform the complainant:

        (i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States District Court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;

        (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;

        (iii) That, before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 30 days notice, by registered mail, to the Secretary of DOE, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;

        (iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act and these regulations; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not attorney fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

        (v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

      (a) The Director shall periodically conduct compliance reviews of selected recipients of DOE Federal financial assistance.

      (b) The Director shall seek to review those recipients which have the most serious equal opportunity problems which cause the greatest disparity in delivery of services on a nondiscriminatory basis. Selection for review is to be made on the basis of the following criteria, among others:

      (1) The relative disparity between the percentage of minorities, women, or handicapped persons, in the relevant labor market, and the percentage of minorities, women, or handicapped persons, employed by the recipient if employment practices are covered by this part;

      (b)  Each recipient shall keep reports and submit to the responsible Department official or his/her designee, timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at the times, in such form, and containing information as the responsible Department official or the designee may determine to be necessary to enable him/her to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In general, recipients should have available for DOE data on program participants, identified by race, color, national origin, sex, age and handicap status. In the case of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient or subcontracts with any other person or group, such other recipient shall also submit compliance reports to the primary recipient which will enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

      (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible Department official or his/her designee during normal business hours to books, records, personnel records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities, which are pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. The requirement for access to sources of information shall be contained in the certificate of assurance and agreed to by the recipient as a condition to award. Whenever any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person and that agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish that information, the recipient shall certify this in its report and set forth the efforts which it has made to obtain the information.

#### § § 1040.104

      (a) The Director, FAPD, shall investigate complaints of discrimination that allege a violation of—

      (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sec. 16 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, as amended, or Sec. 401 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974;

      (2) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended;

      (3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended;

      (4) Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, (reserved in this part);

      (6) This part; and

      (7) Civil rights provisions of statutes administered pursuant to the DOE Organization Act, Pub. L. 95-91.

      (b) No complaint will be investigated if it is received by an appropriate Departmental official more than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Director, FAPD, for good cause shown. Where a complaint is accepted for investigation, the Director, FAPD, will initiate a DOE investigation. The Director, FAPD, who is responsible for the investigation, shall notify the complainant, in writing, if the complaint has been accepted or rejected.

      (c) The Director, FAPD, or his/her designee shall conduct investigations of complaints as follows:

      (1) Within 35 days of receipt of a complaint, the Director, FAPD, shall:

      (i) determine whether DOE has jurisdiction under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;

      (ii) If jurisdiction is not found, wherever possible, refer the complaint to the Federal agency with such jurisdiction and advise the complainant;

      (iii) If jurisdiction is found, notify the recipient alleged to be discriminating of receipt of the complaint; and

      (iv) Initiate the investigation.

      (2) The investigation will ordinarily be initiated by a letter requesting data pertinent to the complaint and advising the recipient of:

      (i) The nature of the complaint and, with the written consent of the complainant, the identity of the complainant. The identity of the complainant may be revealed by the Director, FAPD, OEO, without the complainant's written consent if the Director, FAPD, OEO, determines that such action is necessary for resolution of the complaint;

      (ii) The program or activities affected by the complaint;

      (iii) The opportunity to make, at any time prior to receipt of DOE's findings, a documentary submission responding to, rebutting, or denying the allegations made in the complaint; and

      (iv) The schedule under which the complaint will be investigated and a determination of compliance made.

      (3) Within 90 days of initiating the investigation, the Director, FAPD, shall advise the recipient, in writing of:

      (i) Preliminary findings;

      (ii) Where appropriate, recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance; and

      (iii) The opportunity to request DOE to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations prior to the Director's final determination of compliance or noncompliance. The Director or the Director's designee shall notify the Assistant Attorney General and the recipient of any matter where recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance are made.

      (4) If, within 45 days of the recipient's notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Director's (FAPD) recommendations for compliance are not met, or voluntary compliance is not secured, or the preliminary findings are not shown to be false, the matter will be forwarded to the Director, OEO, for a determination of compliance or noncompliance. The determination is to be made no later than 60 days after the recipient has been notified of the preliminary findings. If the Director makes a determination of noncompliance, the Department shall institute actions specified in subpart H.

      (5) Where the Director makes a formal determination of noncompliance, the recipient and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately advised, in writing, of the determination and of the fact that the recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10 days, the Director shall institute proceedings under subpart H. All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by the Director, OEO, and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient. The complainant shall also be notified of any action taken including the closing of the complaint or achievement of voluntary compliance.

      (6) If the complainant or party other than the Attorney General has filed suit in Federal or State court alleging the same discrimination alleged in a complaint to DOE, and if during DOE's investigation, the trial of that suit would be in progress, DOE will consult with the Assistant Attorney General and court records to determine the need to continue or suspend the investigation and will monitor the litigation through the court docket and contacts with the complainant. Upon receipt of notice that the court has made a finding of discrimination against a recipient that would constitute a violation of this part, the DOE may institute administrative proceedings as specified in subpart H after DOE has advised the recipient, in writing, of an opportunity to request voluntary compliance under this section. All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by the Director and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.

      (7) The time limits listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section shall be appropriately adjusted where DOE requests another Federal agency to act on the complaint. DOE is to monitor the progress of the matter through liaison with the other agency. Where the request to act does not result in timely resolution of the matter, DOE is to institute appropriate proceedings as required by this part.

      (d)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by the laws implemented in this part or because the complainant has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subpart. The identity of complainants is to be kept confidential except as determined by the Director, FAPD, to be necessary to carry out the purpose of this subpart, including investigations, hearings, or judicial proceedings arising thereunder.

    § 1041.140   Employment.

#### § § 1041.140

#### § §§ 1041.141-1041.148

    § 1041.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1041.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1041.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1041.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1041.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1041.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.

      (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

      (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

      § 1042.130   Effect of employment opportunities.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 1042.135, or to the designated agency official.

      (d)  To overcome the effects of past exclusion of students on the basis of sex, each educational institution to which § 1042.225 applies shall include in its transition plan, and shall implement, specific steps designed to encourage individuals of the previously excluded sex to apply for admission to such institution. Such steps shall include instituting recruitment programs that emphasize the institution's commitment to enrolling students of the sex previously excluded.

      § 1042.235   Statutory amendments.

#### § § 1042.235

      (a) This section, which applies to all provisions of these Title IX regulations, addresses statutory amendments to Title IX.

      (1) Any program or activity of the American Legion undertaken in connection with the organization or operation of any Boys State conference, Boys Nation conference, Girls State conference, or Girls Nation conference;

      (2) Any program or activity of a secondary school or educational institution specifically for:

      (i) The promotion of any Boys State conference, Boys Nation conference, Girls State conference, or Girls Nation conference; or

      (ii) The selection of students to attend any such conference;

      (3) Father-son or mother-daughter activities at an educational institution or in an education program or activity, but if such activities are provided for students of one sex, opportunities for reasonably comparable activities shall be provided to students of the other sex;

      (4) Any scholarship or other financial assistance awarded by an institution of higher education to an individual because such individual has received such award in a single-sex pageant based upon a combination of factors related to the individual's personal appearance, poise, and talent. The pageant, however, must comply with other nondiscrimination provisions of Federal law.

      (c)  or  means:

      (1) All of the operations of any entity described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance:

      (i)(A) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or

      (B) The entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government;

      (B) A local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of title 20), system of vocational education, or other school system;

      (iii)(A) An entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, or an entire sole proprietorship—

      (B) The entire plant or other comparable, geographically separate facility to which Federal financial assistance is extended, in the case of any other corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship; or

      (iv) Any other entity that is established by two or more of the entities described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.

#### § § 1042.300

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be denied admission, or be subjected to discrimination in admission, by any recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply, except as provided in §§ 1042.225 and 1042.230.

      (b)  (1) In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply shall not:

      (i) Give preference to one person over another on the basis of sex, by ranking applicants separately on such basis, or otherwise;

      (ii) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of persons of either sex who may be admitted; or

      (iii) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the basis of sex.

      (2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission that has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria that do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.

      (c)  In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply:

      (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;

      (2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice that so discriminates or excludes;

      (3) Subject to § 1042.235(d), shall treat disabilities related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or physical condition; and

      § 1042.305   Preference in admission.

#### § § 1042.305

      A recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310.

      § 1042.310   Recruitment.

#### § § 1042.310

      (a)  A recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and admission of students.

      (b)  A recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 apply shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at educational institutions, schools, or entities that admit as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310.

    Subpart D—Discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited

      § 1042.400   Education programs or activities.

Sections 1042.400 through 1042.455 do not apply to actions of a recipient in connection with admission of its students to an education program or activity of a recipient to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 do not apply, or an entity, not a recipient, to which §§ 1042.300 through 1042.310 would not apply if the entity were a recipient.

      (b)  Except as provided in §§ 1042.400 through 1042.455, in providing any aid, benefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis of sex:

      (5) Apply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a student or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition;

      (6) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students or employees;

      (7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.

      (c)  A recipient educational institution may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other awards established by foreign or domestic wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments and restricted to members of one sex, that are designed to provide opportunities to study abroad, and that are awarded to students who are already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient institution;  that a recipient educational institution that administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, fellowships, or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex provides, or otherwise makes available, reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other sex. Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.

      (d)  (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.

      (2) Such recipient:

      (i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such recipient from taking; and

      (ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such participation if such action occurs.

      § 1042.405   Housing.

#### § § 1042.405

      (a)  A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, apply different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, or offer different services or benefits related to housing, except as provided in this section (including housing provided only to married students).

      (b)  (1) A recipient may provide separate housing on the basis of sex.

      (2) Housing provided by a recipient to students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, shall be as a whole:

      (i) Proportionate in quantity to the number of students of that sex applying for such housing; and

      (ii) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.

      (A) Proportionate in quantity; and

      (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.

      (ii) A recipient may render such assistance to any agency, organization, or person that provides all or part of such housing to students of only one sex.

      § 1042.410   Comparable facilities.

#### § § 1042.410

      A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.

      § 1042.415   Access to course offerings.

#### § § 1042.415

      (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.

      (b)(1) With respect to classes and activities in physical education at the elementary school level, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from February 20, 2001. With respect to physical education classes and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from February 20, 2001.

      (2) This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex.

      (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (4) Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such effect.

      (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.

      (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.

      § 1042.420   Access to schools operated by LEAs.

#### § § 1042.420

      § 1042.425   Counseling and use of appraisal and counseling materials.

#### § § 1042.425

      (a)  A recipient shall not discriminate against any person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or applicants for admission.

      (b)  A recipient that uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

      (c)  Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.

      § 1042.430   Financial assistance.

#### § § 1042.430

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in providing financial assistance to any of its students, a recipient shall not:

      (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex; or

      (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.

      (b)  (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein;  that the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.

      (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:

      (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;

      (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

      (c)  (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.

      (a)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to any of its students:

      (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and

      (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.

      (b)  A recipient that employs any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates §§ 1042.500 through 1042.550.

      § 1042.440   Health and insurance benefits and services.

#### § § 1042.440

      Subject to § 1042.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would violate §§ 1042.500 through 1042.550 if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services.

      (b)  (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.

      (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

      (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

      (4) Subject to § 1042.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

      (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

      § 1042.450   Athletics.

#### § § 1042.450

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

      (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

      (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

      (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

      (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;

      (iv) Travel and per diem allowance;

      (v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;

      (vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;

      (vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;

      (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

      (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

      (x) Publicity.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

      (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from February 20, 2001. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or post-secondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from February 20, 2001.

      § 1042.455   Textbooks and curricular material.

      (2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that could adversely affect any applicant's or employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.

      (3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by §§ 1042.500 through 1042.550, including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient.

      (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of these Title IX regulations.

      (b)  The provisions of §§ 1042.500 through 1042.550 apply to:

      (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the process of application for employment;

      (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, application of nepotism policies, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;

      § 1042.505   Employment criteria.

#### § § 1042.505

      A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for any employment opportunity that has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:

      (a) Use of such test or other criterion is shown to predict validly successful performance in the position in question; and

      (b) Alternative tests or criteria for such purpose, which do not have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be unavailable.

      § 1042.510   Recruitment.

#### § § 1042.510

      (a)  A recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of employees, or has been found to have so discriminated in the past, the recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.

      (b)  A recipient shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at entities that furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 1042.500 through 1042.550.

      § 1045.50   [Reserved]

#### § § 1045.50

      § 1045.55   When are RD, FRD, and TFNI considered for declassification?

#### § § 1045.55

      RD, FRD, and TFNI information and matter are considered for declassification during several processes.

      (a) DOE reviews all classification guides containing RD, FRD, or TFNI topics at least once every 5 years to determine if information identified as RD, FRD, or TFNI still meets the criteria for classification under § 1045.70. If RD, FRD, and TFNI information contained in a classification guide does not meet the standards for classification, the information is declassified.

      (b) TFNI is no longer TFNI when comparable U.S. RD is declassified.

      (c) Agencies with holdings containing RD, FRD, or TFNI should periodically review holdings that are likely to have a high degree of public interest and a likelihood of declassification. If any matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is identified for declassification, agencies must coordinate the declassification of matter marked as RD, FRD, or TFNI with DOE or DoD, as appropriate.

      (d) RD, FRD, or TFNI information or matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI in particular areas of public interest may be considered for declassification if sufficient interest is demonstrated. Proposals for the systematic review of given collections or subject areas must be addressed to the Director, Office of Classification, EHSS-60/Germantown Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585.

      (e) During the FOIA and MDR request process, agencies must refer any responsive matter that is marked as or potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI to DOE or DoD, as provided under Subpart F. During this process, the information may be reviewed to determine it still meets the standards for classification.

      (f) The public and persons with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI may submit a declassification proposal for RD, FRD, or TFNI under § 1045.105.

> [83 FR 66007, Dec. 21, 2018, as amended at 88 FR 41294, June 26, 2023]

      § 1045.60   Does an unauthorized public release of RD, FRD, or TFNI result in its declassification?

#### § § 1045.60

      The unauthorized disclosure of RD, FRD, or TFNI does not automatically result in its declassification. However, if a disclosure is sufficiently authoritative or credible, the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security will examine the possibility of declassifying the information.

> [83 FR 66007, Dec. 21, 2018, as amended at 88 FR 41294, June 26, 2023]

      § 1045.65   What are the responsibilities of a person with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI, if they see information in the open literature that they think is RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.65

      (a) A person with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI, must not confirm or expand upon the classification status or technical accuracy of information in the open literature that is RD, FRD, or TFNI or suspected to be RD, FRD, or TFNI. Commenting on such information can cause greater damage to national security by confirming its location, classified nature, or technical accuracy.

      (b) Because the open literature may contain information that is still classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI, a person who has access to RD, FRD, or TFNI who incorporates information from the open literature that is potentially classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI into matter must ensure the matter is reviewed as required under § 1045.125 to ensure the information incorporated is not classified.

    Subpart C—Determining if Information is RD, FRD, or TFNI

      § 1045.70   How is information initially determined to be RD?

#### § § 1045.70

      (a) For new information to be classified as RD it must fall under the definition of RD that states such information concerns: The design, manufacture, or utilization of nuclear weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, and the unauthorized release of the information must reasonably be expected to cause undue risk to the common defense and security.

      (b) This initial determination is made by the Director, Office of Classification after:

      (1) Ensuring the information is not prohibited from being classified under § 1045.75;

      (2) Considering whether the information falls within the classification or declassification presumptions in § 1045.80; and

      (3) Evaluating the criteria in this paragraph.

      (i) Whether the information is so widely known or readily apparent to knowledgeable observers that its classification would cast doubt on the credibility of classification programs;

      (ii) Whether publication of the information would assist in the development of countermeasures or otherwise jeopardize any U.S. weapon or weapon system;

      (iii) Whether the information would hinder U.S. nonproliferation efforts by significantly assisting potential adversaries to develop or improve a nuclear weapon capability, produce nuclear weapons materials, or make other military use of nuclear energy;

      (iv) Whether information would assist terrorists to develop a nuclear weapon, produce nuclear materials, or use special nuclear material in a terrorist attack;

      (v) Whether publication of the information would have a detrimental effect on U.S. foreign relations;

      (vi) Whether publication of the information would benefit the public welfare, taking into account the importance of the information to public discussion and education and potential contribution to economic growth; and

      (vii) Whether publication of the information would benefit the operation of any Government program by reducing operating costs or improving public acceptance.

      (c) In consideration of the analysis of the criteria of this section, if there is significant doubt about the need to classify the information, then the Director cannot make an initial determination to classify the information.

      § 1045.75   Are there prohibitions against information being classified, remaining classified, or prevented from being declassified as RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.75

      (a) Yes. Information must not be classified or remain classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Persons must also not prevent information from being declassified as RD, FRD, or TFNI for the purposes described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.

      (b) Conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;

      (c) Prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;

      (d) Restrain competition;

      (e) Prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection for the national security or nonproliferation reasons;

      (f) Unduly restrict dissemination by assigning an improper classification level; or

      (g) Prevent or delay the release of information bearing solely on the physical environment or public or worker health and safety.

      § 1045.80   What are the classification and declassification presumptions?

#### § § 1045.80

      (a) The Director, Office of Classification and the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security consider the presumptions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section before applying the criteria in § 1045.70. These presumptions concern information in certain but not all nuclear-related areas that may generally be presumed to be RD or are generally unclassified. The term “generally” here means that as a rule, but not necessarily in every case, the information in the identified area is presumed classified or not classified as indicated. Inclusion of specific existing information in one of the presumption categories does not mean that new information in a category is or is not classified, but only that arguments to differ from the presumed classification status of the information should use the appropriate presumption as a starting point.

      (b) Information in the following areas is presumed to be RD:

      (1) Detailed designs, specifications, and functional descriptions of nuclear explosives, whether in the active stockpile or retired;

      (2) Material properties under conditions achieved in nuclear explosions that are principally useful only for design and analysis of nuclear weapons;

      (3) Vulnerabilities of U.S. nuclear weapons to sabotage, countermeasures, or unauthorized use;

      (4) Nuclear weapons logistics and operational performance information ( specific weapon deployments, yields, capabilities) related to military utilization of those weapons required by DoD;

      (5) Details of the critical steps or components in nuclear material production processes; and

      (6) Features of military nuclear reactors, especially naval nuclear propulsion reactors, that are not common to or required for civilian power reactors.

      (c) Information in the following areas is presumed to be unclassified:

      (1) Basic science: Mathematics, chemistry, theoretical and experimental physics, engineering, materials science, biology, and medicine;

      (2) Magnetic confinement fusion technology;

      (3) Civilian power reactors, including nuclear fuel cycle information but excluding technologies for uranium enrichment;

      (4) Source materials (defined as uranium and thorium and ores containing them);

      (5) Fact of use of safety features ( insensitive high explosives, fire resistant pits) to lower the risks and reduce the consequences of nuclear weapon accidents;

      (6) Generic nuclear weapons effects;

      (7) Physical and chemical properties of uranium and plutonium, most of their alloys and compounds, under standard temperature and pressure conditions;

      (8) Nuclear fuel reprocessing technology and reactor products not revealing classified production rates or inventories;

      (9) The fact, time, location, and yield range ( “less than 20 kilotons” or “20-150 kilotons”) of U.S. nuclear tests;

      (10) General descriptions of nuclear material production processes and theory of operation;

      (11) DOE special nuclear material aggregate inventories and production rates not revealing the size of or details concerning the nuclear weapons stockpile;

      (12) Types of waste products resulting from all DOE weapon and material production operations;

      (13) Any information solely relating to the public and worker health and safety or to environmental quality; and

      (14) The simple association or simple presence of any material ( element, compound, isotope, alloy, etc.) at a specified DOE site.

      § 1045.85   How is information determined to be FRD or TFNI and can FRD or TFNI be returned to the RD category?

#### § § 1045.85

      (a) To be eligible to become FRD or TFNI, information must first be classified as RD in accordance with the AEA and this part. FRD and TFNI are removed from and may be returned to the RD category under section 142 of the AEA. The process by which information is removed from the RD category and placed into the FRD or TFNI category or returned to the RD category is called transclassification and involves the following decisions:

      (1) For information to be transclassified from RD to the FRD category, the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security and the appropriate official within DoD (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions) must jointly determine that the information relates primarily to the military utilization of nuclear weapons and can be adequately protected in a manner similar to NSI.

      (2) For information to be transclassified from RD to the TFNI category, the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security and the DNI must jointly determine that information concerning a foreign nuclear energy program that falls under the RD definition must be removed from the RD category in order to carry out the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, and can be adequately protected in a manner similar to NSI.

      (b) The process to return FRD and TFNI to the RD category is as follows:

      (1) FRD may be returned to the RD category if the DOE and DoD jointly determine that the programmatic requirements that caused the information to be removed from the RD category no longer apply, the information would be more appropriately protected as RD and returning the information to the RD category is in the interest of national security. DOE jointly with DoD must notify all appropriate agencies of the change.

      (2) TFNI may be returned to the RD category if the DOE and the DNI jointly determine that the programmatic requirements that caused the information to be removed from the RD category no longer apply, the information would be more appropriately protected as RD and returning the information to the RD category is in the interest of national security. DOE jointly with the DNI must notify all appropriate agencies of the change.

      Yes. Under the AEA, DOE may classify information that is privately generated ( not under a Government contract) as RD. This may only be done in writing by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. This responsibility cannot be delegated. Once such a determination is made, DOE must notify the public through the  This notice is not required to reveal any details about the determination and must protect the national security as well as the interests of the private party.

      § 1045.95   What are the criteria used to assign levels to RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.95

      (a) When the Director, Office of Classification, makes the initial determination that information is RD, he or she determines the appropriate level of the information based on the damage that would occur if there was an unauthorized disclosure of the information. The Director, Office of Classification, also determines the level for TFNI, and, jointly with the appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or successor instructions) determines the level for FRD information.

      (b) The three classification levels of RD, FRD, and TFNI are:

      (1)  Top Secret is applied to information that is vital to the national security the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the appropriate official is able to identify or describe.

      (2)  Secret is applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the appropriate official is able to identify or describe.

      (3)  Confidential is applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause undue risk to the common defense and security that the appropriate official is able to identify or describe.

      § 1045.100   How are RD, FRD, and TFNI declassified?

#### § § 1045.100

      (a) This section addresses the declassification of information, not derivatively classified matter. See Subpart D for requirements for the declassification of matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      (b) RD and TFNI are declassified by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security by evaluating the criteria in § 1045.70. FRD requires the evaluation of the same criteria and a joint decision by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security and the appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions).

      § 1045.105   What is the method to request the declassification of RD, FRD or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.105

      (a) If a person believes RD, FRD, or TFNI should not be classified, he or she may submit a declassification proposal. Proposals must be submitted in writing and must include a description of the information concerned and may include a reason for the request. If submitted by a person with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI, the request must be submitted through secure means. The proposal is processed as follows:

      (b) The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security considers declassification proposals from the public and Government agencies and their contractors for the declassification of RD, FRD, and TFNI on an ongoing basis. For FRD, the Director, Office of Classification, will coordinate the declassification proposal with the appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions).

      (c) Declassification proposals may be sent to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, EHSS-1/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585. For FRD, the proposal may be sent to the Director, Office of Classification, or the appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions). DOE and DoD must coordinate with one another concerning declassification proposals for FRD.

      § 1045.110   How are challenges to the classification and declassification of RD, FRD, or TFNI submitted and processed?

#### § § 1045.110

      (a) Any person with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI who believes that RD, FRD, or TFNI is improperly classified is encouraged and expected to challenge the classification. The challenge may be to information RD, FRD, or TFNI ( a guide topic) or the classification status of matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      (b) Challenges are submitted in accordance with agency procedures.

      (c) Each agency must establish procedures for a person to challenge the classification status of RD, FRD, or TFNI if they believe that the classification status is improper. These procedures must:

      (1) Advise the person of their right to submit a challenge directly to the Director, Office of Classification, EHSS-60/Germantown Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585, at any time.

      (2) Ensure that under no circumstances is an employee subject to retribution for challenging the classification status of RD, FRD, or TFNI;

      (3) Require the agency that initially receives the challenge to provide an initial response within 60 days to the person submitting the challenge.

      (4) Require the agency to advise the person of their appeal rights. If the employee is not satisfied with the agency response or the agency has not responded to the challenge within 180 days, the challenge involving RD, FRD, or TFNI may be appealed to the Director, Office of Classification.

      (i) In the case of FRD and RD related primarily to the military utilization of nuclear weapons, the Director, Office of Classification, coordinates with the appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions).

      (ii) In the case of TFNI, the Director, Office of Classification, coordinates with DNI.

      (5) If the response to the initial appeal and its justification for classification does not satisfy the person making the challenge, a further appeal may be made to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, EHSS-1/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585.

      (d) Agency responses to RD or TFNI challenges are limited to interpreting the application of guidance to derivatively classify matter. Except for DoD, agency responses to FRD are limited to interpreting the application of guidance to derivatively classify matter. An agency may coordinate challenges regarding interpreting guidance for RD or TFNI with DOE, and may coordinate challenges regarding interpreting guidance for FRD with DOE or DoD.

      (e) Agencies must forward challenges that require decisions other than interpreting the application of guidance ( challenges to guide topics) to the Director, Office of Classification.

    Subpart D—Classifying and Declassifying Matter Containing RD, FRD, or TFNI

      § 1045.115   Who is authorized to derivatively classify matter that contains RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.115

      (a) Specific authority and/or training is required to derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI. These derivative classification decisions must be based on a classification guide, a classification bulletin, or a portion-marked source document and must only be made in the RD Derivative Classifier's subject areas of expertise. In cases where guidance does not exist, for RD the Director, Office of Classification must make an initial determination that information is RD or that the matter contains RD, and for FRD DOE and DoD must jointly determine that the information is FRD or the matter contains FRD. No other agency or agency personnel has the authority to make an initial determination regarding RD or FRD. See § 1045.135 for the process for requesting a determination in cases where guidance does not exist.

      (b) Each person who derivatively classifies matter containing RD or FRD must be an RD Derivative Classifier.

      (c) Except for DoD military and DoD Federal civilian employees, each RD Derivative Classifier must be designated by name or position in writing in accordance with agency procedures.

      (d) An agency contractor employee may be an RD Derivative Classifier. All contractor employees, including DoD contractors, must be designated by name or position as such in writing in accordance with agency procedures.

      (e) Once a person is an RD Derivative Classifier for an agency, he or she may classify matter containing RD or FRD in those subject areas in which they have programmatic expertise for any agency, provided the other agency or agencies accept the existing authority.

      (f) No specific designation as an RD Derivative Classifier is required to classify matter containing TFNI. Any person who has received training required by § 1045.120 may classify matter containing TFNI.

      § 1045.120   What training is required for persons who have access to or who derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.120

      (a) Prior to being authorized access to RD and FRD, a person must receive training that explains:

      (1) What information is potentially RD and FRD;

      (2) Matter that potentially contains RD or FRD must be reviewed by an RD Derivative Classifier to determine whether it contains RD or FRD;

      (3) DOE must review matter that potentially contains RD or TFNI for public release and DOE or DoD must review matter that potentially contains FRD for public release;

      (4) RD Derivative Classification authority is required to classify or upgrade matter containing RD or FRD, or to downgrade the level of matter containing RD or FRD;

      (5) Only a person trained in accordance with this section, may classify matter containing TFNI;

      (6) Matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing RD; only DOE or DoD authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing FRD;

      (7) How to submit a challenge if they believe RD, FRD, or TFNI information ( a guide topic) or matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is not properly classified; and

      (8) Access requirements for matter marked as containing RD or FRD.

      (b) Each person with access to RD and FRD must also receive periodic refresher briefings covering these same topics.

      (c) In addition to the training in paragraph (a) of this section, prior to derivatively classifying matter containing RD, or FRD and every 2 years thereafter, each RD Derivative Classifier must also receive training that explains:

      (1) The use of classification guides, classification bulletins, and portion-marked source documents to classify matter containing RD and FRD;

      (2) What to do if applicable classification guidance is not available;

      (3) Limitations on an RD Derivative Classifier's authority to remove RD or FRD portions from matter; and

      (4) Marking requirements for matter containing RD and FRD.

      (d) Prior to having access to TFNI, and periodically thereafter, each person must receive the following training (which may be combined with the training required for access to RD or FRD):

      (1) What information is potentially TFNI;

      (2) Only a person with appropriate training may determine if matter contains TFNI;

      (3) Marking requirements for matter containing TFNI;

      (4) Matter containing TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing TFNI; and

      (5) How to submit a challenge if they believe TFNI information ( a guide topic) or matter containing TFNI is not properly classified.

      (e) In addition to the training in § 1045.120(d), prior to derivatively classifying matter containing TFNI and every 2 years thereafter, each person who derivatively classifies matter containing TFNI must also receive training that explains:

      (1) The markings applied to matter containing TFNI;

      (2) Limitations on their authority to remove TFNI portions from matter;

      (3) Only DOE authorized persons may determine that classified matter no longer contains TFNI;

      (4) Only DOE authorized persons may declassify matter marked as containing TFNI; and

      (5) DOE must review matter that potentially contains TFNI for public release.

      § 1045.125   What is the process for reviewing and derivatively classifying matter that potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.125

      (a)  Prior to the review of matter to determine if it contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, the matter must be protected at the overall potential highest level and category and marked as a working paper in accordance with § 1045.140.

      (b)  Any person who generates or possesses matter that potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI that is intended for public release must ensure that it is reviewed by the Director, Office of Classification, or a DOE official granted the authority by delegation, regulation, or DOE directive, prior to release. FRD may also be reviewed by the appropriate DoD official as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions.

      (c)  Matter that potentially contains RD or FRD that is not intended for public release must be reviewed by an RD Derivative Classifier.

      (d)  Matter that potentially contains TFNI that is not intended for public release must be reviewed by a person who has been trained in accordance with § 1045.120(e).

      (e)  Because the open literature may contain information that is still classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI, matter that incorporates information from the open literature that is potentially RD, FRD, or TFNI must be reviewed as required under this section.

      (f)  If, when reviewing matter under the automatic or systematic review provisions of E.O. 13526 or successor orders, the person finds matter potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI that it is not correctly marked:

      (1) An RD Classifier may review the matter to determine if it contains RD or FRD. If the matter is determined to contain RD or FRD, the matter must be appropriately marked and is exempt from automatic declassification.

      (2) A person trained to classify TFNI may review the matter to determine if it contains TFNI. If the matter is determined to contain TFNI, the matter must be appropriately marked and is exempt from automatic declassification.

      (3) If an authorized person is unable to make a determination for RD, FRD, or TFNI, the matter must be referred to DOE. Matter containing FRD may also be referred to DoD. The matter may not be automatically declassified until DOE or DoD makes a determination as to its classification status.

      § 1045.130   How does an authorized person derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.130

      (a)  For RD or FRD, an RD Derivative Classifier makes the derivative classification determination using:

      (1) A DOE classification guide or bulletin, a joint DOE-agency classification guide, an agency guide with RD/FRD topics that is within his or her programmatic area of expertise; or

      (2) An applicable portion-marked source document.

      (b)  For TFNI, a person who is trained to derivatively classify matter containing TFNI makes the determination using:

      (1) Approved TFNI guidelines;

      (2) A DOE classification guide or bulletin, a joint DOE-agency classification guide, an agency guide with RD, FRD, or TFNI topics within his or her programmatic area of expertise; or

      (3) An applicable portion-marked source document.

      (c)  (1)  If two or more different, unclassified facts when combined in a specific way result in a classified statement, or if two or more different classified facts or unclassified and classified facts when combined in a specific way result in a higher classification level or more restrictive category, then an RD Derivative Classifier may classify or upgrade the matter based on the association. If the matter is to be portion marked, then each portion of the associated information must be marked at the level and category of the association.

      (2)  A large number of often similar unclassified pieces of information or a large number of often similar RD, FRD, or TFNI pieces of information by selection, arrangement, or completeness in matter may add sufficient value to merit classification or to merit classification at a higher level. If there is a classification guide topic that applies to the compilation, an RD Derivative Classifier may classify the information by compilation. In the absence of a classification guide topic that applies, for RD or TFNI, the Director, Office of Classification, may make the determination to classify or upgrade the matter based on compilation. For FRD, the Director, Office of Classification, or any appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions) may classify or upgrade the matter based on compilation. Matter that is classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI based on compilation is never portion marked.

      (d)  When it is important to maximize the amount of information available to the public or to simplify matter handling procedures, the RD, FRD, or TFNI should be segregated into a classified addendum.

      § 1045.135   Can a person make an RD, FRD, or TFNI classification determination if applicable classification guidance is not available?

#### § § 1045.135

      (a) No. If an RD Derivative Classifier or a person trained to classify matter containing TFNI is unable to locate a classification guide or classification bulletin that applies to the nuclear-related information within his or her programmatic expertise and does not have an applicable portion-marked source document to use for derivative classification, then he or she must contact the RDMO or an ARDMO for assistance. The RDMO/ARDMO may be aware of other classification guidance that could apply to the information.

      (b) If no guidance is identified, the RDMO must forward the matter to the Director, Office of Classification, for a determination. Within 30 days, the Director, Office of Classification must:

      (1) Determine whether the information is already classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI under current classification guidance and, if so, provide such guidance to the RDMO who forwarded the matter.

      (2) If the information is not already classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI, the procedures for initially classifying information as RD, FRD, or TFNI under § 1045.70 must be followed. The Director, Office of Classification, must notify the RDMO of the results of the initial classification determination within 90 days of receiving the matter. Initial determinations must be incorporated into classified guides, as appropriate.

      (c) Pending a determination, the matter under review must be protected at a minimum as Secret RD, Secret FRD, or Secret TFNI, as appropriate.

      § 1045.140   How is matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI marked?

#### § § 1045.140

      (a)  Matter determined to contain RD, FRD, or TFNI must be clearly marked to convey to the holder of that matter that it contains such information.

      (b)  Matter generated by/for the IC containing RD, FRD, or TFNI must be marked in accordance with the requirements in this part as described in ICD 710 or successor directives, and the corresponding implementation directives and policy guidance issued or approved by the DNI concerning marking matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI.

      (c)  Prior to the determination that matter contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, it must be marked and protected as a working paper. Matter that has not been reviewed that potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, or is expected to be revised prior to the preparation of a finished product that contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, must be dated when created or last changed, marked with the highest potential level and category of information (and caveats, when applicable) on the bottom and top of each page, and must be protected at the highest potential level and category of the information contained in the matter. The matter must also be marked “Draft” or “Working Paper” on the front cover. The RD/FRD admonishment is not required. RD Derivative Classifier authority is not required to mark working papers containing RD or FRD. However, working papers containing RD or FRD must be reviewed by an RD Derivative Classifier, and working papers containing TFNI must be reviewed by a person trained to mark matter containing TFNI, and the matter must be marked as a final document when it is:

      (1) Released outside the originating activity;

      (2) Retained more than 180 days from the date of origin or the date of the last change; or

      (3) Filed permanently.

      (d)  An RD Derivative Classifier applies or authorizes the application of the following markings on matter determined to contain RD or FRD:

      (1)  The front page of matter containing RD or FRD must have the page/banner markings at the top and bottom, the RD or FRD admonishment, subject/title marking, and the classification authority block.

      (i)  The top and bottom of the front page must clearly indicate the overall classification level of the matter. The classification category may also be included. No other markings are required in the page/banner marking.

      (ii)  (A) If the matter contains RD or RD and FRD, use the following admonishment:

      This document contains RESTRICTED DATA as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.

      (B) If the document contains FRD and no RD, use the following admonishment:

      Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as RESTRICTED DATA in foreign dissemination. Section 144b, Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

      (iii)  The classification level and category of the text of the subject or title ( U, SRD, CFRD, S//RD, C//FRD) must be marked immediately preceding the text of the subject or title.

      (iv)  The classification authority block for matter containing RD or FRD must identify the RD Derivative Classifier who classified the matter and the classification guidance used to classify the matter.

      (A)  The RD Derivative Classifier must be identified by name and position or title, and, if not otherwise evident, the agency and office of origin must be identified. An RD Derivative Classifier may also be identified by a unique identifier. For example:

      Classified By:

      (B)  () If a classification guide is used to classify the matter, the “Derived From” line must include the short title of the guide, the issue date of the guide, the issuing agency and, when available, office of origin. For example:

      Derived From:

      () If a source document is used to classify the matter, it must be identified, including the office of origin and the date of the source document. If more than one classification guide or source document is used, the words “Multiple Sources” may be included. In the case of multiple sources, a source list identifying each guide or source document must be included with all copies of the matter.

      (C)  Matter containing RD or FRD are never automatically declassified and must either omit the “Declassify On” line, or indicate that the matter is exempt from automatic declassification (Not Applicable or N/A for RD/FRD, as appropriate).

      (2)  Each interior page of matter containing RD or FRD must be clearly marked at the top and bottom with the overall classification level and category of the matter or the overall classification level and category of the page, whichever is preferred. The abbreviations “RD” and “FRD” may be used in conjunction with the matter classification ( SECRET//RD, CONFIDENTIAL//FRD).

      (3)  The outside of the back cover or back page must be marked with the overall level of information in the matter.

      (4)  Other than the required subject/title marking, portion marking is permitted, but not required, for matter containing RD or FRD. Each agency that generates matter containing RD or FRD determines the policy for portion marking matter generated within the agency. If matter containing RD or FRD is portion marked, each portion containing RD or FRD must be marked with the level and category of the information in the portion ( SRD, CFRD, S//RD, C//FRD).

      (e)  If matter contains RD or FRD commingled with TFNI, the RD or FRD markings take precedence. If matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, a person who is trained to classify matter containing TFNI applies or authorizes the application markings on matter determined to contain TFNI in accordance with 32 CFR part 2001.22, or successor regulations, and with this part.

      (1)  If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, no admonishment is required on the front page, but the top and bottom of the front page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level and the TFNI label ( SECRET//TFNI).

      (2)  The classification level and category of the subject or title must be marked immediately preceding the text of the subject or title.

      (3)  Matter containing TFNI and no RD or FRD must be portion marked. Each portion containing TFNI must be marked immediately preceding the portion to which it applies with the level and category of the information in the portion ( S//TFNI).

      (4)  The classifier and guidance used to classify matter containing TFNI must be identified as described in § 1045.40(d)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). In addition, the “Declassify On” line must be annotated with the statement: “Not Applicable [or N/A] to TFNI portions.”

      (5)  If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, the top and bottom of each interior page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level and the TFNI label ( SECRET//TFNI) or the overall classification level for each page with the TFNI label included on only those pages that contain TFNI, whichever is preferred.

      (6)  If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, the top and bottom of the outside of the back cover or back page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level of information in the matter.

      (f)  Matter that contains a mixture of RD, FRD, or TFNI and NSI, and is portion marked, must also comply with the following:

      (1)  If the matter is not portion marked, then no declassification instructions are included. If the matter is portion marked, declassification instructions for each portion must be included in a source list. See this paragraph (f)(2) and E.O. 13526 or successor orders for instructions on annotating the source list.

      (2)  The source list must include declassification instructions for all NSI sources used to classify the NSI portions. The declassification instructions for sources that are used to classify the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions must state “Not applicable [or N/A] to RD/FRD/TFNI (as appropriate).” The source list must not appear on the front page of the matter, unless the matter is a single page. If the matter is a single page, the source list may appear at the bottom of the page, and must be clearly separate from the classification authority block.

      (g)  (1) If matter containing RD and/or FRD and CUI is not portion marked, CUI markings are not required.

      (2)  (i) If the matter contains RD or FRD and is not portion marked, then CUI decontrol instructions must not be included.

      (ii) If the matter is portion marked and decontrol instructions are applied, the decontrol instructions for the CUI portions must not be on the front page. Where they appear, they must be clearly labeled as decontrol instructions for CUI.

      (iii) If the matter contains TFNI, and decontrol instructions are applied, the decontrol instructions for the CUI portions must not be on the front page. Where they appear they must be clearly labeled as decontrol instructions for CUI.

      (h)  Standard RD, FRD, or TFNI markings must be applied to matter in special formats ( photographs, flash memory drives, compact discs, audio or video tapes) to the extent practicable. Regardless of the precise markings in such cases, any special format matter that contains RD, FRD, or TFNI must be marked so that both a person in physical possession of the matter and a person with access to the information in or on the matter are aware that it contains RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      § 1045.145   Who must review output from a classified IT system that is marked as RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.145

      If the output is a final product that has been reviewed by a person with appropriate authority, and is properly marked, or is a working paper that is properly marked, no additional review is required. Otherwise, the output must be reviewed in accordance with § 1045.30.

      § 1045.150   Can anyone remove the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions and markings to produce an NSI or unclassified version of the matter?

#### § § 1045.150

      (a)  Specific authority is required to remove RD, FRD, or TFNI portions from matter. The authority required depends on whether the matter is intended for public release, the category of information in the matter, and whether the matter is portion marked.

      (b)  An RD Derivative Classifier or a person trained to classify matter containing TFNI does not have the authority to remove the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions or markings for matter intended for public release. The matter must be submitted in accordance with § 1045.125 to the appropriate agency who will review the matter and remove the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions and markings.

      (c)  (1) An RD Derivative Classifier may remove the portions marked as containing RD or FRD and remove the RD or FRD markings.

      (2) A person trained in accordance with § 1045.120(e) may remove the portions containing TFNI and the TFNI markings.

      (3) In all cases under § 1045.150(b) this may be done only if the matter is originated by the authorized person's agency and the matter is portion marked, and the resulting matter is reviewed to ensure it does not contain RD, FRD, or TFNI by a person authorized to review the matter.

      § 1045.155   How is matter marked as containing RD, FRD, or TFNI declassified?

#### § § 1045.155

      (a)  RD, FRD, and TFNI are never automatically declassified. No date or event for automatic declassification ever applies to RD, FRD, or TFNI, even when commingled with NSI. It takes positive action by an authorized person to declassify matter potentially containing or marked as containing RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      (b)  Only authorized persons within DOE may declassify matter marked as RD or TFNI and only authorized persons within DOE or DoD may declassify matter marked as FRD. Only these same persons may identify the portions of classified matter that contain RD, FRD, or TFNI that must be redacted prior to public release.

      (c)  Except as allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, only designated persons in DOE may declassify matter marked as containing RD or TFNI or identify the RD or TFNI portions of matter that must be removed from the matter prior to public release. Such determinations must be based on classification guides.

      (d)  Except as allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, only designated persons in DOE or appropriate persons in DoD (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions) may declassify matter marked as containing FRD or determine the FRD portions of matter that must be removed prior to public release. Such determinations must be based on classification guides.

      (e)  The Director, Office of Classification, may delegate declassification authority for matter containing RD and TFNI to other agencies Federal and contractor personnel. The Director, Office of Classification, or an appropriate person in DoD (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions) may delegate declassification authority for matter containing FRD to qualified Federal or contractor personnel in other agencies.

      § 1045.160   When the RD, FRD, or TFNI is removed from matter, what action must be taken if the matter still contains NSI?

#### § § 1045.160

      When an appropriate authority removes the RD, FRD, or TFNI from matter and it still contains NSI, the matter must be marked following E.O. 13526 and 32 CFR part 2001 or successor orders and regulations, including portion marking if the matter was not previously portion marked, and the classification authority block of the matter must be changed to contain declassification instructions for the NSI. This does not apply to matter produced as part of the coordination process for declassification or public release reviews.

      § 1045.165   Once matter marked as RD, FRD, or TFNI is declassified, how is it marked?

#### § § 1045.165

      (a) Matter that is determined to no longer contain RD, FRD, or TFNI and also does not or no longer contains NSI must be clearly marked to convey to the holder of that matter that the matter is declassified;

      (b) The front page must identify the person authorizing the declassification by name and position or title, if not otherwise evident, agency, and office of origin; or with a unique identifier; the classification guide that served as the basis for the declassification by short title, date, agency and, when available, the office of origin; and the declassification date. For example:

      (1) Declassified by:

      (2) Derived from:

      (3) Declassified on:

      (c) The person authorizing the declassification must line through but not obliterate the classification markings and apply or authorize the application of the appropriate markings.

    Subpart E—Government-Wide Procedures for Handling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) Requests for Matter Marked as or Potentially Containing RD, FRD, or TFNI

      § 1045.170   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1045.170

      This subpart contains requirements that apply when Federal agencies other than DOE receive FOIA or MDR requests for matter that is marked as or potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI. RD, FRD, and TFNI are classified under the Atomic Energy Act and are not subject to the provisions governing MDR requests under E.O. 13526 or successor orders. To ensure RD, FRD, and TFNI are considered and appropriately reviewed when requested under a FOIA or MDR request, this section describes the process Federal agencies must follow for FOIA and MDR requests for matter that is marked as or potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      § 1045.175   How must agencies process FOIA and MDR requests for matter that is marked as or potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.175

      (a) When an agency receives a FOIA or MDR request for which any responsive matter is marked as or potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, the agency must forward the matter to the appropriate agency as follows:

      (1) Forward any matter marked as or potentially containing RD or TFNI to the Director, Office of Classification or a DOE official granted authority by delegation, regulation, or DOE directive.

      (2) Forward any matter originated by DOE and marked as or potentially containing FRD to either the Director, Office of Classification or a DOE official granted authority by delegation, regulation, or DOE directive. Forward any matter originated by DoD and marked as or potentially containing FRD to the appropriate DoD program (as specified in DoD Manual 5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program, subsequent manuals, or other applicable manuals). Matter not originated by DOE or DoD may be submitted to either agency as provided in this paragraph.

      (b) DOE and DoD must coordinate the review of matter marked as or potentially containing RD and FRD, when appropriate. DOE and the DNI must coordinate the review of matter marked as or potentially containing TFNI, when appropriate.

      (c) DOE, DoD, or the DNI may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested matter whenever the fact of its existence or nonexistence is itself classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      (d) If the information contained in the requested matter has been reviewed for declassification within the past 2 years, another review need not be conducted, but instead the agency may inform the requester of this fact and of the results of the prior review decision.

      (e) When paragraph (c) or (d) of this section do not apply, and the information requested under an MDR is not exempt under § 1045.195, the appropriate DOE or DoD authority must conduct a line-by-line review of matter forwarded under paragraph (a) of this section; identify the information that is classified under current classification guidance as RD, FRD, or TFNI; and respond to the agency that forwarded the matter. The response to the agency who forwarded the request must identify the RD, FRD, or TFNI that is exempt from public release; provide the FOIA exemption or appropriate MDR notation for the RD, FRD, or TFNI withheld; identify the Denying Official for the RD, FRD, or TFNI withheld; and explain the applicable appeal procedures for a FOIA request identified in 10 CFR 1004.8 or for an MDR request identified in § 1045.180.

      (1) The Denying Officials are as follows:

      (i) The Denying Official for matter containing RD or TFNI is the Director, Office of Classification.

      (ii) The Denying Official for matter containing FRD is the Director, Office of Classification, or the appropriate DoD Component's Initial Denying Authority (as specified in applicable DoD manuals).

      (iii) The Denying Official for Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Deputy Director, Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors.

      (f) Upon receipt of the response from DOE or DOD, the agency processing the initial request must inform the requester of the results of the review; provide the name of the Denying Official identified for any RD, FRD, or TFNI withheld; and advise the requester of his or her appeal rights concerning the RD, FRD, or TFNI.

      § 1045.180   What is the procedure if an agency receives an appeal to a FOIA or MDR concerning the denial of RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.180

      (a) If an agency receives a FOIA appeal for RD, FRD, or TFNI denied by DOE within 90 days of receipt of the denial and as required under 10 CFR 1004.8, the appeal must be submitted to the DOE Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. If an agency receives a FOIA appeal for FRD denied by DoD, it must be submitted to DoD in accordance with applicable DoD FOIA regulations or instructions.

      (b) Appeals of an MDR response when DOE denied RD, FRD, or TFNI may be submitted to the agency that replied to the initial MDR request or directly to DOE.

      (1) When an MDR appeal concerning DOE-withheld RD, FRD, or TFNI is sent to the agency that replied to the initial MDR request, the appeal must be received by the agency who replied to the initial request within 60 days of receipt of the denial and contain the information required under § 1045.210(b). The agency must forward the appeal to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security at the following address Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, EHSS-1/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585.

      (2) When sent directly to DOE, an MDR appeal must be received by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security within 60 days of the denial and contain the information required under § 1045.210(b).

      (3) MDR appeals received by DOE are processed consistent with § 1045.220.

      (c) If an agency receives an MDR appeal for FRD withheld by DoD, the agency must submit the appeal to the appropriate DoD Component as identified in applicable DoD manuals.

      (d) MDR Final Appeal: The classification and declassification of RD, FRD, and TFNI is governed by the AEA and this part and is not subject to E.O. 13526 or successor orders. Therefore, MDR appeal decisions by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, for RD, FRD, and TFNI and MDR appeal decisions by the appropriate DoD Component appellate authority for FRD are final agency decisions and are not subject to review by ISCAP. However, if matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI also contains NSI, the NSI portions may be appealed to the ISCAP. Prior to submission to ISCAP, the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions must be deleted.

      (e) The FOIA and MDR appeal authorities for RD, FRD, or TFNI are as follows:

      (1) The appeal authority for RD and TFNI is the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security.

      (2) The appeal authority for FRD is the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security or the appropriate DoD Component appellate authority.

      (3) The appeal authority for Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information is the NNSA Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors.

      (f) Declassification proposals resulting from appeal reviews: The appeal review of RD, FRD, and TFNI withheld from a requester is based on current classification guidance. However, as part of the appeal review, the withheld information must be reviewed to determine if it may be a candidate for possible declassification. If declassification of the information appears to be appropriate, then a declassification proposal must be initiated, and the requester must be advised that additional information will be available if the declassification proposal is approved.

    Subpart F—DOE-Specific Procedures for MDR Requests

      § 1045.185   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1045.185

      This subpart describes the process for MDR requests submitted for DOE matter classified under E.O. 13526 or successor orders, and the Atomic Energy Act.

      § 1045.190   How does the public submit an MDR for DOE classified matter?

#### § § 1045.190

      (a) DOE matter marked as containing NSI, RD, FRD, or TFNI is subject to review for declassification by DOE if the request for a declassification review describes the matter containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable DOE to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort.

      (b) The request must be sent to the Director, Office of Classification, EHSS-60/Germantown Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585.

> [83 FR 66007, Dec. 21, 2018, as amended at 88 FR 41295, June 26, 2023]

      § 1045.195   Is any matter exempt from MDR requests?

#### § § 1045.195

      (a) MDR requests are not accepted for:

      (1) Matter containing RD technical engineering, blueprints, and design regarding nuclear weapons, if they contain no NSI.

      (2) Matter required to be submitted for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement;

      (3) Matter that is the subject of pending litigation; or

      (4) Any matter contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under the FOIA in accordance with law.

      (b) Current Presidential records as described in section 3.5(b) of E.O. 13526 or successor orders that are in the custody of DOE are exempt from release in response to an MDR request.

      § 1045.200   Is there a cost for an MDR review?

#### § § 1045.200

      Yes. The fees, including waivers, reductions, and categorizations, are the same for an MDR as for providing records under the FOIA as defined in 10 CFR 1004.9.

      § 1045.205   How does DOE conduct an MDR review?

#### § § 1045.205

      (a) If DOE has reviewed the information contained in the requested matter for declassification within the past 2 years, DOE need not conduct another review. DOE may instead inform the requester of this fact and of the prior review decision, as well as advise the requester of his or her appeal rights as provided in § 1045.210.

      (b) DOE performs an MDR as follows:

      (1) Conducts a line-by-line review of the matter;

      (2) Coordinates the review with appropriate programs and agencies, as necessary;

      (3) Identifies and withholds any information that meets the standards for classification;

      (4) Declassifies any NSI that no longer meets the standards for classification under E.O. 13526 or successor orders and any RD, FRD, or TFNI that no longer meets the standards for classification under this part;

      (5) If the matter also contains unclassified information that is potentially exempt from release under the FOIA, the matter is further processed to ensure unclassified information that is exempt from public release is identified and that the appropriate officials responsible for denying any unclassified portion of the matter are provided and listed with the notice of denial.

      (6) Upon completion of the review, releases the matter to the requester unless withholding is authorized by law. If NSI, RD, FRD, or TFNI, is withheld, the response must advise the requester of his or her appeal rights under § 1045.210.

      § 1045.210   How does a person submit an appeal if DOE withholds classified information in an MDR response?

#### § § 1045.210

      (a) When the Director, Office of Classification, denies NSI, RD, FRD, or TFNI, or the NNSA Deputy Director, Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors, denies Naval Nuclear Propulsion information, in matter requested under an MDR, the requester may appeal the determination to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security. The appeal must be received within 60 days of the receipt of the denial.

      (b) The appeal must be in writing and submitted to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, EHSS-1/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585. The appeal:

      (1) Must contain a concise statement of grounds upon which it is brought, and a description of the relief sought.

      (2) Must include a copy of the letter containing the determination being appealed.

      (3) Should include a discussion of all relevant authorities that include but are not limited to DOE (and predecessor agencies) rulings, regulations, interpretations, and decisions on appeals, as well as any judicial determinations being relied upon to support the appeal.

      § 1045.215   How does DOE process an MDR appeal for DOE matter containing NSI?

#### § § 1045.215

      An appeal for NSI requested under the provisions of E.O. 13526 or successor orders is processed as follows:

      (a) The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security must act upon the appeal within 60 working days of its receipt. If no determination on the appeal has been issued at the end of this 60-day period, the requester may consider his or her administrative remedies to be exhausted and may seek a review by the ISCAP. When no determination can be issued within the applicable time limit, the appeal must nevertheless continue to be processed. On expiration of the time limit, DOE must inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be issued, and of the requester's right to seek further review by the ISCAP. Nothing in this subpart precludes the appeal authority and the requester from agreeing to an extension of time for the decision on an appeal. The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security must confirm any such agreement in writing and clearly specify the total time agreed upon for the appeal decision.

      (b) The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security's action on an appeal must be in writing and set forth the reason for the decision. DOE may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or nonexistence is itself classified under E.O. 13526 or successor orders.

      (c) The requester has the right to appeal a final DOE decision, or a failure to provide a determination on an appeal within the allotted time, to the ISCAP for those appeals dealing with NSI. In cases where NSI documents also contain RD, FRD, or TFNI, the portions of the document containing RD, FRD, or TFNI must be deleted prior to forwarding the NSI and unclassified portions to the ISCAP for review.

      § 1045.220   How does DOE process an MDR appeal for matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?

#### § § 1045.220

      (a) Final appeals for DOE matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI are submitted to the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security. The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security will coordinate appeals concerning Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information with the NNSA Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors.

      (b) The classification and declassification of RD, FRD, and TFNI is governed by the AEA and this part and is not subject to E.O. 13526 or successor orders. Therefore, appeal decisions concerning RD, FRD, or TFNI by the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security, or the NNSA Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors are not subject to review by ISCAP.

  PART 1046—MEDICAL, PHYSICAL READINESS, TRAINING, AND ACCESS AUTHORIZATION STANDARDS FOR PROTECTIVE FORCE PERSONNEL

### Part 1046

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2011,  42 U.S.C. 7101,  50 U.S.C. 2401,

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 55184, Sept. 10, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1046.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1046.1

      This part establishes the medical, physical readiness, training and performance standards for contractor protective force (PF) personnel who provide security services at Department of Energy (DOE or Department) facilities including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). DOE and NNSA may choose to incorporate elements of these standards into Federal protective force programs.

      § 1046.2   Scope.

#### § § 1046.2

      (a) This part applies to DOE, including NNSA, contractor employees and applicants for contractor protective force positions at government-owned or government leased facilities, regardless of whether the facility is privately operated. This part provides for the establishment of physical security programs based on uniform standards for medical, physical performance, training, and access authorizations for PF personnel providing physical security services to the Department.

      (b) Use of a single, suitably qualified individual is encouraged when it is operationally, fiscally, or otherwise appropriate to perform multiple roles as required in this part (e.g., Designated Physician and Physical Protection Medical Director (PPMD)). Similarly, when appropriate medical, psychological, or other examinations, evaluations, testing, or reports required by other DOE regulations can be used to satisfy the requirements of multiple parts of this title, nothing in this part is intended to require duplicative examinations, evaluations, testing, or reports as long as the requirements of this part are met.

      (c) The Department is authorized to grant such exemptions from the requirements of this part as it determines are authorized by law. Exemptions may not be granted from the requirement to meet any essential function of a position notwithstanding that reasonable accommodation must be granted as required by this part and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act of 2009 (ADAAA), and its implementing regulations. Exemptions from requirements other than the medical certification standards are allowed only on a case-by-case basis for a specific requirement covered under this part. The Department must document that the exemption will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Consistent with the exemption process specified by DOE, exemptions must be made from this part in consultation with the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS-1) and approved by the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, or for the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Administrator. Granting of equivalencies is not authorized. Nothing in this part shall prohibit NNSA from enhancing the requirements set forth in § 1046.16, SPO Physical Readiness Qualification Standards and Procedures, as necessary to further the interests of national security.

      (d) Requests for technical clarification of the requirements of this part by organizations or individuals affected by its requirements must be made in writing through the appropriate program or staff offices of the Department. Such requests must be coordinated with EHSS or its successor organization. EHSS-1 is responsible for providing a written response to such requests. Requests for interpretations of the requirements of this part may be made to the General Counsel. The General Counsel is responsible for providing responses to such requests.

      (e) This part is effective March 10, 2014. Requirements of this rule that cannot be implemented by March 10, 2014 due to contractual conflicts or within existing resources must be documented by the officially designated federal security authority (ODFSA) and submitted to the relevant program officers: the Under Secretary; the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation or the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, NNSA; and the Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security. The documentation must include timelines and resources needed to fully implement this part.

These interests may include (but are not limited to) Department and contractor personnel; sensitive technology; classified matter; nuclear weapons, components, and assemblies; special nuclear material (SNM) as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended) and the Department; other nuclear materials; secure communications centers; sensitive compartmented information facilities; automated data processing centers or facilities storing and transmitting classified information; vital equipment; or other Department property.

      (SO) means an unarmed uniformed PF member who has no Departmental arrest or detention authority, used to support SPOs and/or to perform duties (e.g., administrative, access control, facility patrol, escort, assessment and reporting of alarms) where an armed presence is not required.

      (SPO) means a uniformed PF member who is authorized under section 161(k) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, section 661 of the DOE Organization Act, or other statutory authority, to carry firearms and to make arrests without warrant for specifically enumerated offenses and who is employed for, and charged with, the protection of Department security interests.

      means, for the purpose of this part, an interview by a Psychologist who meets standards established by DOE and who has the latitude to vary the focus and content of the questions depending upon the interviewee's responses.

      commonly referred to as SRT, means a PF special operations unit comprised of SPOs whose primary mission is to resolve incidents that require activities and force options that exceed the capability of existing physical security systems (e.g., performance of recapture/recovery operations and augmentation of denial missions).

      (SRT)  means SPOs who meet the ARS, with additional training and qualification requirements as necessary, and who are assigned to an SRT that trains and responds as a team to perform recapture and recovery and to augment denial missions, e.g., those missions that require adversaries be denied proximity to the protected property.

      means a process based on a predetermined, objective set of criteria approved by the respective program office in consultation with EHSS-1 that results in a grade (e.g., pass/fail). The process must ensure that an individual (or team, for crew-served weapons) demonstrates the ability to perform all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing/returning to safe mode the weapons system at the conclusion of firing), without the necessity for scoring targets during the course of fire. Proficiency courses of fire must include tactically-relevant time constraints. Demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the actual weapon and assigned duty load, with alternate loads (e.g., frangible or dye-marking rounds), or with authorized weapons system simulators, as defined in this section. Proficiency courses of fire must be tactically relevant.

      is a formal test of weapons proficiency that includes, in addition to all specified elements of proficiency demonstration, the achievement of a prescribed qualification score according to a Departmentally-approved course of fire. _Weapons qualification_ courses of fire must be constrained by time.

      means a device that closely simulates all major aspects of employing the corresponding actual firearm/weapons system, without firing live ammunition. The simulator should permit all weapons-handling and operational actions required by the actual weapon, and should allow the use of sight settings similar to the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads. Additionally, when weapons or weapons system simulators are used for qualification testing of protective force officers, the operation of the simulated weapon must closely approximate all weapons handling and operational manipulation actions required by the actual weapon. The simulation system must precisely register on-target hits and misses with accuracy comparable to the actual weapon at the same shooting distances. The weight, balance, and sighting systems should closely replicate those of the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads, and noise signatures and felt recoil should be simulated to the extent technically feasible.

      is discussed by the Department of Labor in their Division of Federal Employees' Compensation Procedure Manual, 2-813-12 (available at ), as a physical therapy program which will facilitate return-to-work. _Work hardening_ is also known as an Occupational Rehabilitation Program.

      § 1046.13   Medical certification standards and procedures.

#### § § 1046.13

      (a)  All applicant and incumbent PF personnel must satisfy the applicable Medical Certification Standards set forth in this section.

      (b)  (1) The medical evaluation must be made by the Designated Physician without delegation (e.g., to a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner).

      (2) Evaluations of incumbent security police officers must include a medical history, the results of the examination, and a formal written determination.

      (3) A site standard form approved by EHSS-1 must be used, and pertinent negatives must be documented on the form.

      (4) The Medical Certification Standards are the minimum medical standards to be used in determining whether applicants and incumbent PF personnel can effectively perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, all essential functions of normal and emergency duties without imposing an undue hardship on the employer or posing a direct threat to the PF member or others, the facility, or the general public. All reasonable accommodations as defined in this part must be approved in writing by the PF contractor with a determination that the use of the device is compatible with all actions associated with emergency and protective equipment without creating a hardship for the contractor. The Designated Physician and PPMD must determine that the reasonable accommodation is consistent with the medical standard without creating a direct threat to the individual or to others.

      (c)  The examinee must possess the mental, sensorial, and motor skills to perform, safely and efficiently, all applicable essential job functions described in § 1046.11 and those designated in the current job analysis submitted by PF management to the Designated Physician/PPMD. Specific qualifications for SOs and SPOs are set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e), respectively, of this section. Reasonable accommodations shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of the ADAAA.

      (d) —(1)  Configuration suitable for fitting and effective use of personal protective equipment when the use of such equipment is required by assigned normal or emergency job duties.

      (2)  Ability to detect the odor of combustion products and of tracer or marker gases.

      (3)  Capacity for clear and audible speech as required for effective communications of the job.

      (4)  Hearing loss with or without aids not to exceed 30 decibels (db) average at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hertz (Hz), with no loss greater than 40 db at any one of these frequencies and the ability to localize sounds with a difference of not more than 15 db average loss between the two ears. If hearing aids are necessary, suitable testing procedures shall be used to ensure auditory acuity equivalent to the above requirement.

      (5)  Near and distant visual acuity, with or without correction, of at least 20/25 in one eye and no worse than 20/40 in the other eye.

      (6)  Ability to distinguish red, green, and yellow. Acceptable measures of color discrimination include the Ishihara; Hardy, Rand, & Rittler; and Dvorine pseudoisochromatic plates (PIP) when administered and scored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tinted lenses such as the X-Chrom contact lenses or tinted spectacle lenses effectively alter the standard illumination required for all color vision tests, thereby invalidating the results and are not permitted during color vision testing.

      (7)  Capacity to use a respirator other than self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) when required by local assignment.

      (8)  Ability to accommodate to changing work and meal schedules without potential or actual incapacity. Status adequate to meet the stresses and demands of assigned normal and emergency job duties.

      (e)  In addition to the criteria identified in § 1046.16(f), the following standards must be applied.

      (1)  Configuration suitable for fitting and effective use of personal protective equipment when the use of such equipment is required by assigned normal or emergency job duties.

      (2)  The ability to detect the odor of combustion products and of tracer or marker gases.

      (4)  Hearing loss without aids not to exceed 30 db average at 500, 1000, 2000 Hz, with no loss greater than 40 db at any of these frequencies and the ability to localize sounds with a difference of not more than 15 db average loss between the two ears. Hearing loss beyond indicated level would interfere with ability to function and respond to commands in emergency situations. Use of a hearing aid is allowed for one ear only with the remaining ear qualifying for no more than an average of 30 db loss at frequencies of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz. If a hearing aid is necessary, suitable testing procedures must be used to assure auditory acuity equivalent to the above requirement for the difference between two ears.

      (5)  (i) Near and distant vision. Near and distant visual acuity sufficient to effectively perform emergency-related essential functions:

      (A) With or without correction, vision of 20/25 or better in the better eye and 20/40 or better in the other eye.

      (B) If uncorrected, distant vision in the better eye is at least 20/25, and if the SPO wears corrective lenses, the SPO must carry an extra pair of corrective lenses.

      (ii)  Ability to distinguish red, green, and yellow. Acceptable measures of color discrimination include the Ishihara; Hardy, Rand, & Rittler; and Dvorine pseudoisochromatic plates (PIP) when administered and scored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tinted lenses such as the X-Chrom contact lenses or tinted spectacle lenses effectively alter the standard illumination required for all color vision tests, thereby invalidating the results and are not permitted during color vision testing.

      (iii)  Field of vision in the horizontal meridian at least a total of 140 degrees, contributed to by at least 70 degrees from each eye.

      (iv)  Ability to judge the distance of objects and the spatial relationship of objects at different distances.

      (6)  (i)  Capacity and reserve to perform physical exertion in emergencies at least equal to the demands of the job assignment. This must be measured by annual pulmonary function test, with no less than a 90 percent predicted forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. There must be no diagnosis of respiratory impairment requiring ongoing use of medications such as bronchodilators or beta agonists. A full review and approval by the PPMD is required whenever there is a past history of sleep apnea (with an established index of suspicion), with or without treatment.

      (ii)  (A) Capacity for tolerating physical exertion during emergencies. The results of the two semiannual assessments as identified in § 1046.16(b)(4) must be considered. Normal configuration and function, normal resting pulse, regular pulse without arrhythmia, full symmetrical pulses in extremities, and normotensive, with tolerance for rapid postural changes on rapid change from lying to standing position. The use of hypertensive medications is acceptable if there are no side effects present that would preclude adequate functions as herein specified.

      (B) If an examination reveals significant evidence of cardiovascular abnormality or significantly increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) as determined by the examining physician (e.g., by using the Framingham Point System), an evaluation by a specialist in internal medicine or cardiology may be required and evaluated by the Designated Physician. An electrocardiogram is required at entry, at age 40, and annually thereafter, which must be free from significant abnormality. If such abnormalities are detected, then a stress electrocardiogram with non-ischemic results must be provided, or the individual must be referred to a cardiologist for a fitness for duty examination. A stress electrocardiogram must be performed every other year beginning at age 50 with the results reviewed by the Designated Physician.

      (7)  Absence of central and peripheral nervous system conditions that could adversely affect ability to perform normal and emergency duties or to handle firearms safely. A test for peripheral neuropathy at fingers and toes is required annually. Absence of neurotic or psychotic conditions which would adversely affect the ability to handle firearms safely or to act safely and efficiently under normal and emergency conditions. Psychologists and psychiatrists identified to conduct evaluations, assessments, testing, and/or diagnoses associated with medical qualifications of this part must meet standards established by DOE.

      (8)  Absence of conditions that could reasonably be expected to interfere with the safe and effective performance of essential physical activities such as running, walking, crawling, climbing stairs, and standing for prolonged periods of time. All major joint range of motion limits must have no significant impairments in the performance of essential functions. This includes full range of motion to include overhead reaching and squatting. No history of spine surgery, a documented diagnosis of herniated disc, or mechanical back pain that has not been certified to have normal functional recovery with no activity limitations precluding the ability to perform SPO essential functions.

      (9)  Have no known significant abnormal intolerance to chemical, mechanical, and other physical agent exposures to the skin that may be encountered during routine and emergency duties, as specified at the site. Capability to tolerate use of personal protective covering and decontamination procedures when required by assigned job duties. Facial hair cannot be allowed to interfere with respirator fitting, and any such growth or a skin condition which could preclude respirator fit is not acceptable and must be documented.

      (10)  Ability to accommodate to changing work and meal schedules without potential or actual incapacity. Status adequate to meet the stresses and demands of assigned normal and emergency job duties. A full evaluation and approval of reasonable accommodation by the PPMD is required for hiring and retention when metabolic syndrome is identified and/or when diabetes is controlled by other than diet.

      (f)  For those facilities where it is necessary to determine the medical qualification of SPOs or SPO applicants to perform special assignment duties which might require exposure to unusually high levels of stress or physical exertion, Field Elements may develop more stringent medical qualification requirements or additional medical or physical tests, in collaboration with the PPMD, as necessary for such determinations. All such additional qualification requirements must be coordinated with the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security prior to application.

      (g)  (1) The medical examinations required for certification must be performed at the following intervals:

      (i) Applicants for PF member positions must undergo a comprehensive medical examination, as specified herein. The Director, Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security or designee, the Chief, Defense Nuclear Security in the case of NNSA, and/or the PPMD may require additional evaluations.

      (ii) After initial certification, each SO must be medically examined and recertified at least every two years or more often if the PPMD so requires. This initial certification date becomes the SO's anniversary date. Medical certification remains valid through 30 days beyond the anniversary date or for the period indicated by the PPMD if less than twenty-four months.

      (iii) After initial certification, each SPO must be medically examined and recertified every twelve months or more often (pursuant to § 1046.14 or otherwise if the PPMD so requires). This initial certification date becomes the SPO's anniversary date. Medical certification remains valid through 30 days from the anniversary date or for the time indicated by the PPMD if less than twelve months.

      (2) The medical examination must include a review of the essential functions of the job to which the individual is assigned. Medical examinations of SPO and SO applicants and incumbents must include the following evaluations to determine whether the individual meets the Medical Certification Standards for the applicable position:

      (i) An up to date medical and occupational history, complete physical examination, vision testing, audiometry, and spirometry. In addition, laboratory testing must be performed, including a complete blood count (CBC), basic blood chemistry, a fasting blood glucose, and a fasting lipid panel (the examination and testing is to identify baseline abnormalities, as well as trends); and

      (ii)(A) A psychologist or, as appropriate, a psychiatrist who meets standards established by DOE must be used to fulfill the requirements of this part. A personal, semi-structured interview at the time of the pre-placement medical evaluation and during the biennial (for SOs) or annual (for SPOs) examination must be conducted by a psychologist or, as appropriate, a psychiatrist. At the pre-placement medical examination and every third year for SPOs and every fourth year for SOs thereafter, a Minnesota Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) (available only to appropriate medical professionals at, e.g., ) or its revised form must be administered in order to:

      () Establish a baseline psychological profile;

      () Monitor for the development of abnormalities; and

      () Qualify and quantify abnormalities.

      (B) The information gathered from paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, together with the results of the semi-structured interview of this paragraph, psychiatric evaluations (if required), and reviews of job performance may indicate disqualifying medical or psychological conditions. Additional generally-accepted psychological testing may be performed as required to substantiate findings of the MMPI. If medically indicated and approved by the PPMD, an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist who meets standards established by DOE may be conducted. Additional or more frequent psychological evaluations as determined by the psychologist, psychiatrist, Designated Physician, or the PPMD may be required. Unless otherwise indicated, a psychological evaluation performed in accordance with the other DOE requirements (e.g., pursuant to 10 CFR part 712) may satisfy the requirements of this part.

      (C) The Designated Physician may request any additional medical examination, test, consultation or evaluation deemed necessary to evaluate a candidate or an incumbent SO's or SPO's ability to perform essential job duties or for incumbents, the need for temporary work restrictions.

      (3) When an examinee needs the use of corrective devices, such as eyeglasses or hearing aids, to enable the examinee to successfully meet medical qualification requirements, the contractor responsible for the examinee's performance must make a determination that the use of any such device is compatible with all required emergency and protective equipment that the examinee may be required to wear or use while performing assigned job duties. The Designated Physician and the PPMD must determine that the reasonable accommodation is consistent with the medical standard and will not result in a direct threat to the individual or to others. This determination must be made before such corrective devices may be used by the examinee to meet the medical, physical readiness, or training requirements for a particular position.

      (4) Contractor management must provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified individual by taking reasonable steps to modify required emergency and protective equipment to be compatible with corrective devices or by providing equally effective, alternate equipment, if available.

      (5) The Designated Physician must discuss the results of the medical and physical readiness examinations with the individual. The results of the medical examinations also must be communicated in writing to PF management and to the individual and must include:

      (i) A statement of the certification status of the individual, including any essential functions for which the individual is not qualified, with or without reasonable accommodations, and an assessment of whether the individual would present a direct threat to self or others in the position at issue;

      (ii) If another medical appointment is required, the date of the next medical appointment; and

      (iii) Recommended remedial programs or other measures that may restore the individual's ability to perform the essential functions or may negate the direct threat concern, if the individual is not approved for physical training, testing, or the relevant position.

      (6) The PF contractor must offer a health status exit review for all employees leaving PF service. If the employee desires the review, it must be conducted by the PPMD or Designated Physician. The review, which may be conducted in conjunction with the requirements of other parts, must include all of the medical standards for the PF position being vacated. The reason(s) for any health status exit review not being performed must be documented (e.g., employee declined to have the review conducted).

      § 1046.14   Medical certification disqualification.

#### § § 1046.14

      (a)  An incumbent SO or SPO is disqualified from medical certification by the PPMD if one or more of the medical certification standards contained in § 1046.13 are not met. An incumbent SO or SPO temporarily or permanently disqualified from medical certification by the PPMD must be removed from those protective force duties by the employer when the employer is notified by the PPMD of such a determination.

      (b)  The employer of a disqualified SPO must offer the SPO medical removal protection if the PPMD determines in a written medical opinion that the disqualifying condition occurred as a result of site-approved training for or attempting to meet a physical readiness standard qualification, or site-approved training for security and emergency response (e.g., participating in force-on-force exercises for training, inspection, or validation purposes). The PPMD's determination must be based on an examining physician's recommendation or any other signs or symptoms that the Designated Physician deems medically sufficient to medically disqualify an SPO. The employee pay benefits specified in this section for combined temporary and permanent medical removal shall not be provided for more than one year from the date of the initial PPMD written determination regarding the same basis for disqualification.

      (1)  (i) The employer of a disqualified SPO must offer the SPO temporary medical removal from PF duties on each occasion that the PPMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be temporarily removed from such duties pending a final medical determination of whether the SPO should be removed permanently, if appropriate. “Final medical determination” means the outcome of the Independent Review provided for in § 1046.15(c) or, if one is held, the Final Review provided for in § 1046.15(d).

      (ii) If an SPO is temporarily removed from PF duties pursuant to this section, the SPO's employer must not remove the employee from the payroll unless available alternative duties for which the worker is qualified or can be trained in a short period of time are refused or performed unsatisfactorily.

      (iii) While the SPO remains on the payroll pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the SPO's employer must maintain the SPO's total base pay (overtime not included), seniority, and other site-specific worker rights and benefits (e.g., corporate benefit package and collective bargaining agreement benefits) as if the worker had not been removed. Funds reimbursable by the DOE which are provided to a SPO under medical removal protection must be reduced dollar for dollar for any other PF related pay or monetary benefit for associated lost earnings, including those negotiated through collective bargaining and from workers compensation. Medical removal protection in conjunction with these other benefits must not exceed the SPO's total base pay.

      (iv) If there are no suitable alternative duties available as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the SPO's employer must provide to the SPO the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section until alternative duties become available, the SPO has recovered, or one year has elapsed from the date of the PPMD's determination that the SPO should be temporarily removed from duties, whichever comes first. During this period the SPO may be placed on administrative leave when alternative duties are not available.

      (2)  (i) If the PPMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be permanently removed from PF duties as a result of injuries sustained while engaging in required physical readiness activities (i.e., site approved training for or attempting to meet a physical readiness standard qualification or site approved training for security or emergency response), employer Human Resources policies, disability insurance, and/or collective bargaining agreements will dictate employment status and compensation beyond the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (ii) If an SPO has been permanently removed from duty pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the SPO's employer must provide the SPO the opportunity to transfer to another available position, or one which later becomes available, for which the SPO is qualified (or for which the SPO can be trained in a short period), subject to collective bargaining agreements, as applicable.

      (3)  If the PPMD determines that an SPO should be temporarily or permanently removed from PF duties, the PPMD must:

      (i) Advise the SPO of the determination that medical removal is necessary to protect the SPO's health and well-being or prevent the SPO from being a hazard to self or others;

      (ii) Provide the SPO the opportunity to have any medical questions concerning medical removal answered; and

      (iii) Obtain the SPO's signature or document that the SPO has been advised on the provisions of medical removal as provided in this section and the risks of continued participation in physically demanding positions.

      (4)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the SPO's employer must not return an SPO, who has been granted medical removal protection under this section, to the SPO's former job status.

      (ii) If, in the PPMD's opinion, continued participation in PF duties will not pose an increased risk to the SPO's health and well-being or an increased risk (beyond those normally associated with SPO duties) of the SPO being a direct threat to self or others, the PPMD must fully discuss these matters with the SPO and then, in a written determination, may authorize the SPO's employer to return the SPO to former job status. Within one year from the PPMD's original decision to remove the individual from SPO status and subject to the SPO's ability to meet all other position related requirements (e.g., weapons qualifications, physical readiness standard, human reliability program, and refresher training), the employer must return the SPO to duty status given PPMD authorization to return to work. For durations beyond one year from the original decision given PPMD authorization to return to work, return to SPO status will be at the employer's discretion.

      (c)  (1) If required by this section to provide medical removal protection benefits, the SPO's employer must maintain for not more than one year, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the removed worker's total base pay, and seniority, as though the SPO had not been removed. The total base pay provision in this section must be reduced by any compensation for lost earnings provided by any other benefit or those negotiated through collective bargaining for both temporary and permanent removal protection as provided by this section.

      (2) If a removed SPO files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a physical disability, then the SPO's employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits until disposition of the claim, recovery of the claimant, or one year from the date the removal protection began, whichever comes first. If workers' compensation benefits are provided retroactively then the SPO must reimburse the employer to the extent the SPO is compensated for lost earnings for the same period that the medical removal protection benefits are received for both temporary and permanent removal protection as provided by this section. Expenses for medical/rehabilitation treatments related to the basis for medical removal protection are not covered under this part.

      (3) The SPO's employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to an SPO is reduced to the extent that the worker receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or site employer-funded compensation program.

      (d)  For the purposes of this section, the requirement that the SPO's employer provide medical removal protection benefits is not intended to expand upon, restrict, or change any rights to a specific job classification or position under the terms of an applicable existing collective bargaining agreement.

      § 1046.15   Review of medical certification disqualification.

#### § § 1046.15

      (a)  Should the PPMD determine that an individual is disqualified from medical certification because of a temporary medical or physical condition which results in the individual not being able to perform any of the essential functions of the job classification, the employer may assign the individual to alternate, limited duty, if available, until the individual is again medically certified by the PPMD. However, this limited duty may only include assignment to duties in a job classification where all essential functions for that job classification can be safely and efficiently performed. Medical certification is required to remain in armed status. A temporary medical certification disqualification may not exceed a period of twelve months regardless of whether medical removal protection is authorized. Before the end of the twelve-month period, the PPMD must determine whether the individual is permanently disqualified from medical certification because of a continuing medical or physical condition which results in the individual not being able to perform all essential functions of the job classification. The individual may request an Independent Review of the disqualification at any time the twelve-month period.

      (b)  If the PPMD determines that an individual is disqualified from medical certification because of a permanent medical or physical condition which results in the individual not being able to perform all essential functions of the job classification, and the individual requests an Independent Review, the employer may assign the individual to alternate, limited duty, if available. This limited duty may include assignment to duties in any job classification where all essential functions can be safely and efficiently performed. Subject to the one year limit as identified in § 1046.14, assignment to alternate, limited duty, may remain in effect until an Independent Review determination, and if applicable, the Final Review determination by the DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals.

      (c)  An individual PF member disqualified from medical certification, temporarily or permanently, by the PPMD may request an Independent Review of the case. The individual initiating such a review must submit the request for an Independent Review in writing to EHSS-1 within ten working days of the date of notification (date of written correspondence) of disqualification. A copy of the request must be sent to the individual's employer and to the local ODFSA: for DOE HQ sites, to the Director, Office of Security Operations; for NNSA sites, to the cognizant NNSA Security Director; and for any other DOE sites, to the cognizant DOE Security Director.

      (1) EHSS-1, in coordination with the respective PPMD, must provide for the Independent Review. The Independent Review must be conducted within sixty calendar days of the receipt of the request for an Independent Review. The Independent Review must include a complete review of the record of the case.

      (2) The disqualified individual may select a representative during the Independent Review process. The individual or representative may provide additional evidence relating solely to the medical or physical readiness of the individual. The individual must execute a consent document authorizing the release of relevant medical information to EHSS-1.

      (3) The disqualified individual must provide a copy of the request for Independent Review and the signed consent document for the release of medical information to the respective PPMD and the individual's employer within ten working days of the submission of the request to EHSS-1.

      (4) Within ten working days of receipt of a copy of the request for an Independent Review, the disqualified individual's employer must provide EHSS-1 with the following:

      (i) A copy of the job analysis (JA)/mission essential task list (METL) available to the respective Designated Physician at the time of the individual's medical evaluation;

      (ii) A listing of the essential functions for the individual's PF job classification; and

      (iii) Any additional information relating to the medical or physical readiness of the requestor that EHSS-1 may request.

      (5) EHSS-1 must provide the information in paragraph (c)(4) of this section to the Independent Physician for use in the independent review.

      (6) A medical examination of the disqualified individual must be conducted by an Independent Physician approved by EHSS-1. The Independent Physician must not have served as the requestor's personal physician in any capacity or have been previously involved in the requestor's case on behalf of the Department or a Department contractor. The Independent Review must confirm or disagree with the medical certification disqualification and must consider:

      (i) The validity of the stated physical requirements and essential function(s) for the applicable job classification;

      (ii) The PPMD's medical determination of the individual's inability to perform essential functions or to undertake training or the physical readiness qualification test without undue medical risk to the health and safety of the individual;

      (iii) The completeness of the medical information available to the PPMD; and

      (iv) If applicable, the determination by the PPMD that the performance of the individual poses a direct threat to self or others.

      (7) The results of the Independent Physician's medical examination of the individual must be provided to EHSS-1 for review. EHSS-1 must then recommend a final determination confirming or reversing the medical certification disqualification. The recommendation of EHSS-1 must be forwarded to the applicable local ODFSA (for DOE HQ sites, the Director, Office of Security Operations; for NNSA sites, the cognizant local NNSA Security Director; and for any other DOE sites, the cognizant local DOE Security Director) and the respective PPMD. This individual will either adopt or reject the recommendation of EHSS-1.

      (8) EHSS-1 must provide the results of the Independent Review and the final determination regarding the individual's medical disqualification to the requestor, the respective PPMD, the respective local ODFSA, and the requestor's employer.

      (9) If the Independent Review determination confirms the individual is disqualified from medical certification, the individual must be removed from the PF job classification by the individual's employer. If the Independent Review disagrees with the medical certification disqualification, the individual must be reinstated to the PF job classification by the individual's employer, subject to successful completion of any required qualifications or training requirements that were due during the temporary disqualification, and subject to subsequent annual medical examinations and the ability to meet applicable physical readiness requirements.

      (d)  An individual receiving an unfavorable Independent Review Determination may request a Final Review of the Independent Review Determination by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The individual must submit a request for a Final Review to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, in writing, within 30 days of receiving an unfavorable determination, and notify EHSS-1 of the request for appeal. In the request for a Final Review, the individual must state with specificity the basis for disagreement with the Independent Review confirming the medical certification disqualification. EHSS-1 must transmit the complete record in the case to the Office of Hearings and Appeals within five business days of receiving notice from the individual that the SPO has filed an appeal of the Independent Review Determination. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may request additional information, if necessary, to clarify any issue on appeal. Within 45 days of the closing of the record, the Office of Hearings and Appeals must issue a Decision and Order setting forth its findings on appeal and its conclusions based on the record before it. Upon receipt of an unfavorable Final Review decision by the Office of Hearings and Appeals, the individual must be permanently removed from that PF job classification, SO or SPO (FPRS, BRS, ARS, or SRT member) by the employer. However, nothing in the Final Review decision shall prevent the employee from being allowed to qualify for a less strenuous physical readiness job classification given the availability of said position, subject to successful completion of any other required qualifications or training requirements. Upon receipt of a favorable Final Review decision from the Office of Hearings and Appeals, the individual must be reinstated to the PF job classification by the employer, subject to successful completion of any required qualifications or training requirements due during the temporary disqualification, and future ability to be medically certified for the PF job classification and to meet applicable physical readiness standards.

> [78 FR 55184, Sept. 10, 2013, as amended at 80 FR 57083, Sept. 22, 2015; 88 FR 41295, June 26, 2023]

      § 1046.16   SPO physical readiness qualification standards and procedures.

#### § § 1046.16

      (a)  Employers must ensure SPOs have access to their applicable physical readiness standard and the provisions of this part. Employers must also inform SPOs of their rights associated with the physical readiness requirements.

      (1) All SPO applicants must satisfy the applicable physical readiness standard for their assigned position and must physically demonstrate the physical training and knowledge, skills, and abilities set out in paragraph (g) of this section, as required for their assigned position before beginning active duty in that position.

      (2) All incumbent SPOs must re-qualify every year according to their applicable readiness standard, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1), (f), or (g) of this section. Re-qualification must occur no earlier than 30 days prior to and no later than 30 days following the SPOs anniversary date. The actual date of re-qualification does not affect the anniversary date under this section.

      (3) All qualification and re-qualification activities must be conducted under the supervision of personnel knowledgeable of DOE physical readiness program requirements as approved by the local ODFSA.

      (b)  SPOs must maintain physical readiness standards on a continuing basis. Each SPO must engage in a year-round physical readiness training program consistent with paragraph (c)(2) and (3) of this section to:

      (1) Achieve and maintain the cardio-respiratory and musculoskeletal fitness necessary to safely perform, without posing a direct threat to self or others, all essential functions of normal and emergency PF duties at any time; and

      (2) Enable the individual SPO to pass (on an annual basis) the applicable SPO physical readiness standard without any undue risk of physical injury.

      (c)  (1) The training program must include the following elements:

      (i) Activities with appropriate durations specific to the physical readiness standard, which appropriately address aerobic, agility, flexibility, and strength conditioning.

      (ii) Instruction on techniques and exercises designed to ensure SPOs can safely rise quickly from the prone position, and if required by qualification standard, transition into a run.

      (iii) Appropriate warm-up and cool down activities designed by exercise physiologists to support injury free workouts and physical readiness testing.

      (2) An SPO physical readiness training and maintenance program must be developed by the employing organization in consultation with the PPMD and the local ODFSA.

      (3) After initial training and qualification, each SPO must participate in the physical readiness training and maintenance program on a continuing basis. The physical readiness maintenance program must be based on assessment of the individual SPO's physical readiness levels and be tailored to the individual SPO's physical readiness maintenance requirements and improvement needs. Whether training is conducted on or off site, the SPO's participation must be documented.

      (4) Assessments of an SPO's level of physical readiness must be conducted at least semiannually by personnel knowledgeable of DOE requirements. The results of the assessments must be provided to the Designated Physician. The assessments must include recognized assessment standard values for aerobic capacity (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine [], Cooper Fitness Institute [], or Rockport Walk Protocol [available online from a variety of Web sites]). Though not a qualification, the assessment report must include an evaluation of the SPO's level of physical readiness and provide recommendations for maintenance requirements and improvement needs, if any. Ability to summon appropriate medical emergency response with the capability of responding within a reasonable time must be available at the assessment site. An individual trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and automatic external defibrillator equipment must be present.

      (5) No additional training or time extension to meet the standards is permitted except for unusual circumstances based on a temporary medical or physical condition as certified by the PPMD that causes the SPO to be unable to satisfy the physical readiness standards within the required time period without suffering undue physical harm. An SPO who fails to re-qualify must be removed from armed SPO status and must participate in a remedial physical readiness training program, as specified in paragraphs (g)(8) and (9) of this section.

      (6) An SPO may be required to demonstrate the ability to meet the applicable physical readiness qualification standard during a Headquarters or field audit/inspection/survey or other similar activity, as directed by the local ODFSA. Failure to meet the physical readiness standard must be treated as if the SPO failed the first attempt during routine qualification, and the procedures of paragraphs (g)(5) and (8) of this section apply. An SPO who fails to demonstrate the standard must be removed from armed status.

      (7) Employees must notify the employer when the requirements of the training program cannot be successfully completed on a recurring basis (e.g., exercises cannot be completed and/or completed within time limits several times in a row due to injury and/or conditioning issues).

      (8) When a physical readiness deficiency is first identified, the employer must provide the SPO access to remedial training or, based upon PPMD evaluation validating the medical need, to a work hardening or rehabilitation program.

      (d)  Any failure, at any time, by an SPO to physically demonstrate ability to meet the required physical readiness standard, must result in temporary removal from being authorized to perform the functions of that standard. The physical readiness standards for SPOs are as follows:

      (1)  This qualification standard applies to all SPOs. Regardless of an SPO's physical readiness category, the FPRS must be physically demonstrated every year by all SPOs.

      (i) The standard requires sufficient agility and range of motion to: Assume, maintain, and recover from the variety of cover positions associated with effective use of firearms at entry portals and similar static environments to include prone, standing, kneeling, and barricade positions; use site-specific deadly and intermediate force weapons and employ weaponless self-defense techniques; effect arrests of suspects and place them under restraint, e.g., with handcuffs or other physical restraint devices; and meet any other measure of physical readiness necessary to perform site-specific essential functions as prescribed by site management and approved by the respective program office.

      (ii) A stand-alone qualification test which requires the demonstration of all of the required elements (both general and site-specific, if applicable) must be developed and maintained by each site and approved by the ODFSA. This qualification test can be used for annual qualification, or sites may choose to document an SPO's ability to meet specific elements of the standard during annual refresher training sessions and/or during weapons qualification activities. All elements of this standard must be demonstrated annually in the aggregate.

      (iii) The results must be provided to the Designated Physician prior to the annual medical examination. Inability to physically demonstrate the FPRS requirements must result in temporary loss of SPO status. Remedial training must be provided pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (g)(8) of this section.

      (2)  In addition to demonstrating the FPRS requirements as stated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the BRS qualification consists of a one-half mile run with a maximum qualifying time of 4 minutes 40 seconds and a 40-yard dash from the prone position in 8.5 seconds or less, and any other site-specific measure of physical readiness necessary to perform essential functions as prescribed by site management and approved by the respective program office. The running elements and other site-specific measures of the BRS must be demonstrated on the same day.

      (3)  In addition to demonstrating the FPRS requirements as stated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the ARS qualification consists of a one mile run with a maximum qualifying time of 8 minutes 30 seconds, and a 40-yard dash from the prone position in 8.0 seconds or less, and any other site-specific measure of physical readiness necessary to perform site-specific essential functions as prescribed by site management and approved by the respective program office. The running elements and other site-specific measures of the ARS must be demonstrated on the same day.

      (e)  The Department may revise the physical readiness standards or establish new standards consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law.

      (f)  Two distinct determinations must be made by the Designated Physician for BRS and ARS SPOs. First, a medical examination that meets the requirements of § 1046.13(g) must be conducted. A written determination must be made whether the SPO is medically certified for SPO duties without being a danger to self or others. This includes being able to attempt to physically demonstrate the applicable physical readiness standard. Given a favorable medical clearance determination, the second determination assesses the SPO's physical readiness capability by comparing the SPO's current examination results, medical history, normative data, past qualifying times, and the results of physical assessments. The Designated Physician's evaluation and documentation that an incumbent BRS or ARS SPO has reasonable expectation of meeting the appropriate physical readiness standard is deemed to have met the annual physical readiness qualification requirement without having to take the appropriate BRS or ARS test unless the SPO is randomly selected pursuant to paragraph (f)(7) of this section. Physician extenders (e.g., physician's assistants, certified occupational health nurses, or nurse practitioners) and exercise physiologists may perform appropriate elements of the physical examination and the physical assessments required in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. However, both the medical clearance determination and the formal physical readiness capability evaluation must be made by the Designated Physician without delegation. A site standard form must be used, and pertinent negatives must be documented on the form. The following procedures apply regarding the Designated Physician's evaluation and documentation that an incumbent BRS or ARS SPO has a reasonable expectation of meeting the appropriate physical readiness standard.

      (1) Evaluation of BRS and ARS SPOs must include consideration of past medical history and normative data when available for individuals deemed to be physically capable. The following criteria must be evaluated: Cardiac function to include resting pulse rate and pulse recovery after exertion; neuromuscular function to include assessments of strength, range/freedom of motion, and movement without pain. While they are not required to be used or intended to be the sole determining criterion, for Designated Physicians using metabolic equivalents (METS) data the following values may be included in the overall process to determine if an individual SPO has a reasonable expectation of being able to physically demonstrate the appropriate physical readiness standard.

      (i) For BRS SPOs a METS value of seven or greater would be a positive indicator of sufficient aerobic capacity to successfully demonstrate the half mile run associated with the BRS.

      (ii) For ARS SPOs a METS value of 12 or greater would be a positive indicator of sufficient aerobic capacity to successfully demonstrate the mile run associated with the ARS.

      (2) The designated physician may medically certify the BRS or ARS SPO for SPO duties and document that the SPO has a reasonable expectation of meeting the appropriate physical readiness standard. In this case, the SPO is deemed to have met the annual physical readiness qualification requirement without having to take the appropriate BRS or ARS test, unless the SPO is randomly selected pursuant to paragraph (f)(7) of this section.

      (3) The designated physician may indicate the BRS or ARS SPO meets medical standards for SPO duties, but also indicate that the SPO does not appear to have the physical capability to pass the appropriate physical readiness test. In this case, the file must be immediately forwarded to the PPMD for review.

      (4) If the PPMD concurs with the Designated Physician that the SPO does not have a reasonable expectation of being able to meet the readiness standard, the SPO may request to attempt to demonstrate the appropriate physical readiness test, which must be accomplished successfully within 30 days of the date of the medical certification for the SPO to remain in status. If the SPO chooses not to attempt to demonstrate the readiness standard, then the SPO must be removed immediately from duties associated with that physical readiness standard. Should the SPO fail to meet the standard, the retesting process described below in paragraph (g) of this section must be followed. Ultimate return to duties associated with that standard would require following the new hire process of medical clearance for SPO duties and then physically demonstrating the readiness standard which had not been met.

      (5) Should the PPMD determine that the SPO does appear to have a reasonable expectation of meeting the appropriate physical readiness standard, the SPO is deemed to have met the annual qualification requirement for the appropriate physical readiness standard.

      (6) The Designated Physician may find that the SPO cannot be medically certified for SPO duties. In this case, the SPO must be removed from armed status with appropriate PPMD review and medical intervention recommendations.

      (7) Each year, 10 percent of the BRS and ARS SPO populations (supervisors included) at each site must be randomly selected by the employer and physically tested pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. At the beginning of the testing year as established by each site, the site must ensure that a sufficient number of individuals and alternates are selected in one drawing to ensure that the 10 percent testing requirement can be achieved even though some SPOs selected may not receive a reasonable expectation determination for the Designated Physician as identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Once 10 percent of the SPOs successfully demonstrating the standard has been achieved, the remaining alternates are not required to be physically tested unless they do not receive a reasonable expectation determination. The identity of an individual as a selectee for testing shall be kept confidential by the employer in a manner that ensures this information does not become known to the selected individual, the PPMD, and the Designated Physician until after the individual SPO has been deemed to have a reasonable expectation of meeting the appropriate physical readiness standard pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) or (5) of this section. The selected individuals must successfully complete the applicable physical readiness standard to retain SPO status. During a given year's testing, at least 90 percent of those tested in each physical readiness category must meet the requirements.

      (8)(i) Should the passing percentage of those randomly selected and attempting to physically demonstrate the standard in a particular physical readiness category at a particular site drop below 90 percent (on the first attempt) then all SPOs in that category at that site must be tested on their ability to physically demonstrate the standard. The following parameters apply.

      (A) All percentages are based upon first attempts.

      (B) The total population of SPOs (supervisors included) in that physical readiness category at the beginning of that testing year at that site must be used to determine the percentage thresholds.

      (C) The 100 percent testing of SPOs in that category must commence immediately upon the failure that renders achievement of a 90 percent success rate mathematically impossible for that readiness category during that testing year. The date of this failure will establish the anniversary date of the new testing year.

      (D) An insufficient number of randomly selected individuals and alternates available to constitute the 10 percent selection criterion represents a failure to achieve the 90 percent threshold. Identification of additional randomly selected individuals for that testing year is not authorized.

      (ii) The 100 percent testing described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section must continue for a minimum of 365 days. With a 95 percent successful demonstration rate of the standard over the year, 10 percent testing may return at the beginning of the new testing year.

      (iii) Should 95 percent successful demonstration not be achieved in the 365 days of 100 percent testing, the 100 percent testing described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section must continue for the next 365 days under the conditions specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i)(A) through (D) of this section. This process must be repeated until 95 percent successful demonstration is achieved.

      (g)  The following procedures apply to an individual physically demonstrating the physical readiness standards for applicants and incumbent SPOs.

      (1) Incumbent BRS and ARS SPOs randomly selected for physical testing pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section in any given year shall physically meet the applicable physical readiness standard within 30 days of their anniversary date.

      (2) Incumbent SPOs shall physically meet the applicable physical readiness standard prior to their assignment to duties which require a more stringent standard.

      (3) All newly hired SPOs must physically meet the most stringent standard required at the site.

      (4) SPOs returning after an absence from protective force duties which encompasses their anniversary date must physically meet at least the standard they were required to meet when they left SPO duties, should such a position requiring that standard be available.

      (5) Each applicant and incumbent SPO must be medically approved by the Designated Physician within thirty days prior to initial participation in any physical readiness training program and prior to attempting the applicable standard to determine whether the individual can undertake the standard without undue medical risk to the health and safety of the individual. Incumbents also must have successfully completed a physical readiness assessment within thirty days prior to their annual physical examination by the Designated Physician.

      (6) Incumbent SPOs must qualify on the applicable standard annually by physically passing the required test if they have not received a reasonable expectation determination as described in paragraph (f) of this section. The testing protocol shall include mandated participation by the SPO being tested in pre-test warm-up and post-test cool-down activities as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The responsible person in charge of the qualification activity must inform the SPO that the attempt will be for qualification. Once this has been communicated by the person in charge, the attempt will constitute a qualification attempt. Ability to summon appropriate medical emergency response with the capability of responding within a reasonable time must be available at the testing site. An individual trained in cardio pulmonary resuscitation and automatic external defibrillator equipment must be present.

      (7) Physical readiness re-qualification for randomly selected incumbent SPOs must occur not more than 30 days from the anniversary date. Failure to qualify within 30 days past the anniversary date must result in removal from SPO status for that physical readiness category. Not more than five attempts may be allowed during the 30-day period. All attempts must be made within 30 days of the medical approval required in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.

      (8) Remedial training program: If an SPO fails all attempts pursuant to paragraph (g)(7) of this section for reasons other than injury or illness, the PF contractor must offer the SPO the opportunity to participate in a supervised physical readiness remedial training program developed by an exercise physiologist.

      (i) Supervision of the physical readiness remedial training program may be accomplished by direct observation of the SPO during the training program by personnel knowledgeable of Department physical readiness program requirements, or by these personnel monitoring the SPO's progress on a weekly basis.

      (ii) The remedial training program must be based upon an assessment of the SPO's individual physical readiness deficiencies and improvement needs which precluded the SPO from successfully completing the applicable physical readiness standard.

      (iii) The remedial training program must not exceed a period of 30 days.

      (9) Re-testing of incumbent SPOs after completion of remedial training program.

      (i) Once an SPO has begun a remedial training program, it must be completed before the SPO may attempt the applicable standard.

      (ii) Upon completion of the remedial training the ARS/BRS SPO must be offered an assessment using the same process that is used for the required semiannual assessment as required in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Any deficiencies and improvement needs must be identified to the SPO.

      (iii) The SPO has seven days from the completion date of the remedial training program to meet the applicable physical readiness qualification standard. Only one attempt during this seven-day period may be made unless circumstances beyond the testing organization or participant's control (e.g., severe weather, equipment failure, or injury as determined by the employer) interrupt the attempt. When the attempt is interrupted, the employer may reschedule it within seven days.

      (iv) If the SPO meets the standard on the attempt specified in paragraph (f)(9)(iii) of this section, the original anniversary qualification date remains the same.

      (v) Failure to meet the standard must result in the SPO being permanently removed from duties requiring ability to meet that physical readiness standard.

      (vi) If an SPO requires remedial training during three consecutive annual qualification periods, then a fourth remediation shall not be offered for subsequent failures to achieve the physical readiness standard. The SPO must be permanently removed from duties requiring ability to meet that physical readiness standard.

      (10) The physical readiness standards set forth in this part may not be waived or exempted. Additional time, not to exceed six months, may be granted on a case-by-case basis for those individuals who, because of a temporary medical condition or physical injury certified by the Designated Physician, are unable to satisfy the physical readiness standards within the required period without suffering injury. Additional time totaling more than one year may not be granted. When additional time is granted:

      (i) The granting of such time does not eliminate the requirement for the incumbent SPO to be removed from that SPO physical readiness standard status during the time extension.

      (ii) When additional time is granted because of an inability to qualify without a certified medical condition or injury, the PF member is not entitled to temporary removal protection benefits. Granting additional time due to deconditioning is not authorized.

      (iii) Upon completion of the additional time period and requisite physical readiness training, as applicable, the incumbent SPO must be assessed using the same process that is used for the semiannual assessment as required in paragraph (c)(4) of this section if the results indicate the SPO is ready to take the test. The test must be taken within 30 days of medical clearance as described in § 1046.13(g).

      (iv) For a duration exceeding three months, the SPO's original anniversary qualification date may be revised at the discretion of the employer to reflect the most recent date that the SPO qualified under the applicable standard, which will become the new anniversary qualification date.

      § 1046.17   Training standards and procedures.

#### § § 1046.17

      (a) Department contractors responsible for the management of PF personnel must establish training programs and procedures for PF members to develop and maintain the knowledge, skills and abilities required to perform assigned tasks. The site-specific qualification and training programs must be based upon criteria approved by the ODFSA.

      (b) Department contractors responsible for training PF personnel must prepare and annually review mission essential tasks from which a JA or mission essential task list (METL) is developed. The JAs or METLs must be prepared detailing the required actions or functions for each specific PF job assignment. When a generic Department JA or METL does not exist for a site-specific PF assignment (e.g., dog handler, investigator, flight crew, pilot, etc.) the site must develop a site-specific JA or METL. The JA or METL must be used as the basis for local site-specific training programs.

      (c) The Designated Physician must approve in advance the participation by individuals in training and examinations of training prior to an individual's beginning employment as a PF member and annually thereafter.

      (d) The formal PF training program must:

      (1) Be based on identified essential functions and job tasks, with identified levels of knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform the tasks required by a specific position;

      (2) Be aimed at achieving at least a well-defined, minimum level of competency required to perform each essential function and task acceptably, with or without reasonable accommodations;

      (3) Employ standardized instructional guidelines, based on approved curricula, with clear performance objectives as the basis for instruction;

      (4) Include valid performance-based testing to determine and certify job readiness;

      (5) Be documented so that individual and overall training status is easily accessible. Individual training records and certifications must be retained for at least one year after termination of the employee from employment as a member of the PF;

      (6) Incorporate the initial and maintenance training and training exercise requirements expressly set forth in this part and as otherwise required by DOE;

      (7) Be reviewed and revised, as applicable, by PF management on an annual basis; and

      (8) Be reviewed and approved by the local ODFSA on an annual basis.

      (e) —(1)  (i) Prior to initial assignment to duty, unless they previously have been employed as an SPO at the same DOE facility, each SO must successfully complete a basic SO training course, approved by the local ODFSA, designed to provide the knowledge, skills, and ability needed to competently perform all essential functions and tasks associated with SO job responsibilities.

      (ii) The essential functions and minimum competency levels must be determined by a site-specific JA or METL. The essential functions and minimum competency levels must include, but are not limited to, the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the essential functions set forth in this part; task areas as specified by DOE; and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SO or to others.

      (2)  Each SO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of tasks and essential functions associated with SO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be based on a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SO's placement in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SO with the necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the job analysis. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SO status.

      (3)  Each SO must possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to protect Department security interests from the theft, sabotage, and other acts that may harm national security, the facility, its employees, or the health and safety of the public. The requirements for each SO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the knowledge, skills, and abilities and the responsibilities necessary to perform the essential functions of the job must be based on the JA or METL.

      (f) —(1 Prior to initial assignment to duty, in addition to meeting SO training requirements described above in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each SPO must successfully complete the approved Department basic SPO training course. _SPOs_ who are rehired at the same DOE facility or who have worked as an SPO at another DOE facility are not required to retake the basic training course as determined by a site-specific assessment of the individual. In addition to the basic SPO training course, SPO initial training must include successful completion of site-specific training objectives derived from a site-specific JA or METL, task areas as specified by DOE, and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SPO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SPO or to others.

      (2)  In addition to meeting the SO maintenance training requirements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each SPO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of essential functions and tasks associated with SPO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be determined by a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SPO being placed in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL within clearly established time frames. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SPO status.

      (3)  In addition to meeting the SO knowledge, skills and ability requirements described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the requirements for each SPO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the individual and collective knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the essential functions and the job tasks must be based on their applicable JA or METL.

      (g)  In addition to satisfying the initial and maintenance training requirements for SPOs and meeting the SPO knowledge, skill, and ability requirements, SRT members must meet the following requirements.

      (1)  Prior to initial assignment to duty, each SRT-qualified SPO must successfully complete the current Department-approved SRT basic qualification course designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, and ability needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with SRT job responsibilities. SPOs who have previously successfully completed the SRT basic qualification course to work at another DOE facility do not have to retake the SRT basic qualification as determined by a site-specific assessment of the individual. After completion of the SRT basic qualification course, the SRT-qualified SPO must participate in a site-specific training program designed to provide the minimum level of knowledge and skills needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with site-specific SRT job responsibilities. The site-specific essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL, task areas as specified by DOE, and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SRT-qualified SPO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SPO or to others.

      (2)  After assignment to duties as a member of an SRT, an SRT-qualified SPO must receive maintenance training annually on each area required by a site-specific JA or METL. The annual maintenance training program must be completed over two or more sessions appropriately spaced throughout the year. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SRT-qualified SPO being placed in a remedial training program or removal from SRT qualification status, as determined by contractor management. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SRT-qualified SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SRT-qualification status.

      (3)  The requirements for each SRT-qualified SPO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the individual and collective knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the job tasks must include, but are not limited to, those identified for SPOs and based on their applicable JA or METL.

      (h)  PF personnel who are assigned specialized PF responsibilities outside the scope of normal duties must successfully complete the appropriate basic and maintenance training, as required by DOE and other applicable governing regulating authorities (e.g., Federal Aviation Administration). This training must enable the individual to achieve and maintain at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, ability needed to competently perform the tasks associated with the specialized job responsibilities, as well as maintain mandated certification, when applicable. Such personnel may include, but are not limited to, flight crews, instructors, armorers, central alarm system operators, crisis negotiators, investigators, canine handlers, and law enforcement specialists. The assignment of such specialists and scope of such duties must be based on site-specific needs and approved by the local ODFSA.

      (i) —(1)  Prior to initial assignment to supervisory duty, each PF supervisor must successfully complete a supervisor training program designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, ability needed to competently perform all essential functions of the job and tasks associated with supervisory job responsibilities. Appropriate annual refresher training must be provided. The essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL and must include the essential functions and task areas identified for the level of PF personnel to be supervised. Armed supervisors of SPOs must be trained and qualified as SPOs. SPO supervisors must meet applicable medical and physical readiness qualification and certification standards for assigned response duties.

      (2)  Each PF supervisor must possess the skills necessary to effectively direct the actions of assigned personnel. Each supervisor must demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the skills and abilities necessary to perform those jobs.

      (j)  Exercises of various types must be included in the training and performance testing process for the purposes of achieving and maintaining skills and assessing individual, leader and collective competency levels. The types and frequency of training exercises must be determined by the training needs analysis conducted as part of the training program, and approved by the local ODFSA. These exercises must be planned and conducted to provide site-specific training to the PF in the prevention of the successful completion of potential adversarial acts as specified by DOE.

      (k)  (1) No person may be authorized to carry a firearm as an SPO until the responsible local ODFSA is assured that the individual who is to be armed with individually issued/primary weapons is qualified in accordance with firearms standards or that, in the case of post-specific crew-served and special weapons, a determination of proficiency and ability to operate the weapon safely has been made.

      (2) As a minimum, each SPO must meet the applicable firearms qualification or proficiency standards every six months under daylight and reduced lighting conditions. Requalification or proficiency demonstration must occur no earlier than 30 days prior to, and no later than 30 days after, six months from the previous qualification. In the case of individually assigned/primary weapons, if the SPO does not re-qualify during the re-qualification period, the individual's authority to be armed and to make arrests must be suspended following the unsuccessful qualification attempts as provided in paragraph (k)(11) of this section. For post-specific and crew-served weapons, if the SPO does not demonstrate proficiency during the re-qualification period, the individual's eligibility for assignment to posts having those post-specific or crew-served weapons must be suspended until such time as proficiency can be demonstrated. To facilitate training programs, employers may adjust qualification and proficiency demonstration schedules as long as the maximum durations as noted in this section are not exceeded.

      (3) PF personnel must maintain firearms proficiency on a continuing basis. Therefore, an SPO may be required to demonstrate an ability to meet the applicable firearms qualification or proficiency standard(s) during a Headquarters or field audit, survey, inspection, or other situation directed by the local ODFSA. Failure to meet the standard must be treated as if the individual failed the first attempt during routine semiannual qualification or proficiency demonstration. See paragraph (k)(10) of this section. In the event the SPO fails both attempts, the requirements of paragraphs (k)(11) through (14) of this section apply.

      (4) Each SPO must qualify with primary/individually-issued weapons required by duty assignment (to include: specialty weapons, long gun and/or handgun, if so armed). Qualification is the semiannual act of achieving a set score while demonstrating the ability to load, operate, and discharge a firearm or weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing the weapon at the conclusion of firing) according to a Departmentally-approved course of fire. At least one of the two semiannual qualifications must be accomplished with the same type of firearm or weapon system and ammunition equivalent in trajectory and recoil as that authorized for duty use. All qualification courses must: be constrained by time, identify the maximum amount of available ammunition, and include minimum scoring percentages required to qualify.

      (5) For the purposes of this part, weapons system simulator means a device that closely simulates all major aspects of employing the corresponding actual firearm/weapons system, without firing live ammunition. The simulator should permit all weapons-handling and operational actions required by the actual weapon, and should allow the use of sight settings similar to the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads. Additionally, when weapons or weapons system simulators are used for qualification testing of protective force officers, the operation of the simulated weapon must closely approximate all weapons handling and operational manipulation actions required by the actual weapon. The simulation system must precisely register on-target hits and misses with accuracy comparable to the actual weapon at the same shooting distances. The weight, balance, and sighting systems should closely replicate those of the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads, and noise signatures and felt recoil should be simulated to the extent technically feasible.

      (6) SPOs assigned to posts which require the operation of post-specific specialized or crew-served weapons must be trained and must demonstrate proficiency in the safe use of such weapons in a tactical environment. These proficiency courses must provide for the demonstration of skills required to support the site security plan. Ammunition equivalent in both trajectory and recoil to that used for duty must be used during an initial demonstration of proficiency. A weapons proficiency demonstration means a process based on a predetermined, objective set of criteria approved by the respective program office in consultation with EHSS-1 that results in a grade (e.g., pass/fail). The process must ensure that an individual (or team, for crew-served weapons) demonstrates the ability to perform all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing/returning to safe mode the weapon system at the conclusion of firing), without the necessity for scoring targets during the course of fire. Proficiency courses of fire must include tactically-relevant time constraints. Demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the actual weapon and assigned duty load, with alternate loads (e.g., frangible or dye-marking rounds), or with authorized weapons system simulators, as defined in this section. Proficiency courses of fire must be tactically relevant.

      (7) Weapon system simulators may be used for training, familiarization, and semiannual proficiency verifications (e.g., engaging moving vehicles and/or aircraft). Demonstrations of proficiency must include all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing the weapon at the conclusion of firing) according to a Departmentally-approved course of proficiency demonstration. Weapon demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the same type of firearm or weapon system and ammunition equivalent in trajectory and recoil as that authorized for duty use, or with firearms simulators that have the features and capabilities as described in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.

      (8) Each SPO must be given a presentation on the basic principles of weapons safety prior to any range activity. This does not require that a weapons safety presentation be given for each course of fire, but does require that, prior to the start of range training or qualification for a given period (e.g., initial qualification, semiannual qualification, training, familiarization, proficiency testing, or range practice), each SPO must be given a range and weapon safety presentation.

      (9) Standardized Departmentally-approved firearm/weapon qualification courses must be used for qualification. Site-specific conditions and deployment of specialized firearms/weapons may justify requirements for developing and implementing supplementary special training and proficiency courses. Proficiency courses or demonstrations must be constrained by time limits. Where standardized Department firearms/weapons courses do not exist for a weapons system that is required to address site-specific concerns, both daylight and reduced lighting site-specific qualification or proficiency courses (as applicable) must be developed. After approval by the local ODFSA, the developed courses must be submitted to the respective program office for review and approval.

      (10) When qualification or demonstration of proficiency is prescribed, SPOs must be allowed two attempts to qualify with assigned firearms/weapons semiannually. A designated firearms instructor or other person in charge of the range must ensure the shooter understands that the attempt will be for qualification. Once this has been communicated by the firearms instructor or person in charge, the attempt must constitute an attempt to qualify or demonstrate proficiency. The SPO must qualify or demonstrate proficiency during one of these attempts.

      (11) Upon suspension of an SPO's authority to carry firearms, in order to return to status, the SPO must enter a standardized, remedial firearms/weapons training program developed by the respective site PF contractor firearms training staff. The remedial training program must be a combination of basic weapon manipulation skills, firearms safety, and an additional segment of time individually designed to provide the SPO with the necessary individual training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the firearms/weapons qualification or proficiency standards by addressing specific areas of performance.

      (12) When qualification is required following the completion of the remedial training course, any SPO who fails to qualify after two subsequent attempts must lose SPO status and the authority to carry firearms/weapons and to make arrests. When weapons-specific safety or proficiency cannot be demonstrated, the SPO must not be assigned to posts that require the operation of that weapon until such safety or proficiency standards can be met.

      (13) Any SPO who requires remedial training on three consecutive semiannual qualification periods with the same type of firearm/weapon (caliber, make, and model, but not necessarily the exact same weapon) must be removed from duties that require the issuance of that weapon. If the weapon is considered a primary duty weapon; e.g., rifle or handgun, the officer must be removed from SPO status based on recurring inability to maintain qualification status. If an SPO requires remedial training for the same firearm during three consecutive semiannual qualification periods, then a fourth remediation shall not be offered for subsequent failures to achieve that firearms qualification standard. The employer may reinstate an individual removed from SPO status if the individual can demonstrate the ability to pass the current Department qualification course for that firearm. Prior to being given the opportunity to obtain reinstatement, the SPO must provide the employer written validation from a certified firearms instructor that the SPO has demonstrated the ability to meet applicable DOE standards. All such training and validation expenses are solely the responsibility of the SPO. If reinstatement under these circumstances occurs, the employer must provide all other training for returning protective force members according to the requirements of this part and as otherwise specified by DOE.

      (14) An appropriate Department record must be maintained for each SPO who qualifies or who attempts to qualify or to demonstrate proficiency. Records must be retained for one year after separation of a PF member from SPO duties, unless a longer retention period is specified by other requirements. A supervisor or a training officer must be designated, in writing, as the individual authorized to certify the validity of the scores.

      § 1046.18   Access authorization.

#### § § 1046.18

      PF personnel must have the access authorization for the highest level of classified matter to which they have access or SNM which they protect. The specific level of access authorization required for each duty assignment must be determined by the site security organization and approved by the local ODFSA. At sites where access authorizations are not required, SPOs must have at least a background investigation based upon a national agency check with local agency and credit check with maximum duration between reinvestigations not to exceed 10 years. This background investigation must be favorably adjudicated by the applicable Departmental field element. Those SPOs who have access to Category I or Category II quantities of SNM as defined by DOE or with access to credible roll-up potential to Category I according to site-specific determination must have and maintain a DOE “Q” access authorization.

      § 1046.19   Medical and fitness for duty status reporting requirements.

#### § § 1046.19

      (a) SPOs and SOs must report immediately to their supervisor that they have a known or suspected change in health status that might impair their capacity for duty. To protect their medical confidentiality, they are required only to identify that they need to see the Designated Physician. SOs and SPOs must provide to the Designated Physician detailed information on any known or suspected change in health status that might impair their capacity for duty or the safe and effective performance of assigned duties.

      (b) SPOs and SOs must report to their supervisor and the Designated Physician for a determination of fitness for duty when prescription medication is started or a dosage is changed, to ensure that such medication or change in dosage does not alter the individual's ability to perform any of the essential functions of the job. SPOs and SOs must report to their supervisor and the Designated Physician for a determination of fitness for duty within 24 hours, and prior to assuming duty, after any medication capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior is started, to ensure that such medication does not alter the individual's ability to perform any of the essential functions of the job. Where a written reasonable accommodation determination already has been made, any additional change to an SO's or SPO's health status affecting that accommodation must be reported to their supervisor and the Designated Physician for a determination of fitness for duty.

      (c) Supervisory personnel must document and report to the Designated Physician any observed physical, behavioral, or health changes or deterioration in work performance in SPOs and SOs under their supervision.

      (d)(1) PF contractor management must inform the Designated Physician of all anticipated job transfers or recategorizations including:

      (i) From SO to FPRS, BRS, ARS, or SRT Member;

      (ii) From FPRS, to BRS, ARS or SRT Member;

      (iii) From BRS to ARS or SRT Member;

      (iv) From ARS to SRT Member;

      (v) From SRT Member to ARS, BRS, FPRS or SO;

      (vi) From ARS to BRS, FPRS, or SO;

      (vii) From BRS to FPRS or SO;

      (viii) From FPRS to SO; and

> [50 FR 30929, July 31, 1985, as amended at 80 FR 23692, Apr. 29, 2015]

      § 1047.5   Exercise of arrest authority—general guidelines.

#### § § 1047.5

      (a) In making an arrest, the protective force officer should announce his or her authority (e.g., “Security Officer”) and that the person is under arrest prior to taking the person into custody. If the circumstances are such that making such announcements would be useless or dangerous to the officer or others, the protective force officer may dispense with these announcements.

      (b) The protective force officer at the time and place of arrest may search any arrested person for weapons and criminal evidence and the area into which the arrested person might reach for a weapon or to destroy evidence. Guidance on the proper conduct and limitations in scope of search and seizure of evidence shall be obtained from the local DOE Office of Chief Counsel, in coordination with contractor legal counsel, as appropriate.

      (c) After the arrest is effected, the arrested person shall be advised of his or her constitutional right against self-incrimination (Miranda warnings). If the circumstances are such that making such advisement is dangerous to the officer or others, this requirement may be postponed until the immediate danger has passed.

      (d) Custody of the person arrested should be transferred to other federal law enforcement personnel (i.e., U.S. Marshals or FBI agents) or to LLEA personnel, as appropriate, as soon as practicable. The arrested person should not be questioned or required to sign written statements unless:

      (1) Questioning is necessary for security or safety reasons (e.g., questioning to locate a bomb), or

      (2) Questioning is authorized by other federal law enforcement personnel or LLEA officers responsible for investigating the crime.

      § 1047.6   Use of physical force when making an arrest.

#### § § 1047.6

      (a) When a protective force officer has the right to make an arrest as discussed above, the protective force officer may use only that physical force which is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest the offender; to prevent the escape of the offender; or to defend himself or herself or a third person from what the protective force officer believes to be the use or threat of imminent use of physical force by the offender. It should be noted that verbal abuse alone by the offender cannot be the basis under any circumstances for use of physical force by a protective force officer.

      (b) Protective force officers shall consult the local DOE Office of Chief Counsel and contractor legal counsel, as appropriate, for additional guidance on use of physical force in making arrests.

      § 1047.7   Use of deadly force.

#### § § 1047.7

      (a) Deadly force means that force which a reasonable person would consider likely to cause death or serious bodily harm. Its use may be justified only under conditions of extreme necessity, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed. A protective force officer is authorized to use deadly force only when one or more of the following circumstances exists:

      (1)  When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to protect a protective force officer who reasonably believes himself or herself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.

      (2)  When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offense against a person(s) in circumstances presenting an imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm (e.g. sabotage of an occupied facility by explosives).

      (3)  When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the theft, sabotage, or unauthorized control of a nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive device.

      (4)  When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the theft, sabotage, or unauthorized control of special nuclear material from an area of a fixed site or from a shipment where Category II or greater quantities are known or reasonably believed to be present.

      (5)  When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to apprehend or prevent the escape of a person reasonably believed to: (i) have committed an offense of the nature specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4)   of this section; or (ii) be escaping by use of a weapon or explosive or who otherwise indicates that he or she poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the protective force officer or others unless apprehended without delay.

      (b)  If it becomes necessary to use a firearm, the following precautions shall be observed:

      (1) A warning, e.g. an order to halt, shall be given, if feasible, before a shot is fired.

      (2) Warning shots shall not be fired.

    (b) A Protective Force Officer is authorized to make an arrest for a felony committed in violation of laws of the United States, or for a misdemeanor committed in violation of laws of the United States if the offense is committed in the officer's presence.

    (c) A Protective Force Officer also is authorized to make an arrest for a felony committed in violation of laws of the United States if the Officer has reasonably grounds to believe that the felony has been committed, or that the suspect is committing the felony, and is in the immediate area of the felony or is fleeing the immediate area of the felony. “Reasonable grounds to believe” means that the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the Protective Force Officer at the moment of arrest, and of which the Protective Force Officer has reasonably trustworthy information, would be sufficient to cause a prudent person to believe that the suspect had committed or was committing a felony.

    § 1049.5   Exercise of arrest authority—General guidelines.

#### § § 1049.5

    (a) In making an arrest, and before taking a person into custody, the Protective Force Officer should:

    (1) Announce the Protective Force Officer's authority ( by identifying himself as an SPR Protective Force Officer);

    (2) State that the suspect is under arrest; and

    (3) Inform the suspect of the crime for which the suspect is being arrested. If the circumstances are such that making these announcements would be useless or dangerous to the Officer or to another person, the Protective Force Officer may dispense with these announcements.

    (b) At the time and place of arrest, the Protective Force Officer may search the person arrested for weapons and criminal evidence, and may search the area into which the person arrested might reach to obtain a weapon to destroy evidence.

    (c) After the arrest is effected, the person arrested shall be advised of his constitutional right against self-incrimination (“ warnings”). If the circumstances are such that immediately advising the person arrested of this right would result in imminent danger to the Officer or other persons, the Protective Force Officer may postpone this requirement. The person arrested shall be advised of this right as soon as practicable after the imminent danger has passed.

    (d) As soon as practicable after the arrest is effected, custody of the person arrested should be transferred to other Federal law enforcement personnel ( U.S. Marshals or FBI agents) or to local law enforcement personnel, as appropriate, in order to ensure that the person is brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.

    (e) Ordinarily, the person arrested shall not be questioned or required to sign written statements unless such questioning is:

    (1) Necessary to establish the identity of the person arrested and the purpose for which such person is within or upon the SPR;

    (2) Necessary to avert an immediate threat to security or safety ( to locate a bomb); or

    (3) Authorized by other Federal law enforcement personnel or local law enforcement personnel responsible for investigating the alleged crime.

    § 1049.6   Exercise of arrest authority—Use of non-deadly force.

#### § § 1049.6

    (a) When a Protective Force Officer is authorized to make an arrest as provided in the Act, the Protective Force Officer may use only that degree of non-deadly force that is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest the suspect in order to prevent escape or to defend the Protective Force Officer or other persons from what the Officer reasonably believes to be the use or threat of imminent use of non-deadly force by the suspect. Verbal abuse by the suspect, in itself, is not a basis for the use of non-deadly force by a Protective Force Officer under any circumstances.

    (b) Protective Force Officers should consult the local DOE Office of Chief Counsel and contractor legal counsel for additional guidance on the use of non-deadly force in the exercise of arrest authority, as appropriate.

    § 1049.7   Exercise of arrest authority—Use of deadly force.

#### § § 1049.7

    (a) The use of deadly force is authorized only under exigent circumstances where the Protective Force Officer reasonably believes that such force is necessary to:

    (1) Protect himself from an imminent threat of death or from serious bodily harm;

    (2) Protect any person or persons in or upon the SPR from an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.

    (b) If circumstances require the use of a firearm by a Protective Force Officer, the Officer shall give a verbal warning ( an order to halt), if feasible. A Protective Force Officer shall not fire warning shots under any circumstances.

    § 1049.8   Training of SPR Protective Force Officers and qualification to carry firearms.

#### § § 1049.8

    (a) Protective Force Officers shall successfully complete training required by applicable Department of Energy orders prior to receiving authorization to carry firearms. The Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer shall approve the course.

    (6) Use of vehicles, including vehicle safety in routine and emergency situations;

    (7) Safety, first aid, and elementary firefighting procedures;

    (8) Operating in such a manner as to preserve SPR sites and facilities;

    (9) Communications, including methods and procedures.

    (c) After completing training, and receiving the appropriate security clearance, Protective Force Officers shall be authorized to carry firearms and exercise limited arrest authority.

    (e) Protective Force Officers shall be qualified in the use of firearms by demonstrating proficiency in the use of firearms on a semiannual basis prior to receiving authorization to carry firearms. Protective Force Officers shall demonstrate proficiency in the use of all types of weapons expected to be used while on duty under both day and night conditions. In demonstrating firearms proficiency, Protective Force Officers shall use firearms of the same type and barrel length as firearms used by Protective Force Officers while on duty, and the same type of ammunition as that used by Protective Force Officers on duty. Before a Protective Force Officer is qualified in the use of firearms, the Officer shall complete a review of the basic principles of firearms safety.

    (f) Protective Force Officers shall be allowed two attempts to qualify in the use of firearms. Protective Force Officers shall qualify in the use of firearms within six months of failing to qualify. If an Officer fails to qualify, the Officer shall complete a remedial firearms training program. A Protective Force Officer who fails to qualify in the use of firearms after completion of a remedial program, and after two further attempts to qualify shall not be authorized to carry firearms or to exercise limited arrest authority.

      (d) The Inspector General shall investigate suspected violations of these regulations pursuant to § 1050.303 below.

    Subpart B—Guidelines for Acceptance of Foreign Gifts or Decorations

      § 1050.201   Policy against accepting foreign gifts or decorations.

#### § § 1050.201

      (a) The Constitution of the United States, Article I, section 9, clause 8, provides that “* * * no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under * * * [the United States], shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any * * * foreign State.” In the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act the Congress consented to the acceptance by Federal employees of gifts and decorations with certain constraints and under certain procedures. Acceptance of any gift or decoration not consistent with this Act, the Department of Energy Organization Act, or the regulations in this part is prohibited.

      (b) No employee shall request or otherwise encourage the tender of a gift or decoration from a foreign government. No employee shall accept a gift or decoration from a foreign government except as provided in §§ 1050.202 or 1050.203 of this part and in accordance with the additional procedures set forth in §§ 1050.204 and 1050.301 of this part.

      § 1050.202   Allowable acceptance of gifts.

#### § § 1050.202

      (a) An employee may accept and retain gifts from foreign governments where the gift is tendered or received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, and is of minimal value. Initial responsibility for determining the value of a gift lies with the employee.

      (b) Subject to the prior approval requirements described in § 1050.204(a) of this part, an employee may accept gifts of more than minimal value, tendered as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, where it appears that refusal of the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. Otherwise, an employee, when offered a gift of more than minimal value from a foreign government, other than a gift designated in paragraph (c) of this section, should advise the donor that acceptance of such gifts by the employee is contrary to the policy of the United States. If a gift described in this paragraph is accepted by an employee and not immediately returned thereby, it shall be deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States. Upon acceptance it becomes the property of the United States. Within 60 days after acceptance by the employee, the gift shall be deposited with the Directorate of Administration for disposal or official Departmental use as determined by the Directorate of Administration, in accordance with § 1050.302 of this part, and an appropriate statement shall be filed by the employee in accordance with § 1050.301(a) of this part.

      (c) Subject to the prior approval requirements described in § 1050.204(a) of this part, an employee may accept and retain gifts of more than minimal value:

      (1) Where the gift is in the nature of an educational scholarship.

      (2) Where the gift is in the form of medical treatment.

      (d) An employee may accept gifts (whether or not of minimal value) of travel or expenses for travel (such as transportation, food, lodging, or entertainment) taking place entirely outside of the United States where the provision of such travel or expenses is in accordance with diplomatic custom or treaty and where the Head of the employee's Office grants prior written approval. A spouse or dependent may accept gifts of travel or travel expenses when accompanying the employee, provided this is done with the prior written approval of the Head of the employee's Office. The Head of the employee's Office shall consult with the appropriate General Counsel in connection with granting approval under this paragraph. Travel or expenses for travel may not be accepted merely for the personal benefit, pleasure, enjoyment, or financial enrichment of the individual involved. An appropriate statement shall be filed in accordance with § 1050.301(b) of this part. When  of the travel (such as the origination or termination of a flight) is within the United States, it may not be paid for by a foreign government, except as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (e) Pursuant to section 652 of the DOE Organization Act, an employee may accept gifts from the International Atomic Energy Agency or other energy-related international organizations (e.g., the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency) covering transportation expenses to or from a foreign country in connection with scientific or technical assistance projects of such agencies for which the Department of Energy has lead U.S. Government agency responsibility. Such gifts may be accepted only with the prior written approval of the Head of the employee's Office, who is hereby delegated authority to accept such gifts in accordance with section 652.

      § 1050.203   Acceptance of decorations.

#### § § 1050.203

      (a) An employee may accept, retain and wear a decoration tendered by a foreign government in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.

      (b) Acceptance of a decoration in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be reviewed and approved by the Directorate of Administration in accordance with § 1050.204 of this part. Otherwise, it will be deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States, shall become the property of the United States, and shall be deposited, within 60 days of acceptance, with the Directorate of Administration for disposal or official Departmental use as determined by the Directorate of Administration in accordance with § 1050.302 of this part.

      § 1050.204   Advance approval for acceptance of gifts or decorations.

#### § § 1050.204

      (a) If an employee is advised that a gift of more than minimal value as described in § 1050.202 (b) or (c) is to be tendered to him or her, the employee shall, if time permits, request the written advice of the Directorate of Administration regarding the appropriateness of accepting or refusing the gift. A request for approval shall be submitted to the Directorate of Administration in writing, stating the nature of the gift and the reasons for which it is being tendered. The Directorate of Administration shall consult with Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and the appropriate General Counsel in connection with advising the employee. If such advice cannot be obtained and refusal of the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely effect the foreign relations of the United States, the gift may be accepted, but the Directorate of Administration shall be informed as soon as possible. In either event, the employee shall proceed as provided in §§ 1050.202 and 1050.301 of this part.

      (b) Where an employee is notified of the intent of a foreign government to award him a decoration for outstanding or unusually meritorious service, approval required under § 1050.203 should be obtained prior to acceptance of the award. A request for approval shall be submitted to the Directorate of Administration in writing, stating the nature of the decoration and the reasons for which it is being awarded. The Directorate of Administration shall consult with the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and the appropriate General Counsel. If time does not permit the employee to obtain approval for the award of the decoration before its receipt, the employee may accept it, but shall seek such approval immediately thereafter.

    Subpart C—Procedures and Enforcement

      § 1050.301   Reports.

#### § § 1050.301

      (a) Within 60 days of accepting a gift of more than minimal value, other than gifts of travel or travel expenses, which are covered in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee shall, in addition to depositing a tangible gift (e.g. wearing apparel, liquor, etc.) with the Directorate of Administration in accordance with § 1050.202 of this part, file with the Directorate of Administration a statement concerning the gift containing the information identified on the sample form set forth in appendix I. The form set forth in appendix I must also be filed if the aggregate value of gifts accepted by the recipient from all sources over any period of one year exceeds $250.

      (b) Within 30 days after accepting travel or travel expenses in accordance with § 1050.202 of this part, an employee shall file with the Directorate of Administration a statement concerning the travel containing the information identified on the sample form set forth in appendix II. Such a statement need not be filed, however, if the travel is in accordance with specific travel arrangements made by the Department in cooperation with the foreign government.

      (c) The Directorate of Administration shall:

      (1) Maintain the statements filed pursuant to these regulations and make them available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours; and

      (2) Not later than January 31 of each year compile and transmit to the Department of State for publication by the Department of State in the  a list of all statements filed pursuant to these regulations during the preceding calendar year.

      § 1050.302   Use or disposal of gifts and decorations accepted on behalf of the United States.

#### § § 1050.302

      (a) The Directorate of Administration shall accept and maintain custody of all tangible gifts and decorations accepted by employees on behalf of the United States pending their final disposition.

      (b) Whenever possible, the gift or decoration shall be returned to the original donor. The Directorate of Administration shall examine the circumstances surrounding its donation, and, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, assess whether any adverse effect upon the United States foreign relations might result from return of the gift or decoration to the donor. The appropriate officials of the Department of State shall be consulted if the question of an adverse effect arises.

      (c) The Directorate of Administration may determine that the gift or decoration may be retained for the official use of the Department, if it can be properly displayed in an area at Headquarters or at a field facility accessible to employees or members of the public or if it is otherwise usable in carrying out the mission of the Department. The Assistant Secretary for International Affairs shall be consulted to determine whether failure to accept the gift or decoration for the official use of the Department will have an adverse effect on the foreign relations of the United States. In no case shall a gift or decoration be accepted for the official use of the Department when the enjoyment and beneficial use of the gift will accrue primarily to the benefit of the donee or any other individual employee. Gifts or decorations that are retained for the official use of the Department shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section when their official use is ended.

      (d) If a gift or decoration is not retained for official use of the Department, or if its official use has ended, the Directorate of Administration shall, within 30 days after its deposit or after its official use has ended—

      (1) Report the gift or decoration to the General Services Administration (GSA) for transfer, donation, or other disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Federal Property Management Regulations at 41 CFR part 101-49, or

      (2) If the gift or decoration is in cash, currency, or monies (except those with possible historic or numismatic value), or is a noncash monetary gift such as a check, money order, bonds, shares of stock, or other negotiable instrument, forward it to the Finance and Accounting Office for deposit with the Department of the Treasury.

      (e) The Directorate of Administration shall retain custody of gifts and decorations not returned to the donor or retained for the official use of the Department until GSA directs it concerning their disposition. At the request of GSA, the Directorate of Administration shall arrange for appraisal of specific gifts and decorations.

      § 1050.303   Enforcement.

#### § § 1050.303

      (a) An employee who violates the provisions of the Act or these regulations may be subject to disciplinary action or civil penalty action as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

      (b) Suspected violations of the Act or these regulations shall be reported promptly to the appropriate General Counsel and the Inspector General.

      (c) The Inspector General will be responsible for taking the following actions:

      (1) If the results of an investigation by the Inspector General do not provide any support for a determination that a violation of the Act or these regulations has occurred, then no further action shall be taken.

      (2) If it is determined that the employee knowingly and through actions within his own control has done any of the following, the matter shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action:

      (i) Solicited or accepted a gift from a foreign government in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and these regulations;

      (ii) As the approved recipient of travel expenses failed to follow the procedures set forth in the Act and these regulations; or

      (iii) Failed to deposit or report a gift as required by the Act and these regulations.

      (d) As set forth in section 7342(h) of title 5, United States Code, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any district court of the United States against any employee who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government not consented to by the Act, or who fails to deposit or report such gift as required by the Act. The court in which such action is brought may assess a civil penalty against such employee in any amount not to exceed the retail value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus $25,622.
