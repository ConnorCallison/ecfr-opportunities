Unless your lease lies offshore of Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief.

Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to modification when directed by the District Manager.\n",

The District Manager may also restrict the use of components that could cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud system without prior approval of the District Manager. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all petroleum-based mud to prevent its discharge into the marine environment.

                      "(4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or repaired.\n",

You must calculate the number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;\n",

The pressures posted must consider the surface pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must post the following two pressures:\n",

Your tests must conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and for kick detection.

The dual bore riser must meet the design requirements of API RP 2RD (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), including appropriate design for the maximum anticipated operating and environmental conditions.\n",

On the kill line, you may install a check valve and a manual valve instead of the remote-controlled valve. To use this configuration, both manual valves must be readily accessible and you must install the check valve between the manual valves and the pump.\n",

                          "(1) BOP system components must be in the following order from the top down:\n",
                          "(2) You may use a set of hydraulically-operated combination rams for the blind rams and shear rams.\n",
                          "(3) You may use a set of hydraulically-operated combination rams for the hydraulic two-way slip rams and the hydraulically-operated pipe rams.\n",
                          "(4) You must attach a dual check valve assembly to the coiled tubing connector at the downhole end of the coiled tubing string for all coiled tubing operations. If you plan to conduct operations without downhole check valves, you must describe alternate procedures and equipment in Form BSEE-0124, Application for Permit to Modify and have it approved by the District Manager.\n",
                          "(5) You must have a kill line and a separate choke line. You must equip each line with two full-opening valves and at least one of the valves must be remotely controlled. You may use a manual valve instead of the remotely controlled valve on the kill line if you install a check valve between the two full-opening manual valves and the pump or manifold. The valves must have a working pressure rating equal to or greater than the working pressure rating of the connection to which they are attached, and you must install them between the well control stack and the choke or kill line. For operations with expected surface pressures greater than 3,500 psi, the kill line must be connected to a pump or manifold. You must not use the kill line inlet on the BOP stack for taking fluid returns from the wellbore.\n",
                          "(6) You must have a hydraulic-actuating system that provides sufficient accumulator capacity to close-open-close each component in the BOP stack. This cycle must be completed with at least 200 psi above the pre-charge pressure, without assistance from a charging system.\n",
                          "(7) All connections used in the surface BOP system from the tree to the uppermost required ram must be flanged, including the connections between the well control stack and the first full-opening valve on the choke line and the kill line.\n",
                          "(b) BSEE considers all coiled tubing operations to be non-routine.\n"

You must install a fixed water spray system in enclosed well-bay areas where hydrocarbon vapors may accumulate. Your firewater system must conform to the USCG requirements for firefighting systems on floating facilities.\n",

In doing this, you must consider the specific environmental conditions at the platform location.\n",

                          "(c) Under emergency conditions, you may make repairs to primary structural elements to restore an existing permitted condition without submitting an application or receiving prior BSEE approval for up to 120-calendar days following an event. You must notify the Regional Supervisor of the damage that occurred within 24 hours of its discovery, and you must provide a written completion report to the Regional Supervisor of the repairs that were made within 1 week after completing the repairs. If you make emergency repairs on a floating platform, you must also notify the USCG.\n",
                          "(d) You must determine if your new platform or major modification to an existing platform is subject to the Platform Verification Program (PVP). Section 250.910 of this subpart fully describes the facilities that are subject to the PVP. If you determine that your platform is subject to the PVP, you must follow the requirements of §§ 250.909 through 250.918 of this subpart.\n",

If BSEE cancels the approval, you must resubmit your platform application and receive BSEE approval if you still plan to install the platform.\n",
                          "(2) For platforms subject to the PVP, cancellation of an approval will be on an individual platform basis. For these platforms, BSEE will identify the date when the installation approval will be cancelled (if installation has not occurred) during the application and approval process. If BSEE cancels your installation approval, you must resubmit your platform application and receive BSEE approval if you still plan to install the platform.\n\n\n"
