      Subpart 808.4—Federal Supply Schedules

        808.402   General.

#### § 808.402

        (a) GSA has delegated authority to the VA to procure medical equipment, supplies, services and pharmaceuticals under the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program. The VA FSS program includes medical supplies in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Groups 65 and 66 and services in FSC 621 for Professional and Allied Healthcare Staffing Services and Medical Laboratory Testing and Analysis Services.

        808.404   Use of Federal Supply Schedules.

#### § 808.404

        808.404-70   Use of Federal Supply Schedules—the Veterans First Contracting Program.

#### § 808.404-70

        (a) The Veterans First Contracting Program, implemented in subpart 819.70 pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127-8128, applies to BPAs, and orders under FAR subpart 8.4 and has precedence over other small business programs.

        (b) Contracting officers, when establishing a BPA or placing an order against the FSS, shall ensure that priorities for veteran-owned small businesses are implemented within the VA hierarchy of small business program preferences in subpart 819.70. Specifically, the contracting officer will consider preferences for verified SDVOSBs first, then preferences for verified VOSBs. These priorities will be followed by preferences for other small businesses in accordance with 819.7005.

        (c) If unable to satisfy requirements for supplies and services from the mandatory sources in 808.002 and 808.004-70, contracting officers may consider commercial sources in the open market (see FAR 8.004(b)) if an open market acquisition is most appropriate (see FAR 8.004) and a VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) determination is made (see subpart 819.70).

        (d) When the servicing agency will award contracts under an interagency agreement on behalf of the VA, the contracting officer shall ensure the interagency acquisition complies with FAR subpart 17.5 and subpart 817.5 and includes terms requiring compliance with the VA Rule of Two (see 817.501).

        808.405   Ordering procedures for Federal Supply Schedules.

#### § 808.405

        808.405-70   Set-aside procedures for VA and GSA Federal Supply Schedules.

#### § 808.405-70

        To satisfy VA legislative requirements, contracting officers shall use the supplemental ordering procedures of this section when establishing a BPA or placing an order for supplies or services under this subpart as follows:

        (a)  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127, contracting activities shall set-aside BPAs and orders for VIP-listed SDVOSBs or VOSBs when, based on research, the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans or owned and controlled by Veterans with service-connected disabilities will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. When the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) is met:

        (1) The set-aside requirements as provided in 819.7006 and 819.7007 are mandatory.

        (2) The requirements in FAR 8.405-1, 8.405-2, and 8.405-3 apply, except only quotes received from verified ( VIP-listed) and eligible SDVOSBs or VOSBs will be considered.

        (3) The eligibility requirements of 819.7003, 819.7006, and 819.7007 apply, including the requirement for offerors to be VIP-listed at the time they submit offers/quotes as well as at the time awards are made.

        (4) The contracting officer shall notify potential offerors of the unique VA verification requirements by including in the solicitation the applicable set-aside clause prescribed at 819.7011.

        (b)  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128 and to the extent that market research does not support an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside in either FSS or the open market, the contracting activity shall give priority in the award of orders placed under this part to VIP-listed SDVOSBs/VOSBs through the use of evaluation preferences giving priority to SDVOSBs first, then to a lesser extent VOSBs, and finally to any firm that proposes to use SDVOSBs/VOSBs as subcontractors. Contracting officers must use the clause prescribed in 808.405-570(b).

        (c)  The SDVOSB and VOSB eligibility requirements in 819.7003 apply, including current SDVOSB and VOSB VIP-listed status at the time of submission of offer/quote and at time of award. The offeror must also represent that it meets the small business size standard for the assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code as well as other small business requirements (including completing the certification found in 852.219-75 or 852.219-76.

        808.405-570   Small business set-asides and preferences—Veterans First Contracting Program clauses.

#### § 808.405-570

        (a) When setting aside an order pursuant to 808.405-70(a), the applicable clause prescribed in 819.7011 for SDVOSB/VOSB set-asides shall be used.

        (b) When an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside is not feasible, the ordering activity shall use the clause at 852.208-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors—Orders or BPAs, for task orders, delivery orders, or BPAs using evaluation factors other than price alone.

        (c) The ordering activity shall insert the clause at 852.208-71, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factor Commitments—Orders or BPAs, in request for quotes and resulting orders that include clause 852.208-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors—Orders or BPAs.

        808.470   Ordering Officers.

#### § 808.470

        In accordance with 801.601, when authorized, ordering officers may place orders for supplies and services against agreements or task or delivery orders established by a contracting officer against Federal Supply Schedules within the ordering limits identified in the contract or agreement or the specific ordering guide when funding is available. Ordering officers shall only place orders against the order or agreement if it is awarded to a single awardee. The contracting officer that awarded the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or order will provide the contractor a list of authorized ordering officers. Any modifications to the agreement or order must be performed by a contracting officer.

#### § 808.001

      808.001-70   Definitions.

#### § 808.001-70

VA FSS contracts include medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary equipment and supplies in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group 65, instruments and laboratory equipment in FSC Group 66 and health care services in FSC Group 621.

      808.002   Priorities for use of mandatory Government sources.

#### § 808.002

      (a)  Contracting activities shall satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the mandatory sources listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section in descending order of priority:

      (1)  (i) VA inventories including the VA supply stock program (41 CFR 101-26.704) and VA excess.

      (ii) Excess from other agencies (see FAR subpart 8.1).

      (iii) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (see 808.603). Prior to considering award of a contract to Federal Prison Industries, Inc., contracting officers shall apply the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) to determine whether a requirement should be awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127-28, by using the preferences and priorities in subpart 819.70. If an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB)/veteran-owned small business (VOSB) as provided in subpart 819.70, FPI remains a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002.

      (iv) Supplies that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, through the AbilityOne Program (FAR subpart 8.7). Supplies that are on the Procurement List but which do not meet the definition of a covered product in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section are only required to be procured from a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002 if an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB after following the procedures set forth in subpart 819.70.

      (A)  As used in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv),  means a product that—

      () Is included on the Procurement List as authorized under 4_1_ U.S.C. 8503(a) (see FAR 8.703) and was included on the Procurement List on or before December 22, 2006; or

      () Meets the following criteria—

      () Is a replacement for a product under th_i_s paragraph (a)(1)(iv);

      () Is essentially the same and meeting the same requirement as the product being replaced; and

      () The contracting officer determines the product meets the quality standards and delivery schedule requirements of VA.

      (B)  Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(C) and (D) of this section, contracting officers shall procure covered products that are on the Procurement List through the AbilityOne Program as set forth in FAR subpart 8.7. Contracting officers shall not procure products that are on the Procurement List, but which do not meet the definition of a covered product using the procedures set forth in FAR subpart 8.7, unless award cannot be made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart 819.70.

      (C)  If a contract for a covered product awarded under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127(d)(1) to a VIP-listed SDVOSB or VOSB was in effect as of August 7, 2020, the requirement shall continue as an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside in accordance with 819.7006 and 819.7007.

      (D)  When a contract previously awarded as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(C) of this section is terminated or expires, contracting officers shall procure such covered product through the AbilityOne Program as a priority mandatory Government source (see paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B) of this section), provided the head of the contracting activity or designee determines there is no reasonable expectation that—

      () Two or more SDVOSBs/VOSBs will submit offers; and

      () Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

      (v) Wholesale supply sources, such as stock programs of the General Services Administration (GSA) (see 41 CFR 101-26.3), the Defense Logistics Agency (see 41 CFR 101-26.6), the Department of Veterans Affairs (see 41 CFR 101-26.704), and military inventory control points.

      (2)  Services that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, through the AbilityOne Program (FAR subpart 8.7). For services that are on the Procurement List, but which do not meet the definition of a covered service in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are only required to be procured from a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002 if an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB after following the procedures set forth in subpart 819.70.

      (i)  As used in this paragraph (a)(2)—

      means a service that—

      () Is included on the Procurement List as authorized under 4_1_ U.S.C. 8503(a) (see FAR 8.703) and was included on the Procurement List on or before December 22, 2006; or

      () Meets the following criteria—

      () Is a replacement for a serv_i_ce under this paragraph (a)(2);

      () Is essentially the same and meeting the same requirement as the service being replaced; and

      () The contracting officer determines the service meets the quality standards and delivery schedule requirements of VA.

      (ii)  Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, contracting officers shall procure covered services that are on the Procurement List through the AbilityOne Program as set forth in FAR subpart 8.7. Contracting officers shall not procure services that are on the Procurement List, but which do not meet the definition of a covered service using the procedures set forth in FAR subpart 8.7, unless award cannot be made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart 819.70.

      (iii)  If a contract for a covered service awarded under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127(d)(1) to a VIP-listed SDVOSB or VOSB was in effect as of August 7, 2020, the requirement shall continue as an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside in accordance with 819.7006 and 819.7007.

      (iv)  When a contract previously awarded as set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section is terminated or expires, contracting officers shall procure such covered service through the AbilityOne Program as a priority mandatory Government source (see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), provided the head of the contracting activity or designee determines there is no reasonable expectation that—

      (A) Two or more SDVOSBs/VOSBs will submit offers; and

      (B) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

      (b)  The contracting officer may use a source other than those listed in paragraph (a) of this section when the need for supplies or services is of an unusual and compelling urgency (see FAR 6.302-2, 8.405-6, and 13.106-1 and part 806 for justification requirements).

      808.004   Use of other sources.

#### § 808.004

      808.004-70   Use of other priority sources.

#### § 808.004-70

      (a)  In order to fulfill the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127-8128 (see subpart 819.70), contracting officers shall award contracts (see FAR 2.101 for the definition of contracts), as well as Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), and orders against VA and GSA Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), providing priority in the awarding of such contracts to VIP-listed SDVOSBs first, then VOSBs.

      (b)  To provide medical supplies in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups 65 and 66 efficiently and effectively the VA, through previous reform initiatives, has implemented key strategic sourcing contract vehicles ( prime-vendor, national contracts, VA FSS). If these strategic sourcing contracts were subject to the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101), they may be determined mandatory by the head of the contracting activity. Contracting officers shall consider these priority contract vehicles before using other existing contract vehicles.

        809.406-3   Procedures.

#### § 809.406-3

        (a) Any individual may submit a referral to debar an individual or contractor to the SDO or to the S&D Committee. The referral for debarment shall be supported with evidence of a cause for debarment listed in FAR 9.406-2, or 809.406-2. The SDO shall forward referrals for debarment to the S&D Committee. If the referring individual is a VA employee and the referral for debarment is based on possible criminal or fraudulent activities, the VA employee shall also refer the matter to the VA Office of Inspector General.

        (b) When the S&D Committee finds preponderance of the evidence for a cause for debarment, as listed in FAR 9.406-2 or 809.406-2, it shall prepare a recommendation and draft notice of proposed debarment for the SDO's consideration.

        (c) VA shall send the notice of proposed debarment to the last known address of the individual or contractor, the individual or contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other means that allows for confirmation of delivery. In the case of a contractor, VA may send the notice of proposed debarment to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The S&D Committee concurrently shall list the appropriate parties as excluded in the SAM in accordance with FAR 9.404.

        (d) If VA does not receive a reply from the contractor within 30 days after sending the notice of proposed debarment, the S&D Committee shall prepare a recommendation and refer the case to the SDO for a decision on whether or not to debar based on the information available.

        (e) If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 30 days after sending the notice of proposed debarment, the S&D Committee shall consider the information in the reply before the S&D Committee makes its recommendation to the SDO.

        (f) The S&D Committee, upon the request of the contractor proposed for debarment, shall, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the S&D Committee to present information or argument personally or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. VA shall conduct the proceeding in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript.

        (g) If the S&D Committee finds the contractor's or individual's submission in opposition to the proposed debarment raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment and the debarment action is not based on a conviction or civil judgment, the S&D Committee shall submit to the SDO the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the SDO agrees there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the SDO shall refer the dispute to a designee for a resolution pursuant to 809.470, Fact-finding procedures. The S&D Committee shall provide the contractor or individual the disputed material fact(s). Decisions and determinations of VA's Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) or Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), such as status protest decisions, and size determinations of the SBA shall not be subject to dispute or fact-finding in proposed debarment actions. The S&D Committee and SDO shall accept these decisions and determinations as resolved facts.

        (h) If the proposed debarment action is based on a conviction or civil judgment, or if there are no disputes over material facts, or if any disputes over material facts have been resolved pursuant to 809.470, Fact-finding procedures, the SDO shall make a decision on the basis of all information available including any written findings of fact submitted by the designated fact finder, and oral or written agreements presented or submitted to the S&D Committee by the contractor.

        (i) In actions processed under FAR 9.406 where no suspension is in place and where fact finding is not required, the VA shall make the final decision on the proposed debarment within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the contractor, unless the SDO extends this period for a good cause.

        (j) In actions processed under 809.406-270(b), the SDO notifies the individuals and/or contractors of the determination of willful and intentional misrepresentation in the notice of proposed debarment. VA shall issue the final decision, removing or upholding the determination, within 90 days after SDO's determination of willful and intentional misrepresentation.

        809.406-4   Period of debarment.

#### § 809.406-4

        (a) The SDO will base the period of debarment on the circumstances surrounding the cause(s) for debarment.

        (b) The SDO may remove a debarment imposed under FAR 9.406, amend its scope, or reduce the period of debarment based on a S&D Committee recommendation if—

        (1) VA has debarred the contractor; and

        (2) The debarring official concurs with documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of the contractor setting forth the appropriate grounds for granting relief. Appropriate grounds include newly discovered material evidence, reversal of a conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management, elimination of the cause for which debarment was imposed, or any other appropriate grounds.

        (c) The period of debarment for willful and intentional misrepresentations of SDVOSB or VOSB status pursuant to 809.406-270(b) shall not be less than 5 years.

#### § 809.407

        809.407-1   General.

#### § 809.407-1

        (a) As provided in FAR 9.407-1(d), authority to determine whether to continue business dealings between VA and a suspended contractor is delegated to the HCAs. Compelling reasons include, but are not limited to, urgency of the need for new or continued work, lengthy time period to acquire the new work from other sources, and meeting estimated quantities for requirements contracts.

        (b) For the purposes of FAR 9.407-1, the SDO is the suspending official under the Federal Management Regulation at 41 CFR 102-117.295.

        809.407-3   Procedures.

#### § 809.407-3

        (a) Any individual may submit a referral to suspend an individual or contractor to the SDO or to the S&D Committee. Referrals shall include supporting evidence of a cause for suspension listed in FAR 9.407-2. The SDO shall forward the referral to the S&D Committee. If the referring individual is a VA employee and the referral for suspension is based on possible criminal or fraudulent activities, the VA employee shall also refer the matter to the VA Office of Inspector General.

        (b) When the S&D Committee finds adequate evidence of a cause for suspension, as listed in FAR 9.407-2, it shall prepare a recommendation and draft notice of suspension for the SDO's consideration.

        (c) VA shall send the notice of suspension to the last known address of the individual or contractor, the individual or contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other means that allows for confirmation of delivery. In the case of a contractor, VA may send the notice of suspension to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The S&D Committee concurrently shall list the appropriate parties as excluded in SAM in accordance with FAR 9.404.

        (d) If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 30 days after receipt of the notice of suspension, the S&D Committee shall consider the information in the reply before the Committee makes further recommendations to the SDO. The S&D Committee, upon the request of a suspended contractor, shall, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the S&D Committee to present information or argument personally or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript.

        (e) For the purposes of FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), Decision making process, in actions not based on an indictment, if the S&D Committee finds that the contractor's submission in opposition to the suspension raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, the S&D Committee shall submit to the SDO the information establishing the dispute of material facts. However, the S&D Committee may first coordinate any further proceeding regarding the material facts in dispute with the Department of Justice or with a State prosecuting authority in a case involving a State jurisdiction. VA shall take no further action to determine disputed material facts pursuant to this section or 809.470 if the Department of Justice or a State prosecuting authority advises VA in writing that additional proceedings to make such a determination would prejudice Federal or State legal proceedings.

        (f) If the SDO agrees that there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the SDO shall refer the dispute to the designee for resolution pursuant to 809.470.

        809.470   Fact-finding procedures.

#### § 809.470

        The provisions of this section constitute the procedures to be used to resolve genuine disputes of material fact pursuant to 809.406-3 and 809.407-3 of this subpart. The SDO shall appoint a designee to conduct the fact-finding. OGC shall represent VA at any fact-finding hearing and may present witnesses for VA and question any witnesses presented by the contractor. The proceedings before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute, as determined by the SDO. The fact-finder shall establish the date for the fact-finding hearing, normally to be held within 30 days after the S&D Committee notifies the contractor or individual that the SDO has established a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists.

        (a) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the material fact(s) identified by the SDO. The contractor or individual may appear in person or through a representative at the fact-finding hearing. The contractor or individual may submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the agency presents.

        (b) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceedings and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.

        (c) The proceedings shall be transcribed and a copy of the transcript shall be made available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the contractor and the fact-finder, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.

        (d) The fact-finder shall determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence for proposed debarments, and by adequate evidence for suspensions. Written findings of fact shall be prepared by the fact-finder. A copy of the findings of fact shall be provided to the SDO, the Government's representative, and the contractor or individual. The SDO will consider the written findings of fact in the decision regarding the suspension or proposed debarment.

Under FAR 9.507-1, the restraint must be appropriate to the nature of the conflict and may exclude the contractor from award of one or more contracts in the future.

        (b) The provision at 852.209-70, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, must be included in any solicitation for the services addressed in FAR 9.502.

#### § 813.003-70

      (a) The Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart 819.70 applies to VA contracts, orders and BPAs under this part and has precedence over other small business programs referenced in FAR parts 13 and 19. For VA policy regarding mandatory Government sources, refer to 808.002.

      (b) Notwithstanding FAR 13.003(b)(2), the contracting officer shall make an award utilizing the priorities for veteran-owned small businesses as implemented within the VA hierarchy of small business program preferences, the Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart 819.70. Specifically, the contracting officer shall consider preferences for verified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) first, then preferences for verified veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs). These priorities will be followed by preferences for other small businesses in accordance with 819.7005.

      (c) When using competitive procedures, the preference for restricting competition to verified SDVOSBs/VOSBs in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section is mandatory whenever market research provides a reasonable expectation of receiving two or more offers/quotes from eligible, capable and verified firms, and that an award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government.

      (1) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127, contracts under this part shall be set-aside for SDVOSBs/VOSBs, in accordance with 819.7006 or 819.7007 when supported by market research. Contracting officers shall use the applicable set-aside clause prescribed at 819.7011.

      (2) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128 and to the extent that market research does not support an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside, the contracting officer shall include evaluation factors as prescribed at 815.304-70 and the evaluation criteria clause prescribed at 815.304-71(a).

      (d) The SDVOSB and VOSB eligibility requirements in 819.7003 apply, including verification of the SDVOSB and VOSB status of an offeror, and other small business requirements in 13 CFR part 121 and 13 CFR 125.6 ( small business representation, nonmanufacturer rule, and subcontracting limitations (see 819.7004 and 819.7011)).

        (b) Except as provided in 815.370-4(a), if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and the solicitation allowed at least 30 days for receipt of proposals (unless the 30-day requirement is not applicable in accordance with 815.370-4(a)(3)), the contracting officer shall—

        (1) Determine through cost or price analysis that the offered price is fair and reasonable and that adequate price competition exists (with approval of the determination at a level above the contracting officer) or another exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data applies (see FAR 15.403-1(c) and 15.403-4).

        (5) Any other type of contract providing for the use of UCAs.

        (b) Insert the applicable information in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of the clause.

        (c) If, at the time of entering into the UCA, the contracting officer knows that the definitive contract action will meet the criteria of FAR 15.403-1, 15.403-2, or 15.403-3 for not requiring submission of certified cost or pricing data, the words “and certified cost or pricing data” may be deleted from paragraph (a) of the clause.

      Subpart 819.2—Policies

        819.201   General policy.

#### § 819.201

        (a) It is VA policy that small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans shall have maximum practicable opportunity to participate in VA acquisitions, consistent the priorities and preferences prescribed under the Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart 819.70.

        (1) To carry out this policy the Secretary shall establish annual SDVOSB and VOSB contracting goals.

        (2) In support of these goals, each administration and staff office shall in turn establish annual goals for each subordinate contracting activity that present, for that activity, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, and particularly SDVOSBs/VOSBs, to participate in the performance of the activity's contracts and subcontracts.

        (3) The attainment of these goals or the use of interagency acquisition vehicles does not limit the applicability of the Veterans First Contracting Program and priorities in subpart 819.70.

        (c) In addition to the duties and responsibilities in FAR 19.201(c), the Executive Director, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), is responsible for overseeing implementation of the Veterans First Contracting Program under subpart 819.70.

        (d) Each organization with contracting authority shall designate small business specialists/technical advisors in coordination with the OSDBU Director.

        819.202   Specific policies.

#### § 819.202

        OSDBU is responsible for reviewing procurement strategies, establishing thresholds for such reviews and making recommendations to assist contracting officers in the implementation of this part. These responsibilities shall be conducted within the VA hierarchy of small business program preferences established by 38 U.S.C. 8127(h) (see subpart 819.70), which requires VA to consider preferences for VIP-listed SDVOSBs first, then preferences for VIP-listed VOSBs. Contracting officers shall use VA Form 2268, Small Business Program and Contract Bundling Review, to document actions and recommendations.

        819.203   Relationship among small business programs.

#### § 819.203

        819.203-70   Priority for SDVOSB/VOSB contracting preferences.

#### § 819.203-70

        (a) 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 require the VA to provide priority and establish special acquisition methods to increase contracting opportunities for SDVOSBs/VOSBs. These priorities and special acquisition methods are set forth in subpart 819.70 and shall be applied by contracting officers before other priorities and preferences in FAR 19.203.

        (b) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128, contracting officers shall give priority to SDVOSBs/VOSBs if such business concern(s) also meet the requirements of that contracting preference. The requirement in this paragraph (b) applies even when using a contracting preference under FAR part 19 (for example, a women-owned small business set-aside).

      Subpart 819.3—Determination of Small Business Size and Status for Small Business Programs

        819.307   Protesting a firm's status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern.

#### § 819.307

        819.307-70   SDVOSB/VOSB status protests.

#### § 819.307-70

        All protests relating to size, status, and/or whether an SDVOSB or a VOSB is a “small business” are subject to the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR part 121 and must be filed in accordance with SBA guidelines at 13 CFR part 134 (see FAR subpart 19.3). Pursuant to Public Law 114-328, SBA will hear cases related to size and status, including ownership and control challenges under the VA Veterans First Contracting Program (see 38 U.S.C. 8127(f)(8)).

      Subpart 819.5—Small Business Total Set-Asides, Partial Set-Asides, and Reserves

        819.501   General.

#### § 819.501

        819.501-70   General principles for setting aside VA acquisitions.

#### § 819.501-70

        (a) The following principles apply to VA acquisitions under this subpart:

        (1) Before setting aside or reserving an acquisition for small businesses under FAR subpart 19.5, contracting officers shall refer to 808.002 and 819.203-70 and subpart 819.70 for VA SDVOSB/VOSB priorities and preferences.

        (2) Set-asides under the Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart 819.70 (see 819.7006 and 819.7007) have precedence over other small business set-asides authorized in FAR part 19, both above and below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). An SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside satisfies the legislative requirement to reserve actions below the SAT for small business.

        (3) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(d), set-asides for SDVOSBs/VOSBs are mandatory whenever a contracting officer has a reasonable expectation of receiving two or more offers/quotes from eligible, capable and verified firms, and that an award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government. (VA Rule of Two (see 802.101))

        (b) The set-aside principles in this section apply to VA acquisitions even when a procuring activity is meeting its goals or is planning the use of an interagency agreement, Federal Supply Schedule, or a multiple award contract, including a Governmentwide contract vehicle.

        (c) The requirements in this section apply to all VA acquisitions under this subpart, including reserves, orders, and BPAs under multiple award contracts, GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and Multi-Agency Contracts (MACs) awarded by another agency. A set-aside restricted to SDVOSBs/VOSBs pursuant to subpart 819.70 satisfies competition requirements in FAR part 6, as well as fair opportunity requirements for orders under multiple-award contracts (see FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)).

        819.502   Setting aside acquisitions.

#### § 819.502

        819.502-1   Requirements for setting aside acquisitions.

#### § 819.502-1

        (b) Contracting officers shall refer to 808.002 for the VA policy regarding priorities for use of SDVOSBs/VOSBs and mandatory Government sources.

        819.502-2   Total small business set-asides.

#### § 819.502-2

        (a) If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, shall be resolicited on an unrestricted basis or, if permitted in the solicitation, the contracting officer will follow the tiered set-aside evaluation procedures in 819.7010, Tiered evaluation, and proceed to the next eligible tier in the evaluation process.

        819.507   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 819.507

        819.507-70   Additional VA solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 819.507-70

        For contracts, orders, or BPAs to be issued as SDVOSB/VOSB reserve, tiered evaluation, set-aside, or sole source, see 819.7011. Also see subparts 808.4 and 815.3 and 819.203-70 for requirements and clauses applicable to VA small business set-asides.

      Subpart 819.6 [Reserved]

      Subpart 819.7—The Small Business Subcontracting Program

        819.704-70   VA subcontracting plan requirements.

#### § 819.704-70

        (a) VA's current subcontracting goals, at a minimum, shall be inserted into all solicitations which contain FAR clause 52.219-9. To the maximum extent possible, the contracting officer shall ensure that individual subcontracting plans submitted by offerors subject to clause 852.219-70, VA Small Business Subcontracting Plan Minimum Requirements, include SDVOSB/VOSB goals that are commensurate with the annual VA SDVOSB/VOSB subcontracting goals (see 819.708).

        (1) Only firms listed as verified on the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database (see subpart 819.70) will count towards SDVOSB and VOSB goals.

        (2) A contractor may reasonably rely on a subcontractor's status as shown in the VIP database as of the date of subcontract award, provided the contractor retains records of the results of the VIP database query.

        (3) In furtherance of 38 U.S.C. 8127(a)(4), contractors shall submit subcontracting plan reports to OSDBU as set forth in clause 852.219-70, VA Small Business Subcontracting Plan Minimum Requirements. Unless otherwise directed by OSDBU, VA Form 0896A, Report of Subcontracts to Small and Veteran Owned Business, shall be used to submit the required information.

        (b) Subcontracting goals should be expressed as a percentage of total dollars to be subcontracted unless otherwise stated in the solicitation.

        (c) If an offeror proposes to use an SDVOSB/VOSB subcontractor for the purpose of receiving SDVOSB/VOSB evaluation factors credit pursuant to 808.405-70 or 815.304-70, the contracting officer shall ensure that the offeror, if awarded the contract, actually uses the proposed subcontractor or another SDVOSB/VOSB for that subcontract or for work of similar value, in accordance with clause 852.208-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors—Orders or BPAs, or 852.215-71, Evaluation Factor Commitments.

        (d) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB or VOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years. This includes the debarment of all principals in the business (see 809.406-270).

        819.708   Contract clauses.

#### § 819.708

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert clause 852.219-70, Small Business Subcontracting Plan Minimum Requirements, in solicitations and contracts that include FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

      Subpart 819.8—Contracting With the Small Business Administration (the 8(a) Program)

        819.800   General.

#### § 819.800

        (e) The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have entered into a Partnership Agreement delegating SBA's contract execution and administrative functions to VA. Contracting officers shall follow the alternate procedures in the Partnership Agreement and this subpart, as applicable, to award an 8(a) contract. In the event the Partnership Agreement ceases to be in effect, contracting officers shall follow the procedures in FAR subpart 19.8.

        819.811   Preparing the contracts.

#### § 819.811

        819.811-370   VA/SBA Partnership Agreement and contract clauses.

#### § 819.811-370

        (a) Before placing new requirements under the 8(a) program, the contracting officer must determine whether an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside is mandated under the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101). If the determination does not result in an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside, the contracting officer may consider the 8(a) program.

        (b) The Partnership Agreement provides that SBA can release procurements already in the program whenever an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside is feasible.

        (c) When an 8(a) acquisition is processed pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the contracting officer shall:

        (1) For competitive solicitations and awards, use the clause at 852.219-71, VA Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Participants, substituting paragraph (c) of FAR 52.219-18, Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Participants, with paragraph (c) contained in 852.219-71.

        (2) For noncompetitive solicitations and awards insert the clause at 852.219-72, Notification of Section 8(a) Direct Awards, instead of the prescribed FAR clauses at 52.219-11, Special 8(a) Contract Conditions; 52.219-12, Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions; and 52.219-17, Section 8(a) Award.

        (3) In all instances, contracting include the clause at FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, or if applicable 52.219-33, Nonmanufacturer Rule.

      Subpart 819.70—The VA Veterans First Contracting Program

        819.7001   General.

#### § 819.7001

        (a) Sections 502 and 503 of Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, as amended (38 U.S.C. 8127- 8128), authorizes a VA specific program to increase contracting opportunities for eligible small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans with service-connected disabilities and small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans. Once ownership and control by these veterans is verified, these businesses are referred to as service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) or collectively SDVOSB/VOSB for ease of reference.

        (b) The program as implemented in this subpart shall be known as the Veterans First Contracting Program. The purpose of the program is to increase contracting opportunities and provide for priority in the award of contracts and subcontracts to SDVOSBs/VOSBs so they can fully participate in the VA contracting process. Eligible SDVOSBs qualify for any VOSB preferences under this subpart.

        (c) VA's program is codified at 38 U.S.C. 8127(b), (c), and (d), and provides the authority for VA contracting officers to make awards to SDVOSBs/VOSBs using restricted competition, as well as other than full and open competition (sole source), as set-forth in this subpart. Additionally, 38 U.S.C. 8128 provides the authority for VA to give SDVOSBs/VOSBs priority in the awarding of contracts and subcontracts using evaluation preferences.

        (d) Contracting officers shall award contracts by restricting competition to eligible SDVOSBs/VOSBs as provided in 819.7006 and 819.7007. The contracting officer may use other preferences in this subpart as appropriate and in accordance with procuring activity guidelines.

        (e) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128, contracting officers shall give priority to SDVOSBs/VOSBs if such business concern(s) also meet the requirements of that contracting preference. In carrying out this responsibility, contracting officers shall include the clauses prescribed at 808.405-570 and 815.304-71 in competitive solicitations and contracts that are not set-aside for SDVOSB/VOSB, including those under FAR part 12. The requirement in this paragraph (e) applies even when using a contracting preference under FAR part 19 (for example, a women-owned small business set-aside).

        (f) The attainment of goals or the use of interagency vehicles or Governmentwide contract vehicles ( Federal Supply Schedules (FSS)) does not relieve the contracting officer from using SDVOSB/VOSB set-asides and other preferences as provided in subpart 819.70. Moreover, if the VA enters into a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with any governmental entity to acquire goods or services, the entity acting on behalf of the VA through such an interagency acquisition or other agreement will comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with the provisions of the Veterans First Contracting Program as set forth in this subpart.

        (g) Contracting officers shall ensure awards are made using the VA hierarchy of SDVOSB/VOSB preferences in this subpart. Specifically, the contracting officer will consider preferences for eligible SDVOSBs first, then preferences for other eligible VOSBs.

        (h) When an offer of an SDVOSB/VOSB prime contractor includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors and specifically identifies the first-tier subcontractor(s) in the proposal, the contracting officer must consider the capabilities, past performance, and experience of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime contractor if the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime does not independently demonstrate capabilities and past performance necessary for award.

        819.7002   Applicability.

#### § 819.7002

        Unless otherwise exempted by law, this subpart applies to VA contracting activities and contracts (see FAR 2.101) including BPAs and orders under FAR subpart 8.4 and acquisition of commercial products or commercial services under FAR part 12. In addition, this subpart applies to VA contractors, their subcontractors and to any Government entity that has a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with the VA to acquire goods and services on behalf of the VA (see 817.501). For applicability and VA policy regarding priorities for use of mandatory Government sources see 808.002.

        819.7003   Eligibility.

#### § 819.7003

        (a) SDVOSB/VOSB size eligibility, challenges, and appeals are governed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR parts 121, 125, and 134, except where directed otherwise by this part or 38 CFR part 74.

        (b) At the time of submission of offers/quotes, and at the time of award of any contract, the offeror must represent to the contracting officer that it is a—

        (1) SDVOSB or VOSB eligible under this subpart;

        (2) Small business concern under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the acquisition; and

        (3) Listed as a verified SDVOSB/VOSB on the VA's Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at .

        (c) A joint venture may be considered eligible if it meets the requirements in 13 CFR part 125; and the joint venture is listed in the VIP database.

        (d) To receive a benefit under the Veterans First Contacting Program, an otherwise eligible SDVOSB/VOSB must also meet SBA requirements at 13 CFR parts 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule requirements at 13 CFR 121.406(b) and limitations on subcontracting at 13 CFR 125.6. The nonmanufacturer rule (see 13 CFR 121.406) and the limitations on subcontracting requirements apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set-aside and sole source contracts above the micro-purchase threshold. An offeror shall submit a certification of compliance to be considered eligible for any award under this part (see 819.7004).

        (e) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB/VOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years. This includes the debarment of all principals in the business. See 809.406-270.

        819.7004   Limitations on subcontracting compliance requirements.

#### § 819.7004

        (a) A contract awarded under this subpart is subject to the SBA limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 125.6, provided that—

        (1) Only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible and/or “similarly situated” under an SDVOSB sole source or set-aside.

        (2) A VOSB is subject to the same limitations on subcontracting that apply to an SDVOSB.

        (3) Any VIP-listed SDVOSB/VOSB is considered eligible and/or “similarly situated” under a VOSB sole source or set-aside.

        (b) Pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127(k)(2), a contracting officer may award a contract under this subpart only after obtaining from the offeror a certification that the offeror will comply with the limitations on subcontracting requirement as provided in the solicitation and which shall be included in the resultant contract (see 819.7011).

        (1) The formal certification must be completed, signed and returned with the offeror's bid, quotation, or proposal.

        (2) The Government will not consider offers for award from offerors that do not provide the certification with their bid, quotation, or proposal, and all such responses will be deemed ineligible for evaluation and award.

        (c) An otherwise eligible first tier subcontractor must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.

        (d) An SDVOSB/VOSB awarded a contract on the basis of a set-aside, sole source, or an evaluation preference is required to comply with the limitations on subcontracting either by—

        (1) The end of the base term, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or, by the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract, at the contracting officer's discretion; and

        (2) For an order set aside for SDVOSB/VOSB as described in 808.405 and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F), or for an order issued directly to an SDVOSB/VOSB in accordance with FAR 19.504(c)(1)(ii), by the end of the performance period for the order.

        (e) The contracting officer may also, at their discretion, require the contractor to demonstrate its compliance with the limitations on subcontracting at any time during performance of the contract, and upon completion of a contract if the information regarding such compliance is not already available to the contracting officer. Evidence of compliance includes, but is not limited to, invoices, copies of subcontracts, or a list of the value of tasks performed.

        (f) Pursuant to Public Law 116-183, the Office of the Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), will implement a process to monitor compliance with the requirement in this section. The OSDBU and CAO shall jointly refer any violations or suspected violations to the VA Office of Inspector General. This referral obligation does not relieve contracting officers of their obligation to report suspected violations of law to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).

        (1) If the Secretary or designee determines in consultation with the Inspector General that an SDVOSB/VOSB awarded a contract pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127 did not act in good faith with respect to the requirements described in 819.7003(d), such SDVOSB/VOSB shall be subject to any or all of the following—

        (i) Referral to the VA Suspension and Debarment Committee;

        (ii) A fine under section 16(g)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 645(g)(1)); and

        (iii) Prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. 1001.

        (2) The Inspector General shall report to the Congress annually on the number of referred violations and suspected violations, and the disposition of such violations, including the number of small business concerns suspended or debarred from federal contracting or referred for Department of Justice prosecution.

        819.7005   Contracting order of priority.

#### § 819.7005

        (a) In determining the acquisition strategy applicable to a procurement requirement not otherwise covered under 808.002, the contracting officer shall observe the order of contracting preferences in 38 U.S.C. 8127(h).

        (b) Specifically, preferences for awarding contracts to small business concerns shall be applied in the following order of priority:

        (1) Contracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans with service-connected disabilities as provided in this subpart.

        (2) Contracts to small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans that are not covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section as provided in this subpart.

        (3) Contracts awarded pursuant to—

        (i) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a) as provided in FAR subpart 19.8; or

        (ii) Section 31 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657a) as provided in FAR subpart 19.13.

        (4) Contracts awarded pursuant to any other small business set aside contracting preference, with due deference to the priority for awarding to women-owned small businesses as provided in FAR 19.203(b) through (e) and FAR subpart 19.15.

        819.7006   VA service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside procedures.

#### § 819.7006

        (a) The contracting officer shall consider SDVOSB set-asides before considering VOSB set-asides. Except as authorized by 808.002, 813.106, 819.7007, and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set-aside a contract action exceeding the micro-purchase threshold for competition restricted to VIP-listed SDVOSB upon a reasonable expectation based on market research that—

        (1) Offers/quotations will be received from two or more eligible VIP-listed SDVOSBs; and

        (2) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the Government.

        (b) When conducting SDVOSB set-asides, the contracting officer shall ensure that—

        (1) Offerors are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database at the time of submission of offers and at time of award; and

        (2) Offerors affirmatively represent their SDVOSB and small business status based on the size standard corresponding to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the solicitation/contract, as set forth in 819.7003(b) or (c).

        (c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible VIP-listed SDVOSB, the contracting officer may make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible SDVOSBs, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for VOSB competition if warranted or otherwise procured using the most appropriate strategy based on the results of market research.

        819.7007   VA veteran-owned small business set-aside procedures.

#### § 819.7007

        (a) The contracting officer shall consider SDVOSB set-asides before considering VOSB set-asides. Except as authorized by 808.002, 813.106, 819.7007, and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set aside a contract action exceeding the micro-purchase threshold for competition restricted to VIP-listed VOSBs upon a reasonable expectation based on market research that—

        (1) Offers/quotations will be received from two or more VIP-listed VOSBs; and

        (2) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the Government.

        (b) When conducting VOSB set-asides, the contracting officer shall ensure that—

        (1) Offerors are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database at the time of submission of offers and at time of award; and

        (2) Offerors affirmatively represent their SDVOSB/VOSB and small business status based on the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation/contract (see 819.7003(b) and (c)).

        (c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible VIP-listed VOSB in response to a VOSB set-aside, the contracting officer may make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer decides not to make an award to the single acceptable offer received, or if the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible VOSBs, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for other small business programs in accordance with 819.7005 or otherwise procured using the most appropriate strategy based on the results of market research.

        819.7008   Sole source awards to verified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.

#### § 819.7008

        (a) A contracting officer may award a contract to a VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) using other than competitive procedures provided—

        (1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;

        (2) The requirement is synopsized and the required justification pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii) is posted in accordance with FAR part 5;

        (3) The SDVOSB has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and

        (4) In the estimation of the contracting officer contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government.

        (b) The contracting officer's determination to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. To ensure that opportunities are available to the broadest number of SDVOSBs, this authority is to be used only when in the best interest of the Government.

        (c) A determination that only one SDVOSB can meet the requirement is not required. However, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii), contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by a written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and 6.304, as applicable.

        (d) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure the business meets eligibility requirements in 819.7003.

        (e) A procurement requirement estimated to exceed the legislative threshold of $5 million shall not be split or subdivided to permit the use of this SDVOSB sole source authority.

        819.7009   Sole source awards to verified veteran-owned small businesses.

        (1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;

        (2) The requirement is synopsized and the required justification pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii) is posted in accordance with FAR part 5;

        (3) The VOSB has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance;

        (4) In the estimation of the contracting officer contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government; and

        (5) No responsible SDVOSB has been identified.

        (b) The contracting officer's determination to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. To ensure that opportunities are available to the broadest number of VOSBs, this authority is to be used only when in the best interest of the Government.

        (c) A determination that only one VOSB can meet the requirement is not required. However, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii), contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by a written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and 6.304, as applicable.

        (d) When conducting a VOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure the business meets eligibility requirements in 819.7003.

        819.7010   Tiered set-aside evaluation.

#### § 819.7010

        (a) Pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127 and under limited circumstances as set forth in this section, contracting officers may consider using a tiered set-aside evaluation approach to minimize delays in the re-solicitation process.

        (b) Tiered evaluation of offers is a procedure that may be used in competitive negotiated acquisitions, including construction and acquisitions for commercial products and commercial services when the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) determination indicates a set-aside is required, but other circumstances preclude a confident conclusion that an award can be made at the SDVOSB or VOSB tier. The contracting officer—

        (1) Solicits and receives offers from targeted tiers of small business groups, with SDVOSB as the first tier and VOSB as the second tier;

        (2) Establishes a tiered order of priority for evaluating offers that is specified in the solicitation; and

        (3) If no award can be made at the first tier, evaluates offers at the next lower tier, until award can be made.

        (c) Market research, which shall be conducted and documented in advance of issuing the solicitation, will inform which of the following types of tiers will be included in the solicitation:

        (1) Tiered evaluations limited to SDVOSBs or VOSBs;

        (2) Tiered evaluations including 8(a) and HUBZone small businesses; or

        (3) Tiered evaluations including all other small business concerns.

        (d) The tiered order of priority shall be consistent with 819.7005. Consideration shall be given to HUBZone and 8(a) small business concerns before evaluating offers from other small business concerns.

        819.7011   Contract clauses.

Such incidents include instances in which the contractor did not adhere to Privacy Act/PII contractual requirements.

> [84 FR 45681, Aug. 30, 2019]

        824.103-70   Protection of privacy—general requirements and procedures related to Business Associate Agreements.

#### § 824.103-70

        To ensure compliance with unique responsibilities to protect protected health information (PHI), contractors performing under VA contracts subject to unique PHI and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) shall comply with requirements and the clause (852.204-71, Information and Information Systems Security) prescribed at 804.1903.

        (a)  Under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (see 45 CFR part 160), a covered entity (Veterans Health Administration (VHA)) must have a satisfactory assurance that its PHI will be safeguarded from misuse. To do so, a covered entity enters into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with a contractor (now the business associate), which obligates the business associate to only use the covered entity's PHI for the purposes for which it was engaged, provide the same protections and safeguards as is required from the covered entity, and agree to the same disclosure restrictions to PHI that is required of the covered entity in situations where a contractor—

        (1) Creates, receives, maintains, or transmits VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI in order to perform certain health care operations activities or functions on behalf of the covered entity; or

        (2) Provides one or more of the services specified in the HIPAA Privacy Rule to or for the covered entity.

        (b)  VHA is the only administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs that is a HIPAA covered entity under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

        (c)  BAAs are issued by VHA or may be issued by other VA programs in support of VHA. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires VHA to execute compliant BAAs with persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI in order to perform certain activities, functions or services to, for, or on behalf of VHA.

        (1) There may be other VA components or staff offices which also provide certain services and support to VHA and must receive PHI in order to do so. If these components award contracts or enter into other agreements, purchase/delivery orders, modifications, and issue Governmentwide purchase card transactions to help in the delivery of these services to VHA, they will also fall within the requirement to obtain a satisfactory assurance from these contractors by executing a BAA.

        (2) Contractors or other entities supporting VHA required to create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI shall be required to execute a BAA as mandated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule and requested by the contracting officer, the contracting officer's representative (COR) or the cognizant privacy officer—

        (i) Whether via a contract or agreement with VHA; or

        (ii) Whether provided from or through another VA administration or staff activity contract for supplies, services or support that involves performing a certain activity, function or service to, for, or on behalf of VHA ( VA Directive 6066, Protected Health Information (PHI) and Business Associate Agreements Management).

        (d)  A prime contractor required to execute a BAA shall also obtain a satisfactory assurance, in the form of a BAA, that any of its subcontractors who will also create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI will comply with HIPAA requirements to the same degree as the contractor. A contractor employing a subcontractor who creates, receives, maintains, or transmits VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such VHA PHI under a contract or agreement is required to execute a BAA with each of its subcontractors which also obligates the subcontractor ( also a business associate) to provide the same protections and safeguards and agree to the same disclosure restrictions to VHA's PHI that is required of the covered entity and the prime contractor.

        (a)  As required by 38 U.S.C. 5725 any contracts where sensitive personal information such as PHI must be disclosed to the contractor for the contractor to perform certain functions or services on behalf of VHA shall include a liquidated damages clause as prescribed at 811.503-70.

        (b)  A liquidated damages clause is required ( 811.503-70) when performance under a contract requires a contractor to enter into a Business Associate Agreement with VHA because the contractor or its subcontractor is required to create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI, for certain services or functions, on behalf of VHA. The liquidated damages clause shall be added even in situations where the prime contractor never directly receives VA's sensitive personal information and the same flows directly to the prime contractor's subcontractor.

        (b) Upon receipt of a request, the contracting officer shall provide the requester with the name of the cognizant VA FOIA Service Office. The VA FOIA Service Office (see ) is the focal point for all FOIA requests and official information may only be released through the cognizant FOIA Service or their authorized designee.

        (1) Employed at the site of the contract work; and

        (2) Working on the contract for which indemnification is granted.

As stated in 27 CFR 19.426, agencies of the United States Government that wish to obtain either specially denatured spirits or spirits free of tax for nonbeverage purposes must apply for and receive a permit on form TTB F 5150.33 or must have a previously issued permit on ATF Form 1444.

        (2) When purchasing spirits under a tax exemption, the contracting officer shall indicate in the contract document the basis for the exemption and make a copy of the permit available to the contractor. Upon receipt of the spirits, the contractor shall return the permit to the contracting officer unless future orders are anticipated or as directed by the contracting officer.

        (3) Department of Veterans Affairs activities that require spirits free of tax for beverage purposes under 26 U.S.C. 7510 must provide a proper purchase order signed by the head of the agency or an authorized designee.

        (b)  Contracting officers may make purchases of excise tax-free spirits, including denatured alcohol and specially denatured alcohol only from qualified distillery plants or bonded dealers.

        (1) Permits previously issued on Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) Form 1444, Tax-Free Spirits for Use of United States, remain valid until surrendered or cancelled.

        (2) A copy of the current ATF Form 1444 or TTB Form 5150.33 shall be made available to the supplier with the initial order. The permit number only needs to be referenced on any future orders with the same supplier.

        (c)  No tax exemption form or ATF/TTB permit is required for the tax-free procurement of wine from bonded wine premises. The purchase order must show the kind, quantity, and alcohol content of the wine and must state the purpose for which wine is to be used (see 27 CFR 24.293). An extra copy of a properly executed purchase order may be furnished to the bonded wine premises from which wine is purchased to facilitate record keeping. The order must be signed by the head of the contracting activity or their designee.

      Subpart 831.70—Contract Cost Principles and Procedures for Veterans Services

        831.7000   Scope of subpart.

#### § 831.7000

        This subpart contains general cost principles and procedures for the determination and allowance of costs or negotiation of prices under cost reimbursement or fixed-price contracts for providing vocational rehabilitation, education, and training to eligible Veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, (referred to as a “chapter 31 program”). This subpart applies to contracts with educational institutions as well as to contracts with commercial and non-profit organizations.

        831.7000-1   Definitions.

#### § 831.7000-1

        refers to the vocational rehabilitation and employment (VR&E) program that provides training and rehabilitation for Veterans with service-connected disabilities under chapter 31 of Title 38 U.S.C.

        means those supplies which are required for instruction in the classroom, shop school, and laboratory of an educational institution, which are consumed, destroyed, or expended by either the student, instructor or both in the process of use, and which have to be replaced at frequent intervals without adding to the value of the institution's physical property.

        means a student in equal or like situations as a person who is neither receiving educational or training benefits under chapter 31 or chapter 33 of Title 38 U.S.C. or the savings provisions of section 12(a) of Public Law 85-857, nor having all or any part of tuition fees or other charges paid by the educational institution.

        means a specialized structure program that is facility or community based and designated to assist an individual in acquiring or improving work skills, work behaviors, work tolerance, interpersonal skills or work ethics.

        831.7001   Allowable costs and negotiated prices under vocational rehabilitation and education contracts.

#### § 831.7001

        831.7001-1   Tuition.

#### § 831.7001-1

        (a) Tuition and enrollment fees shall be paid at the institution's customary amount that—

        (1) Does not exceed the tuition charged to similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students; and

        (2) Is equal to the lowest price offered or published for the entire course, semester, quarter, or term.

        (b) The cost of the Veteran student's tuition and fees under a contract shall be offset by—

        (1) Any amount of tuition and fees that are waived by a State or other government authority; or

        (2) Any amounts the Veteran student receives from a fellowship, scholarship, grant-in-aid, assistantship, or similar award that limits its use to payment of tuition, fees, or other charges that VA normally pays as part of a chapter 31 program.

        (c) VA will not pay tuition or incidental fees to institutions or establishments furnishing apprentice or on-the-job training. VA may elect to pay charges or expenses that fall into either of the following categories:

        (1) Charges customarily made by a nonprofit workshop or similar establishment for providing work adjustment training to similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students even if the trainee receives an incentive wage as part of the training.

        (2) Training expenses incurred by an employer who provides on-the-job training following rehabilitation to the point of employability when VA determines that the additional training is necessary.

        831.7001-2   Special services or courses.

#### § 831.7001-2

        Special services or courses are those services or courses that VA requests that are supplementary to those the institution customarily provides for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students, and that the contracting officer considers them to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee. VA will negotiate the costs/prices of special services or courses prior to ordering them.

        831.7001-3   Books, supplies, and equipment required to be personally owned.

#### § 831.7001-3

        (a)  VA will provide reimbursement for books, equipment, or other supplies of the same variety, quality, or amount that all students taking the same course or courses are customarily required to own personally. VA will provide reimbursement for items that the institution does not specifically require for pursuit of the course if VA determines that such items are needed because of the demands of the course, general possession by other students, and the disadvantage imposed on a Veteran student by not having the item.

        (b)  Agreements in which VA would pay the institution a partial payment with the remainder to be paid by the Veteran student are not authorized.

        (c)  The institution's costs in connection with a Veteran student's thesis are considered supplies and are therefore authorized for reimbursement if the Veteran student's committee chairman, major professor, department head, or appropriate dean certifies that the thesis is a course requirement and the expenses are required to complete the thesis. These expenses may include research expenses, typing, printing, microfilming, or otherwise reproducing the required number of copies.

        (d)  Books, supplies, and equipment that the institution purchases specifically for trainees will be reimbursed at the net cost to the institution. The VA shall reimburse the institution for books, supplies, and equipment when these items are—

        (1) Issued to students from its own bookstore or supply store;

        (2) Issued to students from retail stores or other non-institutionally owned establishments not owned by the contractor/institution but arranged or designated by them in cooperation with VA; or

        (3) Rented or leased books, supplies and equipment and are issued to students for survey classes when it is customary that students are not required to own the books.

        (e)  VA shall reimburse the institution for any handling charges not to exceed more than 10 percent of the allowable charge for the books, equipment or other supplies unless—

        (1) The tuition covers the charges for supplies or rentals or a stipulated fee is assessed to all students; or

        (2) The handling charge is for Government-owned books that the contractor procures from the Library of Congress.

        831.7001-4   Medical services and hospital care.

#### § 831.7001-4

        (a) VA may pay the customary student health fee when payment of the fee is required for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students. If payment of the fee is not required for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students, payment may be made if VA determines that payment is in the best interest of the Veteran student and the Government.

        (b) When the customary Veteran student's health fee does not cover medical services or hospital care, but these medical services are available in an institution-operated facility or with doctors and hospitals in the immediate area through a prior arrangement, VA may provide reimbursement for these services in a contract for the services if—

        (1) An arrangement is necessary to provide timely medical services for Veteran-students attending the facility under provisions of chapter 31; and

        (2) The general rates established for medical services do not exceed the rates established by VA.

        (c) VA may reimburse a rehabilitation facility for incidental medical services provided during a Veteran student's program at the facility.

        831.7001-5   Consumable instructional supplies.

#### § 831.7001-5

        (a) VA will provide reimbursement for consumable instructional supplies that the institution requires for the instruction of all students, Veteran or non-Veteran students, pursuing the same or comparable course or courses when—

        (1) The supplies are entirely consumed in the fabrication of a required project; or

        (2) The supplies are not consumed but are of such a nature that they cannot be salvaged from the end product for reuse by disassembling or dismantling the end product.

        (b) VA will not provide reimbursement for consumable instructional supplies if any of the following apply:

        (1) The supplies can be salvaged for reuse.

        (2) The supplies are used in a project that the student has elected as an alternate class project to produce an end product of greater value than that normally required to learn the skills of the occupation, and the end product will become the Veteran's property upon completion.

        (3) The supplies are used in a project that the institution has selected to provide the student with a more elaborate end product than is required to provide adequate instruction as an inducement to the Veteran student to elect a particular course of study.

        (4) The sale value of the end product is equal to or greater than the cost of supplies plus assembly, and the supplies have not been reasonably used so that the supplies are not readily salvaged from the end product to be reused for instructional purposes.

        (5) The end product is of permanent value and retained by the institution.

        (6) A third party loans the articles or equipment for repair or improvement and the third party would otherwise pay a commercial price for the repair or improvement.

        (7) The number of projects resulting in end products exceeds the number normally required to teach the recognized job operations and processes of the occupation stipulated in the approved course of study.

        (8) The cost of supplies is included in the charge for tuition or as a fee designated for such purpose.

        831.7001-6   Reimbursement for other supplies and services.

#### § 831.7001-6

        VA will provide reimbursement for other services and assistance that may be authorized under applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 regulations, including, but not limited to, employment and self-employment services, initial and extended evaluation services, and independent living services.

        (b) In the event of a dispute not arising under, but relating to, the contract, as permitted by FAR 33.213(b), if the contracting officer directs continued performance and considers providing financing for such continued performance, the contracting officer shall contact OGC for advice prior to requesting higher level approval for or authorizing such financing. The contracting officer shall document in the contract file any required approvals and how the Government's interest was properly secured with respect to such financing (see FAR 32.202-4 and VAAR subpart 832.2).

        (1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies, or a recommendation that no further action is warranted;

        (2) When the investigation results in a research misconduct finding, ensure the matter is adjudicated by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is organizationally separated from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication shall include a review of the investigation record and a recommendation of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions; and

        (3) When an investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's recommendation and notification of any proposed corrective action, and the subject's written response, if any. The Contracting Officer will review the documentation to determine whether the proposed corrective action can proceed.

        (d) The VA may elect to act in lieu of the Contractor in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that—

        (e) The Contractor shall provide safeguards for information received and protect informants, witnesses and respondents of allegations as follows:

        (1) The Contractor shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the Contractor without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations.

        (2) The Contractor shall also assure the respondent that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegations and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support each allegation. Respondents must be given the opportunity to prepare a response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.

        (f)  The Contractor shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts the adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.

        852.235-71   Protection of Human Subjects.

#### § 852.235-71

        As prescribed at 835.003-72, insert the following clause:

        (a) Research involving human subjects is not permitted under this award unless expressly authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. Such authorization will specify the details of the approved research involving human subjects and will be incorporated by reference into this contract.

        (b) The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the “Common Rule”), adopted by VA (see 38 CFR part 16), requires Contractors to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human subjects in research. The Common Rule defines a “human subject” as a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The term “research” means a systematic investigation, including research development and/or testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalized knowledge. The Common Rule also sets forth categories of research that may be considered exempt from 15 CFR part 27. These categories may be found at 15 CFR 27.101.

        (c) Should research involving human subjects be included in the proposal, prior to issuance of an award, the Contractor shall submit the following documentation to the Contracting Officer:

        (1) Documentation to verify that the Contractor has established a relationship with an appropriate Institutional Review Board (“cognizant IRB”). An appropriate IRB is one that is located within the United States and within the community in which the research will be conducted;

        (2) Documentation to verify that the cognizant IRB possesses a valid registration with the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Human Research Protections (“OHRP”);

        (3) Documentation to verify that the Contractor has a valid Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) issued by OHRP.

        (d) Prior to starting any research involving human subjects, the Contractor shall submit appropriate documentation to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. This documentation may include:

        (1) Copies of the research protocol, all questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms approved by the cognizant IRB;

        (2) Documentation of approval for the research protocol, questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms by the cognizant IRB;

        (3) Documentation of continuing IRB approval by the cognizant IRB at appropriate intervals as designated by the IRB, but not less than annually; and/or

        (4) Documentation to support an exemption for the project from the Common Rule (Note: this option is not available for activities that fall under 45 CFR part 46, subpart C).

        (e) Additionally, if the Contractor modifies a research protocol, questionnaire, survey, advertisement, or informed consent form approved by the cognizant IRB, the Contractor shall submit a copy of all modified material along with documentation of approval for said modification by the cognizant IRB to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. The Contractor shall not implement any IRB approved modification without written approval by the Contracting Officer.

        (f) No work involving human subjects may be undertaken, conducted, or costs incurred and/or charged to the project, until the Contracting Officer approves the required appropriate documentation in writing.

        (g) The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for the performance of all work and services involving the use of human subjects under this contract in a proper manner and as safely as is feasible. The parties hereto agree that the Contractor retains the right to control and direct the performance of all work under this contract. Nothing in this contract shall be deemed to constitute the Contractor or any subcontractor, agent or employee of the Contractor, or any other person, organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever, as the agency or employee of the Government. The Contractor agrees that it has entered into this contract and will discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgement or otherwise, as an independent Contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the Contractor or its employees.

        (h) If at any time during performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health (NIH), that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements, the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend the research and further payments under this contract until the Contractor corrects such noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be communicated by telephone and confirmed in writing. If the Contractor fails to complete the corrective action within the period of time designated in the Contracting Officer's written notice of suspension, the Contracting Officer may, in consultation with OPRR, NIH, terminate this contract and the Contractor's name may be removed from the list of those Contractors with approved Department of Health and Human Services Human Subject Assurances.

        The costs for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and other expenses are allowable under a contract with an institution, training establishment, or employer for the training and rehabilitation of eligible Veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, provided the services meet the conditions in the following definitions:

        (a)  means a course of education or training conducted by mail consisting of regular lessons or reading assignments, the preparation of required written work that involves the application of principles studied in each lesson, the correction of assigned work with such suggestions or recommendation as may be necessary to instruct the student, the keeping of student achievement records, and issuance of a diploma, certificate, or other evidence to the student upon satisfactorily completing the requirements of the course.

        (b)  means those services or courses that VA requests that are supplementary to those the institution customarily provides for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students and that the contracting officer considers to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee.

        871.205   Proration of charges.

#### § 871.205

        A contract must include the exact formula agreed on for the proration of charges in the event that the Veteran's program is interrupted or discontinued before the end of the term, semester, quarter, or other period, or the program is completed in less time than stated in the contract.

        (i) An institution of higher learning that uses a standard unit of credit recognized by accrediting associations. Such institutions include those that are members of recognized national or regional educational accrediting associations, and those that, although not members of such accrediting associations, grant standard units of credit acceptable at full value without examination by collegiate institutions that are members of national or regional accrediting associations.

        (c) Proration of charges does not apply to a fee for noncontinuing service, such as a registration fee, etc.

        (d) The period for which payment of charges may be made is the period of actual enrollment and is subject to the following:

        (1) The effective date is the date of the trainee's entrance into training status, except that payment may be made for an entire semester, quarter, or term in institutions operating on that basis if the trainee enters no later than the final date set by the institution for enrolling for full credit.

        (2) In those cases where the institution has not set a final date for enrolling for full credit or does not set a date acceptable to VA, payment may be prorated on the basis of attendance, regardless of the refund policy.

        (3) If an institution customarily charges for the amount of credit or number of hours of attendance for which a trainee enrolls, payment may be made on that basis when a trainee enrolls after the final date permitted for carrying full credit for the semester or term.

        871.208   Rehabilitation facilities.

#### § 871.208

        Charges by rehabilitation facilities for the rehabilitation services provided under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 are paid in the same manner as charges for educational and vocational services through contract, agreement, or other arrangement.

#### § 873.101

      (a)  In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 8153, to secure health-care resources which otherwise might not be feasibly available, or to effectively utilize certain other health-care resources, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may make arrangements by contract for the mutual use, or exchange of use, of health-care resources between VA health-care facilities and any health-care provider, or other entity or individual. This part prescribes simplified procedures for contracts with entities not affiliated with VA under 38 U.S.C. 7302 to secure health-care resources that are a commercial service, or the use of medical equipment or space. VA may enter into such a contract if such resources are not, or would not be, used to their maximum effective capacity. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b)  The procedures in this part shall be used in conjunction with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and other parts of the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR). However, when a policy or procedure in the FAR or another part of the VAAR is inconsistent with the procedures contained in this part, this part shall take precedence. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.102   Definitions.

#### § 873.102

      means a service that is offered and sold competitively in the commercial marketplace, is performed under standard commercial terms and conditions, and is procured using firm-fixed price contracts. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.103   Priority sources.

#### § 873.103

      Except for the acquisition of covered services available from the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled and the AbilityOne Program (see FAR subpart 8.7), there are no priority sources for the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space in accordance with 808.002(a)(2) and 873.107. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.104   Competition requirements.

#### § 873.104

      (a)  (1) A health-care resource may be acquired on a sole source basis if a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the VA in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 7302, including medical practice groups and other entities associated with affiliated institutions, blood banks, organ banks, or research centers. (38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(A))

      (2) Acquisitions of health-care resources identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not required to be publicized as otherwise required by 873.108 or FAR 5.101.

      (b)  (1) If the health-care resource required is a commercial service or the use of medical equipment or space, and is to be acquired from an entity not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, contracting officers shall permit all responsible sources, as appropriate, to submit a bid, proposal, or quotation for the resource to be procured, and provide for the consideration by VA of bids, proposals, or quotations so submitted. (38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(B))

      (2) Acquisition of health-care resources identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be publicized as otherwise required by 873.108. Moreover, for any such acquisition described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to be conducted on a sole source basis, the contracting officer must prepare a justification that includes the information and is approved at the levels prescribed in FAR 6.303. (38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(D))

      873.105   Acquisition planning.

#### § 873.105

      (a) For the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space where the acquisition is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), an acquisition team must be assembled. The team shall be tailored by the contracting officer for each particular acquisition expected to exceed the SAT. The team should consist of a mix of staff, appropriate to the complexity of the acquisition, and may include fiscal, legal, administrative, and technical personnel, and such other expertise as necessary to assure a comprehensive acquisition plan. The team should include the small business advocate representing the contracting activity or a higher-level designee. At a minimum, the team must include the contracting officer and a representative of the Office of General Counsel and the requesting service. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) The contracting officer or the acquisition team, as appropriate, must conduct market research, including satisfying the requirements of 808.002(a)(2) and 873.107, Socioeconomic programs, and a VA Rule of Two determination (819.502-2). It is the responsibility of the contracting officer to ensure the requirement is appropriately publicized and information about the procurement opportunity is adequately disseminated as set forth in 873.107. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) In lieu of the requirements of FAR part 7 addressing documentation of the acquisition plan, the contracting officer may conduct an acquisition strategy meeting with cognizant offices to seek approval for the proposed acquisition approach. If a meeting is conducted, briefing materials shall be presented to address the acquisition plan topics and structure in FAR 7.105. Formal written minutes—summarizing decisions, actions, and conclusions—shall be prepared and included in the contract file, along with a copy of the briefing materials. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.106   Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals.

#### § 873.106

      (a) Exchange of information among all interested parties involved in an acquisition described in 873.104(b), from the earliest identification of a requirement through release of the solicitation, is encouraged. Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements in FAR 3.104. The nature and extent of exchanges between the Government and industry shall be a matter of the contracting officer's discretion (for acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) or the acquisition team's discretion, as coordinated by the contracting officer. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) Techniques to promote early exchange of information include—

      (1) Industry or small business conferences;

      (2) Public hearings;

      (3) Market research in accordance with FAR 10.002(b), which shall be followed to the extent that the provisions therein would provide relevant information;

      (4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors;

      (5) Presolicitation notices;

      (6) Draft requests for proposals (RFPs);

      (7) Requests for information (RFIs);

      (8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences;

      (9) Site visits;

      (10) Electronic notices (e.g., internet);

      (11) Use of the System for Award Management (SAM) (); and

      (12) Researching VA's Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database at

      873.107   Socioeconomic programs.

#### § 873.107

      (a) The Veterans First Contracting Program in VAAR subpart 819.70 takes precedence over other small business programs. (38 U.S.C. 8127-8128)

      (b)(1) Except for contract actions subject to 808.002(a)(2), competitive contract actions not otherwise excluded under this part shall be set-aside for VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns or veteran-owned small business (VOSB) concerns if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more eligible small business concerns owned and controlled by Veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. (38 U.S.C. 8127-8128)

      (2) The contracting officer shall proceed with the acquisition under the simplified procedures of this part considering priority sources (see 808.008(a)(2) and 873.103) and preferences for other small businesses in accordance with 819.203-70 and 819.7004. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) Without regard to FAR 13.003(b)(1), 19.203, 19.502, the head of the contracting activity (HCA) may approve a waiver from the requirement for any set-aside for small business participation when a waiver is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) The contracting officer shall ensure priorities for veteran-owned small businesses are implemented within the VA hierarchy of small business program preferences, established by 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128, as implemented in VAAR subpart 819.70, the Veterans First Contracting Program. Specifically, the contracting officer shall consider preferences for verified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) first, then preferences for verified veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs). These priorities will be followed by preferences for other small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.203, 819.203-70, and 819.7004. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.108   Publicizing contract actions.

#### § 873.108

      (a) All competitive acquisitions under this part, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for dollar amounts in excess of the SAT, shall be publicly announced utilizing a medium designed to permit all responsible sources, as appropriate under the provisions of this part, to submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as appropriate).

      (1) The publication medium may include the internet, including the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE), and local, regional or national publications or journals, as appropriate, at the discretion of the contracting officer, depending on the complexity of the acquisition.

      (2) Notice shall be published for a reasonable time prior to issuance of a solicitation, depending on the complexity or urgency of the acquisition, in order to afford potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the notice includes a complete copy of the request for quotation (RFQ) or solicitation, a prior notice is not required, and the RFQ or solicitation shall be considered to be announced and issued at the same time.

      (3) The notice may include contractor qualification parameters, such as time for delivery of service, credentialing or medical certification requirements, small business or other socio-economic preferences, the appropriate small business size standard, and such other qualifications as the contracting officer deems necessary to meet the needs of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) The requirement for public announcement does not apply to sole source acquisitions described in 873.104(a). However, as required by 38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(D), acquisitions from an institution not affiliated with the VA in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 7302, if conducted on a sole source basis, must still be justified and publicized (see 873.104(b)(2)). (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) For acquisitions below the SAT, a public announcement is optional. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) Each solicitation issued under the procedures in this part must prominently identify that the requirement is being solicited under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8153 and this part. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.109   General requirements for acquisition of health-care resources.

#### § 873.109

      (a)  Unless the head of the contracting activity (HCA) appoints another individual to serve as the Source Selection Authority (SSA), the contracting officer shall be the SSA for acquisitions of health-care resources, consisting of commercial services, or the use of medical equipment or space, utilizing the guidance contained in this part. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b)  The performance work statement (PWS) or statement of work (SOW) must define the requirement and should, in most instances, include qualifications or limitations such as time limits for delivery of service, medical certification or credentialing restrictions, and small business or other socio-economic preferences. The contracting officer may include any other such terms as the contracting officer deems appropriate for each specific acquisition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c)  Without regard to FAR 13.106-3(b), 13.501(b), or 15.406-3, the contract file must include—

      (1) A brief written description of the procedures used in awarding the contract;

      (2) A written determination that the health-care resources being procured are not otherwise feasibly available or that utilization of such health-care resources is necessary to meet mission requirements;

      (3) Documentation of market research and the results of such research;

      (4) The number of offers received; and

      (5) An explanation, tailored to the size and complexity of the acquisition, of the basis for the contract award decision. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d)  (1) Without regard to FAR 5.203, contracting officers shall set a reasonable time for receipt of quotations or proposals in the solicitations.

      (2) Without regard to FAR 15.208 or 52.212-1(f), quotations or proposals received after the time set forth in an RFQ or request for proposals (RFP) may be considered at the discretion of the contracting officer if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Contracting officers must document the rationale for accepting quotations or proposals received after the time specified in the RFQ or RFP. This paragraph (d)(2) shall not apply to RFQs or RFPs if alternative evaluation techniques described in 873.111(d)(1)(ii) are used. This paragraph (d)(2) does not apply to invitations for bid (IFBs). (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (e)  Any acquisition may be canceled by the contracting officer at any time during the acquisition process if cancellation is determined to be in the best interest of the Government and a memorandum for the record in included in the solicitation file explaining the reasons for the cancellation. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.110   Solicitation provisions.

#### § 873.110

      (a) As required in 873.109(d), contracting officers shall set a reasonable time for receipt of quotations or proposals and shall insert the provision at 852.273-70, Late Offers, in all RFQs and RFPs exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. However, this provision shall not be used if the provision 852.273-71, Alternative Negotiation Techniques, is to be used. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) The contracting officer shall insert a provision in RFQs and solicitations, substantially the same as the provision at 852.273-71, Alternative Negotiation Techniques, when either of the alternative negotiation techniques described in 873.111(d)(1) will be used. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 852.273-72, Alternative Evaluation, in lieu of FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation—Commercial Items, when the alternative negotiation technique described in 873.111(d)(1)(ii) will be used. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) When evaluation information, as described in 873.112, is to be used to select a contractor under a RFQ or RFP for health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space, the contracting officer may insert the provision at 852.273-73, Evaluation—Health-Care Resources, in the RFQ or RFP in lieu of FAR provision 52.212-2. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (e) As provided at 873.113(f), if award may be made without exchange with offerors, the contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.273-74, Award Without Exchanges, in the RFQ or RFP. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (f) The contracting officer shall insert the FAR clause at 52.207-3, Right of First Refusal of Employment, in all RFQs, solicitations, and contracts issued under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8151-8153 which may result in a conversion, from in-house performance to contract performance, of work currently being performed by Department of Veterans Affairs employees. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.111   Acquisition strategies for health-care resources.

#### § 873.111

      The following acquisition processes and techniques may be used, singly or in combination with others, as appropriate, to design acquisition strategies suitable for the complexity of the requirement and the amount of resources available to conduct the acquisition. These strategies should be considered during acquisition planning. The contracting officer shall select the process most appropriate to the particular acquisition. There is no preference for sealed bid acquisitions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (a)  (1) Without regard to FAR subparts 6.1 or 6.2, contracting officers must solicit a sufficient number of sources to promote competition to the maximum extent practicable and to ensure that the purchase is advantageous to the Government, based, as appropriate, on either price alone or price and other factors (e.g., past performance and quality). RFQs must notify vendors of the basis upon which the award is to be made. ( FAR 13.004)

      (2) For acquisitions in excess of the SAT, the procedures set forth in FAR part 13 concerning RFQs may be utilized without regard to the dollar thresholds contained therein. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b)  FAR part 14 provides procedures for sealed bidding.

      (c) —(1)  Without regard to FAR 15.202, multiphase acquisitions may be appropriate when the submission of full proposals at the beginning of an acquisition would be burdensome for offerors to prepare and for Government personnel to evaluate. Using multiphase techniques, the Government may seek limited information initially, make one or more down-selects, and request a full proposal from an individual offeror or limited number of offerors. Provided that the notice notifies offerors, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals during any phase to the number that will permit an efficient competition among proposals offering the greatest likelihood of award. The contracting officer may indicate in the notice an estimate of the greatest number of proposals that will be included in the down-select phase. The contracting officer may down-select to a single offeror. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (2)  In the first phase, the Government shall publish a notice (see 873.108) that solicits responses and that may provide, as appropriate, a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and the criteria that will be used to make the initial down-select decision. The notice may also inform offerors of the evaluation criteria or process that will be used in subsequent down-select decisions. The notice must contain sufficient information to allow potential offerors to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. The notice must advise offerors that failure to participate in the first phase will make them ineligible to participate in subsequent phases. The notice may be in the form of a synopsis in the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) or a narrative letter or other appropriate method that contains the information required by this paragraph. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (3)  Offerors shall submit the information requested in the notice described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Information sought in the first phase may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information (e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance information, limited pricing information). (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (4)  The Government shall evaluate all offerors' submissions in accordance with the notice and make a down-select decision. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (5)  Additional information shall be sought in the second phase so that a down-select can be performed or an award made without exchanges, if necessary. The contracting officer may conduct exchanges with remaining offeror(s), request proposal revisions, or request best and final offers, as determined necessary by the contracting officer, in order to make an award decision. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (6)  Without regard to FAR 15.505, contracting officers must debrief offerors whose proposals are not accepted under a competitive request for proposals (RFP) as required by 873.118. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d)  (1) Contracting officers may utilize alternative negotiation techniques for the acquisition of health-care resources. Alternative negotiation techniques may be used when award will be based on either price or price and other factors. Alternative negotiation techniques include but are not limited to:

      (i) Indicating to offerors a price, contract term or condition, commercially available feature, and/or requirement (beyond any requirement or target specified in the solicitation) that offerors will have to improve upon or meet, as appropriate, in order to remain competitive.

      (ii) Posting offered prices electronically or otherwise (without disclosing the identity of the offerors) and permitting revisions of offers based on this information.

      (2) Except as otherwise permitted by law, contracting officers shall not conduct acquisitions under this section in a manner that reveals the identities of offerors, releases proprietary information, or otherwise gives any offeror a competitive advantage ( FAR 3.104). (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.112   Evaluation information.

#### § 873.112

      (a) Without regard to FAR 15.304, Evaluation factors and significant subfactors (except for 15.304(c)(1) and (c)(3), which do apply to acquisitions under this authority), the criteria, factors, or other evaluation information that apply to an acquisition, and their relative importance, are within the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials as long as the evaluation information is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) Price or cost to the Government must be evaluated in every source selection. Past performance shall be evaluated in source selections for competitive acquisitions exceeding the SAT unless the contracting officer documents that past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) The quality of the product or service may be addressed in source selection through consideration of information such as past compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications, and prior experience. The information required from quoters, bidders, or offerors shall be included in notices or solicitations, as appropriate. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) The relative importance of any evaluation information included in a solicitation must be set forth therein. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.113   Exchanges with offerors.

#### § 873.113

      (a) Without regard to FAR 15.201 or 15.306, acquisitions generally involve exchanges between the Government and competing offerors. Open exchanges support the goal of efficiency in Government by providing the Government with relevant information (in addition to that submitted in the offeror's initial proposal) needed to understand and evaluate the offeror's proposal. The nature and extent of exchanges between the Government and offerors is a matter of contracting officer judgment. Clarifications, communications, and discussions are not applicable to acquisitions under this part. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) Exchanges with potential offerors may take place throughout the source selection process. Exchanges may start in the planning stages and continue through contract award. Exchanges should occur most often with offerors determined to be in the best value pool (see 873.114). The purpose of exchanges is to ensure there is mutual understanding between the Government and the offerors on all aspects of the acquisition, including offerors' submittals/proposals. Information disclosed as a result of oral or written exchanges with an offeror may be considered in the evaluation of an offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) Exchanges may be conducted, in part, to obtain information that explains or resolves ambiguities or other concerns (e.g., perceived errors, omissions, or deficiencies) in an Offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) Exchanges shall only be initiated if authorized by the contracting officer and need not be conducted with all offerors. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (e) Except for acquisitions based on alternative negotiation techniques contained in 873.111(d)(1), the contracting officer and other Government personnel involved in the acquisition shall not disclose information regarding one offeror's proposal to other offerors without consent of the offeror in accordance with FAR parts 3 and 24. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (f) Award may be made on initial proposals without exchanges if the solicitation states that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without exchanges, unless the contracting officer determines that exchanges are considered necessary. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.114   Best value pool.

#### § 873.114

      (a) Without regard to FAR 15.306(c), the contracting officer may determine the most highly rated proposals having the greatest likelihood of award based on the information or factors and subfactors in the solicitation. These vendors constitute the best value pool. This determination is within the sole discretion of the contracting officer. Competitive range determinations are not applicable to acquisitions under this part 873. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) In planning an acquisition, the contracting officer may determine that the number of proposals that would otherwise be included in the best value pool is expected to exceed the number at which an efficient, timely, and economical competition can be conducted. In reaching such a conclusion, the contracting officer may consider such factors as the results of market research, historical data from previous acquisitions for similar services, and the resources available to conduct the source selection. Provided the solicitation notifies offerors that the best value pool can be limited for purposes of making an efficient, timely, and economical award, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the best value pool to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the proposals offering the greatest likelihood of award. The contracting officer may indicate in the solicitation the estimate of the greatest number of proposals that will be included in the best value pool. The contracting officer may limit the best value pool to a single offeror. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) If the contracting officer determines that an offeror's proposal is no longer in the best value pool, the proposal shall no longer be considered for award. Written notice of this decision must be provided to unsuccessful offerors at the earliest practicable time. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.115   Proposal revisions.

#### § 873.115

      (a) The contracting officer may request proposal revisions as often as needed during the proposal evaluation process at any time prior to award from vendors remaining in the best value pool. Proposal revisions shall be submitted in writing. The contracting officer may establish a common cutoff date for receipt of proposal revisions. Contracting officers may request best and final offers n. In any case, contracting officers and acquisition team members must safeguard all proposals and revisions to avoid unfair dissemination of an offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) If an offeror initially included in the best value pool is no longer considered to be among those most likely to receive award after submission of proposal revisions and subsequent evaluation thereof, the offeror may be eliminated from the best value pool without being afforded an opportunity to submit further proposal revisions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) Requesting and/or receiving proposal revisions does not necessarily conclude exchanges. However, requests for proposal revisions should advise offerors that the Government may make award without obtaining further revisions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.116   Source selection decision.

#### § 873.116

      (a) An integrated comparative assessment of proposals should be performed before source selection is made. The SSA shall independently determine which proposal(s) represents the best value, consistent with the evaluation information or factors and subfactors in the solicitation, and that the prices are fair and reasonable. The SSA may determine that all proposals should be rejected if it is in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) The source selection team, or advisory boards or panels, may conduct comparative analysis(es) of proposals and make award recommendations, if the SSA requests such assistance. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) The source selection decision must be documented in accordance with FAR 15.308. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.117   Award to successful offeror.

#### § 873.117

      (a) The contracting officer shall award a contract to the successful offeror by furnishing the contract or other notice of the award to that offeror. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (b) If a request for proposal (RFP) process was used for the solicitation and if award is to be made without exchanges, the contracting officer may award a contract without obtaining the offeror's signature a second time. The offeror's signature on the offer constitutes the offeror's agreement to be bound by the offer. If a request for quotation (RFQ) process was used for the solicitation, and if the contracting officer determines there is a need to establish a binding contract prior to commencement of work, the contracting officer should obtain the offeror's acceptance signature on the contract to ensure formation of a binding contract. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (c) If the award document includes information that is different than the latest signed offer, both the offeror and the contracting officer must sign the contract award. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      (d) When an award is made to an offeror for less than all of the items that may be awarded and additional items are being withheld for subsequent award, each notice shall state that the Government may make subsequent awards on those additional items within the offer acceptance period. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

      873.118   Debriefings.

#### § 873.118

      Offerors whose proposals are not accepted under a competitive request for proposals (RFP) may submit a written request for a debriefing to the contracting officer. Without regard to FAR 15.505, preaward debriefings may be conducted by the contracting officer when determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Post-award debriefings shall be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.506. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
